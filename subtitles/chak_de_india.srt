1
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:28,350
New Delhi's National Sports stadium..
The stadium is filled to the brim.

2
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:35,160
Only 2 minutes left in the
World Men's Hockey Championship..

3
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,523
India is one goal behind Pakistan.

4
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,655
Vijay, pass it here!

5
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:43,168
Indian Captain Kabir Khan, Asia's
best center forward pushing his team

6
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,363
Come on! Come on!

7
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,206
Suspense in the audience.

8
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:58,350
Tension on the faces
of the officials..

9
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,009
Like every lndia-Pakistan match,

10
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:05,183
this match means so much
more than the game itself.

11
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,153
Only 1 and a half minutes now

12
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,525
and lndia will have to
fight quickly to save itself.

13
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:16,160
Ball with Pakistani
defender Waseem.. Scoop!

14
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:25,103
But lndian defender Uttam Singh
snatches it.. India is now on attack!

15
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,517
And a penalty stroke for lndia..

16
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:13,684
A breath of life
they desperately need..

17
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,621
But who will take this stroke..

18
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,164
Ball! Ball!

19
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,194
Saini has the ball, but Captain
Kabir is taking the stroke himself..

20
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:25,629
Maybe a good decision.

21
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:29,503
India's best player
is its last hope...

22
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,256
Coach, is this the same team
that defeated Pakistan last year?

23
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,687
No comments.

24
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,855
Do you not think our
team is taking it too easy?

25
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,488
Please, please, no comments.

26
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,526
Hey, look, it is Kabir!
- Kabir!

27
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,264
He is here!
- Kabir.. Kabir.. Kabir,

28
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,430
do you have anything to say
about such an embarrassing defeat?

29
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,701
Do you really believe
Pakistan's performance was better?

30
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,607
Maybe. - Why did you take
the penalty stroke yourself?

31
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,737
I made a mistake

32
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,213
Rumour has it that the Pakistani
players are your good friends..

33
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:19,581
you were the only lndian to
congratulate them after the match..

34
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,877
Excuse me!

35
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,215
People are saying..
there is a rumour that you..

36
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:25,382
or someone else in the lndian team
has deliberately thrown this match?

37
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,549
Excuse me!

38
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,526
Do you think we lost
because someone sold out?

39
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,292
What! What did you say?

40
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,594
Kabir Khan, has
someone sold out their team?

41
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,726
Sold out! You piece of..

42
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:41,664
How dare you..

43
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,507
How can you disrespect the media!

44
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,310
Disrespect the media!
You son of a.. Come here.

45
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,408
You do not know how
to treat journalists!

46
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,883
You bloody -.. sold out

47
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,415
Come back here!

48
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,257
You just witnessed a
frustrated captain of the loosing

49
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,591
team attack the media violently.

50
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,254
His outburst cannot
hide the fact that there..

51
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,460
..is definitely
something fishy going on.

52
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,329
We have our answers.

53
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,268
But it is now up to
you to decide whether

54
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,399
Kabir Khan has played
dirty with the country or not.

55
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,777
Satyavrat Yadav,
National Stadium, New Delhi..

56
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,871
News from the world of sports.

57
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,283
Pakistan has become the
new Hockey World Champions

58
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,345
after defeating lndia by one goal.

59
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:40,293
Today the Chairman of the
Hockey Association denounced

60
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:44,803
Kabir Khan, declared he
did his country wrong.

61
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,363
And all this is thanks to you..
the lndian public.

62
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,635
We have two special guests..

63
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,581
Down with Kabir!

64
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,878
What do you think? Did
Kabir Khan fix the match?

65
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,786
Do not know if he fixed the match,
but we lost because of him.

66
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:06,916
And what would you say?

67
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,858
These people should
be hung upside down.

68
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,986
And you?

69
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:13,759
These kind of people should have
moved to Pakistan during the partition.

70
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,394
Down with Kabir!

71
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,401
The public is upset with
the team's performance.

72
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,568
And Kabir Khan has
conveniently disappeared.

73
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,807
He was not at the hockey stadium, nor
the Sports Authority of lndia Campus.

74
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,938
Where is Kabir Khan?

75
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,817
Do not look back mother, let us go.

76
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,553
How can I not, Kabir..

77
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:23,926
Your grandfather saved every
penny to build this house..

78
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:30,101
Your father's first pay check
went into making these windows..

79
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,803
I stepped into this
home as a young bride..

80
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:40,141
Whatever happens, I know all these
people will stand by us, trust me.

81
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:49,853
My master

82
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,089
TRAlTOR

83
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,134
Do not look there, son.

84
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,507
You can close your eyes if
you can not bear to see it..

85
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:05,936
I want to see everything.

86
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,036
TRAlTOR

87
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,809
Come son. Let us go!

88
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:14,850
The third colour of
your being, that was l

89
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,515
Papa, papa, I want to see
what a traitor looks like.

90
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:18,715
Come, see!

91
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:24,627
Your tune was the rhythm of my life

92
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,460
Just some food for the road..

93
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:27,794
Do you want us to be
thrown out of the neighbourhood?

94
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,961
My divine master, you are my pride

95
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:40,969
My master, my life is yours to take

96
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:32,757
So, what have you decided?

97
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:37,733
Uttamji, you are always
harping on the same thing.

98
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,599
What should we do about the coach?

99
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:42,999
Hey, why don't you
become their coach?

100
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,907
The Women's Hockey World Cup
is just three months away.

101
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,707
The team cannot just go
without any training..

102
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,745
No matter how much you
train them, they will loose..

103
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,051
The lndian Women's hockey
team has never achieved anything

104
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,178
and it never will.

105
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,219
It is a government trip.

106
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,719
Why do you not go as their coach?

107
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:08,798
The team will be out in a
couple of matches. Exit!

108
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,201
You and your wife
could enjoy a holiday.

109
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,768
I do not get it - why do you not
take women's hockey seriously.

110
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,709
And we do no get why
you take it so seriously.

111
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:29,283
Uttamji, lndian women
are born to cook and clean.

112
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:33,657
They cannot run
around in short skirts.

113
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,828
How can an Association
member say such things?

114
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:38,955
It is because we are
in the Association

115
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,192
and have travelled around the
world, that we can say such things.

116
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:48,836
Look, you have done your part and
selected the top 1 6 lndian players.

117
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:55,972
Punjab, Tamil Nadu,
Jharkand, Andhra, Railways.

118
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:00,285
You have even been to
remote Manipur and Mizoram.

119
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:04,017
But now where will you
find a coach? From the moon?

120
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,090
Is this also the girls' fault?

121
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:08,853
No, It is not the girls' fault.

122
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,224
It is the fault, of people like
you with expectations from them.

123
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:17,702
No sponsors.. no viewers..
no TV coverage, nor media..

124
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:22,240
Now which coach will want to jump
into this mess to ruin his career?

125
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,707
Is there anyone? No one.

126
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:26,335
There is one man.

127
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,038
Who?

128
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,008
Kabir.

129
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,778
Who?

130
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:36,913
Kabir Khan.

131
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:40,885
The Kabir Khan who..

132
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,018
Yes that one.

133
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,787
Since when has he developed
an interest in women's hockey?

134
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,995
He even left men's hockey years ago.

135
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,895
No one has seen him
for six-seven years.

136
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,094
You can see him now.

137
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,229
Where?

138
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,738
Outside. In the reception.

139
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:15,159
Do not attack the opposing
team's goal but their minds.

140
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,758
You will win the goal automatically.

141
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,057
Sir
- Hmm?

142
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,190
You have been called inside.

143
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,335
Sir
- Kabir.

144
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,111
How many years has it..

145
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:40,778
Seven years, three months.. ten,
eleven, twelve, thirteen

146
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,218
7 years, 3 months, 14 days.

147
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:47,820
What.. what were you
doing all these years?

148
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,857
I was preparing for this meeting.

149
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,931
He wants to be the coach of
the lndian Women's Hockey Team.

150
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,804
You are not a child Mr. Kabir Khan.

151
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,734
You know in a country like ours,

152
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:08,212
a women's team exists just
as a formality, not a reality.

153
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:13,816
Your reputation is already..

154
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:22,156
And you wish to redeem your
name by coaching this team.

155
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:28,198
A team that is not fit to play
against European high schools.

156
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,099
This is exactly the team I want.

157
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,071
I do not understand..

158
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,106
I do not think you would.

159
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,946
So shall I consider myself hired?

160
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,227
In any case, you do
not have another coach.

161
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,907
I have done all I could,

162
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,945
but you should think about it.

163
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,177
I have.

164
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,250
Kabir this not a team.
It is a graveyard.

165
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,319
Why are you burying in it?

166
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,195
This team will never get
a better coach than you.

167
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,963
But think about yourself.

168
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,156
I am thinking about myself.

169
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:40,005
You have changed.
You have changed a lot.

170
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:44,074
I have not changed. Nothing has.

171
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,177
You know we did not lose
that match because of you.

172
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,213
You did all you could to
score a goal against Pakistan

173
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:59,049
But they scored against me, my
team, my country.. and my family.

174
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,358
Everybody is allowed one mistake.

175
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,189
Everybody?

176
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,931
Kabir, why have you come back?

177
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,204
To help this team to
win the World Cup.

178
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,336
Which is impossible..

179
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,573
Is what needs to be done.

180
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,317
when are your 1 6 girls coming?

181
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,549
They should reach here tomorrow
morning from their respective states.

182
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:32,414
States.. nothing has changed.

183
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,187
There were states then,
there are states now..

184
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,817
There you go..

185
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:12,754
Well ma'am, once again it looks like

186
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,322
the Association has
dumped all of lndia on us.

187
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:18,902
So these are the best?

188
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:20,061
That's what they say.

189
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,873
Wasn't she the
goalkeeper for the Railways?

190
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:26,134
What was her name?

191
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:28,109
Vidya.. Vidya Sharma.

192
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:32,141
Heard she got
married and quit hockey?

193
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:33,942
Well she's here..

194
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:45,156
1 00 rupees? My foot! Is
the meter for decoration?

195
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:46,890
The meter is broken, you
will have to give me 1 00.

196
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,865
I will give you 1 00 slaps!
- What sort of talk is that?

197
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:51,993
The kind you will understand! Take the
50 or I will shove the hockey stick!

198
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,128
Don't get angry.

199
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,704
Your head will
explode one of these days.

200
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:57,775
But grandma, you are not
saying anything to him.

201
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:59,968
Is he my baby or are you?

202
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,009
I am.
- So?

203
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,342
Cool down, come, come.. drink it in.

204
00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:35,735
Hey! What the.. you brats!

205
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,074
Hey Komal!

206
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,189
These pansies! Thought
I'd show them how to play!

207
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:49,126
You haven't come
here to play with boys!

208
00:18:49,227 --> 00:18:50,285
No.. just wanted to check out

209
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:52,124
whether these Delhi dudes can play.

210
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:53,924
There's no way I'm letting my
girl play in a big city like Delhi.

211
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,966
Come on. Let's go,
get back in the car

212
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,092
Oh come now! We have come this far..

213
00:18:57,168 --> 00:18:58,692
Let her do what
she wants. After all,

214
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,068
she will be playing a home
maker for the rest of her life.

215
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,197
I will never give up playing!

216
00:19:02,273 --> 00:19:03,968
Oh yeah? What will you feed
your husband when he is hungry?

217
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,100
This!

218
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:06,803
Enough! I don't want
my girl playing hockey.

219
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:12,144
Once she slips out of our grasp,
who will ask for her hand?

220
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,308
Let them try!

221
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,794
Gul, your grandfathers,
your father, your brother

222
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:28,991
all have excelled in
this game, my dear.

223
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:33,101
Now it is your turn.
Don't let the lqbals down.

224
00:19:44,415 --> 00:19:46,144
Name please.
- Ho?

225
00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:49,279
Ho? Name. What is your name?

226
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:50,879
Soimoi.

227
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:53,287
I asked for your name.
Not your medical condition.

228
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,416
Soimoi.

229
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,225
Is that your name?
- Ho.

230
00:19:56,461 --> 00:20:00,158
Ho again? Your full name..
name! Name!

231
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:03,960
Soimoi Kerketa. She
doesn't understand English.

232
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,899
And you are?
- Rani (Queen)

233
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:09,940
Have you escaped from an asylum?
What do you want?

234
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,235
Rani Dispotta.

235
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:13,968
Are you from the travelling theatre?

236
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,379
The stadium won't be
available till the new year. Go away!

237
00:20:20,184 --> 00:20:24,484
Ghamorni.. state board.. Jharkhand..

238
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,183
Oh dear!

239
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,219
These two are hockey players!

240
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,354
Ho, ho, ho!

241
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,901
Name?
- Nethra Reddy.

242
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:39,060
So you are a Madrasi?

243
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:40,929
Telegu.

244
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:42,063
Tamil.

245
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,266
Not Tamil, Telegu.

246
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:46,901
Same thing. What's the
difference between Tamil and Telegu?

247
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:50,139
The same difference that is
there between Punjabi and Bihari.

248
00:20:50,214 --> 00:20:51,272
Oh really?

249
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,176
Can I go?

250
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:55,944
What?

251
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,078
Ho ho!

252
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:16,934
Man! Look at that vanilla ice
cream amidst all this chocolate!

253
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:18,840
Must be heading to a
disco or a nightclub..

254
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,174
Looks like they lost their way.

255
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:24,509
You think they are players?

256
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:26,948
Definitely players. But not here..

257
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:30,145
Ya? Wonder what
the going rates are..

258
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:32,449
Why don't you ask them? They
won't get our language anyway

259
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,480
Hey, how much are those melons for?

260
00:21:37,228 --> 00:21:39,560
What the.. They understand Hindi!

261
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,956
Thought they were
Chinese or Nepali..

262
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,002
Molly Zimik, Manipur.
Mary Ralte, Mizoram.

263
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:50,231
Wow! You have come from the
furthest reaches of lndia.

264
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:53,300
You are our special guests. Welcome!

265
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:56,946
What.. are you not happy?

266
00:21:57,148 --> 00:21:59,548
Would you be happy being treated
like an alien in your own country?

267
00:22:16,534 --> 00:22:18,263
Bindia, Aliya how are you?

268
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,097
Pretty fit.

269
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:24,604
How's your injury Gunjan?

270
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:27,467
An injury madam will take
its own sweet time to go.

271
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,607
You are the senior players.
Behave like one.

272
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:32,540
Be respectful around the new coach.

273
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,313
Respect, madam, will
take its own time to come.

274
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,149
Sukhlal! Become older!

275
00:22:56,307 --> 00:23:00,107
My name is Kabir Khan. I'm the Coach

276
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:02,937
of the lndian National
Women's Hockey Team..

277
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,380
which I have been
told are you girls.

278
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,081
All the players here, Krishnaji?

279
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,046
Yes sir. Only one's missing..
Uh, Preeti Sabarwal

280
00:23:12,156 --> 00:23:14,215
Reporting time was 10 am, wasn't it?

281
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,350
Excuse me!

282
00:23:17,361 --> 00:23:19,454
Is this the
registration for the women's team?

283
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,491
The registration for the lndian
National Women's team is over.

284
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,525
Bloody hell! I'm Preeti Sabarwal.

285
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,234
Bloody hell Preeti Sabarwal!
You are very late. Try next year.

286
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:31,432
Sorry?

287
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:32,567
Next year.

288
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:35,674
Sorry?
- Next year!

289
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,241
Everybody, fall in line please!

290
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:38,373
Ho?

291
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:40,106
Come on everyone, line up.

292
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:48,483
She is a good player, sir.

293
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:54,121
I will be the judge of who is a
good player or a bad player Krishnaji.

294
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:55,357
Thank you.

295
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:59,698
You.. you can't keep out
a state team captain..

296
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:03,573
Which state team's captain are you?
- Chandigarh

297
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,074
Is this the Chandigarh team?

298
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,669
No.

299
00:24:09,747 --> 00:24:11,612
But I'm a captain of a state team.

300
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,344
And I'm the coach of the
lndian National Women's Team.

301
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:18,286
I cannot hear or see
the names of states.

302
00:24:18,656 --> 00:24:21,386
I can only hear the name
of one country - lndia.

303
00:24:21,492 --> 00:24:25,553
And in that team, there is
no place for late comers.

304
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,722
Everyone understand that?

305
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:32,669
OK..OK, kit up.

306
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:37,734
Kit up and do 10
rounds in exactly 7 minutes.

307
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,407
If you are done in 7 minutes,
come join the team.

308
00:24:40,678 --> 00:24:43,272
If not, take the
train back to Chandigarh.

309
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:46,375
Sir, 7 minutes!

310
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,508
Sshhh, Krishnaji.

311
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:54,117
Now each player will step
forward and introduce herself.

312
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,185
You!

313
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:58,556
Balbir Kaur, Punjab

314
00:25:00,464 --> 00:25:01,522
Again.

315
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:03,632
Balbir Kaur, Punjab

316
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:05,594
Again.

317
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,365
Balbir Kaur, Punjab

318
00:25:07,471 --> 00:25:09,496
Break away from the
team and step aside.

319
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:11,667
Komal Chautala, Haryana

320
00:25:11,742 --> 00:25:12,800
Out!

321
00:25:13,077 --> 00:25:14,408
Molly Zimik, Manipur
- Out!

322
00:25:14,478 --> 00:25:16,070
Nethra Reddy, Andhra Pradesh

323
00:25:16,213 --> 00:25:17,646
Out
- Rachna Prasad, Bihar.

324
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:19,540
Nichola Sequeira, Maharashtra

325
00:25:19,617 --> 00:25:20,675

326
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:21,809
Vidya Sharma, lndia

327
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:26,214
Hmm?

328
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,348
Vidya Sharma, lndia

329
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:28,516
Once more loudly.

330
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,151
Vidya Sharma, lndia

331
00:25:30,294 --> 00:25:32,228
Thank you. You are on the team.

332
00:25:33,464 --> 00:25:38,401
Anyone else who is playing for Punjab,
Himachal, Tamil Nadu, Railways?

333
00:25:39,503 --> 00:25:44,440
Understand this once and for all,
because I won't repeat it.

334
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,273
This team needs only those
players who first play for lndia,

335
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,339
then for their teammates,

336
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:55,610
and then if they have any
life left, for themselves.

337
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:03,485
Not those who are playing for a
Government job or a Railway flat. Hmmm?

338
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:04,619
Ho!

339
00:26:04,695 --> 00:26:08,529
Ho? Let's try one
more time. Come, please.

340
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,463

00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:34,586
Gunjan Lakhani, lndia

354
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:37,385
Bindia Naik, lndia

355
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:42,292
Preeti Sabarwal, lndia

356
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,547
Come on, move it, move it

357
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,635
Didi(elder sister), didi! You
are Bindia Naik, aren't you?

358
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:20,733
You hold a National
record of 42 goals!

359
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:21,863
So?

360
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:24,407
I am so happy to meet you!

361
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:25,769
Yay! Go dance then!

362
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:46,558
On the list this is my bed.

363
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:50,292
There's the list. Go sleep there.

364
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,361
Forget it Molly!

365
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:54,629
Correct.

366
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,364
Hello! I am Nethra.

367
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,498
Vidya.

368
00:27:57,575 --> 00:28:01,477
I know. You saved 4 goals in
the South Zone tournament.

369
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:03,743
Didn't save them,
just happened somehow.

370
00:28:03,814 --> 00:28:04,872
It was all luck.

371
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:07,476
Only good players have good 'luck'.

372
00:28:13,724 --> 00:28:15,988
Whoa.. what's this?

373
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:18,719
Ho?

374
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:20,421
What is this?

375
00:28:20,531 --> 00:28:22,362
'Moke daayar se laglak'

376
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,697
She is saying a branch scraped her
while travelling on an elephant.

377
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,532
You came to Delhi on an elephant?

378
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,403
No, only till Gha-morni. (morni
- peacock)

379
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:35,774
Peacocks? What peacock?
Peacocks, elephants..

380
00:28:35,846 --> 00:28:37,609
You live in a zoo?

381
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,715
Jharkhand. We are from Jharkhand.

382
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,712
[Jhadi=bush]

383
00:28:44,555 --> 00:28:46,489
Oh! Lots of bushes there?

384
00:28:46,824 --> 00:28:49,486
Jungle. It is a jungle there.

385
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:52,357
Jungle? Are you Junglees?

386
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,760
You eat snakes and scorpions? I
hope there aren't any in your bag?

387
00:28:57,468 --> 00:29:01,404
Are you upset?

388
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:05,470
Alright! Here
- you sleep on the floor.

389
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:16,447
What are you doing?

390
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:17,680
Sorry?

391
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:20,382
Nothing to be sorry about..
move this..

392
00:29:20,524 --> 00:29:22,651
What the
- What do you think you're doing?

393
00:29:22,726 --> 00:29:23,954
This is my bed.

394
00:29:24,595 --> 00:29:26,790
Did you not see
this big bundle here?

395
00:29:26,864 --> 00:29:27,922
So?

396
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:30,967
So? I put it here first,
so the bed is mine.

397
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:33,698
Just because you dumped
this bundle, it is your bed?

398
00:29:33,804 --> 00:29:36,398
Of course! Haven't you
ever been on a state bus?

399
00:29:36,507 --> 00:29:38,407
I have reserved this bed first!

400
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:40,533
It is mine on the list.

401
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:45,746
Oh you.. what the..

402
00:29:54,758 --> 00:29:56,419
I will smash your face!

403
00:29:56,493 --> 00:29:57,551
Hey kid!

404
00:29:58,729 --> 00:30:00,560
Get here.

405
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,657
C'mon!

406
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,809
There is a time and
place for every fight.

407
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:16,846
Save this one for another day
- when you have the upper hand.

408
00:30:18,515 --> 00:30:19,607
Get out!

409
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:23,977
Come. Be on this side with us.

410
00:30:34,498 --> 00:30:36,557
The travelling theatre
would have been better!

411
00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:41,402
I am told that from
the 250 million girls

412
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:45,465
in this country you are
the 16 best hockey players.

413
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:50,841
You're lucky, but also unlucky.

414
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:54,677
Because now I'll be the judge.

415
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,550
For me, you are only 16
girls who dabble in hockey.

416
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:04,494
Don't expect anymore.
You'll regret it.

417
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:18,806
Ten kilometers. Everyone Come on!

418
00:31:19,576 --> 00:31:20,770
Come on, girls!

419
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:23,680
Training us for a
marathon or a match?

420
00:31:54,878 --> 00:31:55,936
Hey!

421
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,053
Running at 4am won't make
us better hockey players.

422
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:19,560
How dare he treat national
players like this! We're not kids.

423
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,135
Does he think we
don't know how to train?

424
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:32,781
Move, you..

425
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:39,149
Take your positions.
What's going on?

426
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,852
What's the problem?

427
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:45,653
You are playing right in.

428
00:32:45,729 --> 00:32:46,787
But sir..

429
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,695
I think you will
play better as right in.

430
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,792
But.. I have always played
center forward for our Haryana team..

431
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:55,702
Ok, go! Play for the Haryana team.
Everybody in position!

432
00:33:06,016 --> 00:33:07,074
What is it?

433
00:33:07,184 --> 00:33:08,981
Coach sir has instructed me
to play on the forward line.

434
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:12,645
Go home and play.

435
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:22,626
Listen
- push her out and take her place.

436
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:23,961
But the coach has asked me
to play in this position.

437
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:26,059
So if the coach asks you
to jump in a well, you will?

438
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:27,695
But the coach..

439
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:32,140
Look, coaches will come and go.
But you will be with us, right?

440
00:33:32,843 --> 00:33:34,037
Yes, but coach..

441
00:33:34,111 --> 00:33:35,908
See, she's leaving to
drink water. Grab her place.

442
00:33:36,947 --> 00:33:38,972
Don't take my name.

443
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:47,715
What's going on?

444
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:51,959
I play forward every year.

445
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:53,654
Yes but in this team
you are the centre..

446
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:56,290
This team or that team it
doesn't make a difference.

447
00:33:57,067 --> 00:33:58,762
It makes a difference to the team.

448
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:01,031
You're a senior player,
a strong player.

449
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:06,174
The team needs you at centre half.
Go to your new position.

450
00:34:07,978 --> 00:34:09,036
Sorry.

451
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,738
Hmmm.

452
00:34:14,084 --> 00:34:15,142
Out.

453
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,277
What..

454
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:19,186
Sit out and let the
others play.. Out!

455
00:35:04,801 --> 00:35:06,200
Move!

456
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,414
Good goal! Very
good Preeti Sabarwal!

457
00:35:25,956 --> 00:35:27,321
Come on everyone, back to one!

458
00:35:40,837 --> 00:35:42,134
Komal! Pass the ball!

459
00:35:44,107 --> 00:35:46,166
I'm free, dammit, pass the ball!

460
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,092
Komal! Komal!

461
00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:13,193
What was that?

462
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:14,896
I scored a goal sir!

463
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:16,063
Out!

464
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:21,876
But you didn't see
what that girl was up to!

465
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,810
I saw everything
that's going on here.

466
00:36:23,914 --> 00:36:25,939
When she scored the goal
there was no one around her,

467
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,277
But when you scored, she was there.

468
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,150
And the only one in
the scoring position..

469
00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:35,382
Out!

470
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:44,298
Everybody can only see the
Memsahib but are blind to her faults.

471
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:47,893
The British have gone but left
behind their Memsahibs in cities.

472
00:36:48,038 --> 00:36:49,335
Just step in my village once!

473
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,933
If I don't tie you up with the
buffalo's tail, you can change my name.

474
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,137
Coach took Memsahib's side.

475
00:36:57,981 --> 00:37:00,347
He's only a coach, not God.

476
00:37:06,923 --> 00:37:09,483
Come let us rest for a while.

477
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:24,065
Hey!

478
00:37:41,224 --> 00:37:42,282
Out..

479
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,838
So chowmein! Get angry once more and

480
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,466
They will pour chilli
sauce on you and chew you up.

481
00:38:05,546 --> 00:38:06,945
Come, come here!

482
00:38:07,548 --> 00:38:12,542
Take it, take it, take it, damn you!

483
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:16,886
Moka! Moka (Pass to me!)

484
00:38:17,992 --> 00:38:21,018
Stop it, stop that, stop the ball..

485
00:38:22,864 --> 00:38:24,889
You piece of.. go kill
yourself or I will kill you.

486
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:27,860
The bloody..

487
00:38:28,569 --> 00:38:29,627
What happened?

488
00:38:29,704 --> 00:38:31,604
Did you not see? This
witch let them score a goal!

489
00:38:31,773 --> 00:38:33,832
You know she can not
understand Punjabi.

490
00:38:33,908 --> 00:38:35,637
She should have learnt
it before coming here!

491
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,869
She was only supposed to have
learnt hockey. Which she has.

492
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:39,671
Apologize to her.

493
00:38:39,947 --> 00:38:41,847
I have never apologized
- not even to my father!

494
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:42,974
Out..

495
00:38:43,051 --> 00:38:44,109
What!

496
00:38:44,218 --> 00:38:45,708
Out! Out!

497
00:38:46,754 --> 00:38:48,847
Why do you not tell her off?

498
00:38:48,956 --> 00:38:50,787
She is not worth talking to

499
00:38:52,226 --> 00:38:54,091
I have always said
- do not play with Junglees!

500
00:38:57,932 --> 00:38:59,593
You look very angry.

501
00:39:00,635 --> 00:39:02,000
You looked like you
would break her head..

502
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,128
Should I break yours?

503
00:39:17,952 --> 00:39:21,012
Sir, how long should
these girls be benched?

504
00:39:23,157 --> 00:39:24,249
Don't know.

505
00:39:26,627 --> 00:39:29,790
I do not think anyone can teach
these girls to play hockey together.

506
00:39:29,964 --> 00:39:32,023
Teaching them hockey
is a long way off.

507
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:34,931
I need to teach them
something else first.

508
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:37,896
Good evening!

509
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,068
What is going on?

510
00:40:17,678 --> 00:40:18,804
New sleeping arrangements?

511
00:40:19,247 --> 00:40:21,147
Old.. according to the old list.

512
00:40:21,215 --> 00:40:22,944
So? Tell them the list tore..

513
00:40:23,317 --> 00:40:24,909
come on, go to your old place.

514
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:27,681
No girl will stay with
another girl from her own state.

515
00:40:27,788 --> 00:40:28,914
It is the Coach's order.

516
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,988
So let him say it. Who cares?

517
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:33,117
Everyone else has agreed.

518
00:40:33,194 --> 00:40:35,822
If you have any
problems speak to the coach.

519
00:40:37,899 --> 00:40:41,130
Bake in sun all day,
switch beds at night..

520
00:40:42,336 --> 00:40:44,770
Is this a National
camp or a refugee camp?

521
00:40:45,273 --> 00:40:49,369
Why doesn't he make every
one sleep on the benches?

522
00:40:52,713 --> 00:40:53,805
How are you?

523
00:40:53,881 --> 00:40:55,280
I have had enough, please come back.

524
00:40:55,716 --> 00:40:56,910
I cannot come.

525
00:40:56,984 --> 00:41:00,715
It is uncle Samir's sister's wedding.
Mom and dad asked me to call you.

526
00:41:00,821 --> 00:41:02,721
Rakesh you know this
is the National camp-

527
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:03,882
But Vidya..

528
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:07,086
Look, family comes first,
games later..

529
00:41:07,161 --> 00:41:08,253
But, father-in-law..

530
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:10,194
Look, you insisted,
so we let you play.

531
00:41:10,298 --> 00:41:12,357
Now we are calling you, so
come back by the next train.

532
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:13,791
Yes.. but l..

533
00:41:17,138 --> 00:41:19,265
Rakesh please understand.
I cannot come.

534
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,935
I have waited a long
time for this camp.

535
00:41:22,043 --> 00:41:24,876
Vidya, you are a saint.
But I am not.

536
00:41:25,012 --> 00:41:26,673
I cannot keep waiting. The
wedding is day after tomorrow.

537
00:41:26,747 --> 00:41:28,772
Come if you want or forget it.

538
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:43,189
So?

539
00:41:43,264 --> 00:41:44,697
They wanted a
traditional daughter-in-law..

540
00:41:44,765 --> 00:41:46,858
..grandchildren, the
whole work from me..

541
00:41:49,203 --> 00:41:51,068
..but all I have is
this hockey stick.

542
00:41:51,172 --> 00:41:55,336
Oh! Is this how you scare them away?

543
00:41:59,947 --> 00:42:03,405
If you want, you can go
home for a couple of days.

544
00:42:04,919 --> 00:42:07,046
If I go now, I will not come back.

545
00:42:07,788 --> 00:42:10,086
It is either this side. Or that.

546
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,360
But.. When you
were getting married..

547
00:42:18,432 --> 00:42:21,094
I told them everything.
They were thrilled then..

548
00:42:22,203 --> 00:42:24,933
I had a job thanks to the sports
quota as well as a government flat.

549
00:42:27,441 --> 00:42:29,966
So now?

550
00:42:31,812 --> 00:42:32,870
They have gotten used to the flat,..

551
00:42:32,947 --> 00:42:35,006
..now they want somebody
who will take care of it.

552
00:42:40,121 --> 00:42:42,885
You think It is crime to
play hockey in this country?

553
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:51,387
No, no you can play politics,
cricket..

554
00:42:52,466 --> 00:42:53,933
you sure can play cricket!

555
00:42:55,836 --> 00:42:57,167
But hockey?

556
00:43:00,007 --> 00:43:01,133
It is a little difficult.

557
00:43:04,178 --> 00:43:06,043
Have you heard of
Mohammad bin Tuglaq?

558
00:43:06,847 --> 00:43:07,939
Is he cute?

559
00:43:08,983 --> 00:43:11,110
He was an emperor
- five hundred years ago.

560
00:43:12,153 --> 00:43:15,179
Crazy guy! Drove everyone mad.

561
00:43:16,857 --> 00:43:19,951
Stopped making gold and
silver coins for copper ones.

562
00:43:20,528 --> 00:43:22,052
Out in five years.

563
00:43:23,164 --> 00:43:25,189
That is how this
coach is going to go.

564
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,258
Thinks he can do anything.

565
00:43:27,868 --> 00:43:31,167
If you have such a sharp brain,
why do you not use when you play?

566
00:43:31,272 --> 00:43:35,003
He will be out in a few days.
The Association will kick him out.

567
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,036
The system does not work like this.

568
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,246
The name suits him
- Tuglaq.

569
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:51,517
Molly, Balbir,

570
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,152
Komal,

571
00:43:57,965 --> 00:43:59,023
Bindia, Aliya -

572
00:44:00,034 --> 00:44:01,296
You are benched.

573
00:44:08,175 --> 00:44:11,338
So till we do not play by his
rules he will not let us play.

574
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,379
Tuglaq has lost it.

575
00:44:16,217 --> 00:44:18,481
Alright. We are no less.

576
00:44:19,053 --> 00:44:20,452
We will now play
only at the tournament.

577
00:44:22,256 --> 00:44:23,985
Sir! Hey sir!

578
00:44:28,362 --> 00:44:31,957
Sir, I would like to play too.

579
00:44:36,237 --> 00:44:37,465
Ok, Ok.. I am really sorry.

580
00:44:42,309 --> 00:44:43,401
Sorry

581
00:44:45,946 --> 00:44:48,107
Hey, ok enough.. come on,
accept my apology

582
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:53,145
Accepting it, or should I hit you?

583
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,052
Sorry.

584
00:45:01,228 --> 00:45:04,197
Really sorry.

585
00:45:18,312 --> 00:45:19,973
Actually, she is not a bad player.

586
00:45:20,047 --> 00:45:22,607
When she whacks the ball hard,
it takes four girls to stop it.

587
00:45:22,983 --> 00:45:24,075
Admiring your enemy?

588
00:45:25,152 --> 00:45:26,278
Please do not pull my leg, didi.

589
00:45:26,353 --> 00:45:28,184
The coach has already
stopped us from playing.

590
00:45:28,255 --> 00:45:29,313
And then..

591
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:30,448
Oh man..

592
00:45:32,993 --> 00:45:34,085
Oh.. oh!

593
00:45:37,164 --> 00:45:38,290
Come didi, let us play..

594
00:45:38,365 --> 00:45:40,629
If we play, we will play in our
own positions. Shut up and sit down.

595
00:45:48,008 --> 00:45:49,236
God, look there is
bull chasing her..

596
00:45:51,312 --> 00:45:54,179
You've already scored your forty
two goals. I haven't even started.

597
00:45:56,383 --> 00:45:59,011
Sir let me also get a
pardon from the memsahib.

598
00:46:06,193 --> 00:46:07,251
Hey missy, do you want
to accept my apology?

599
00:46:07,328 --> 00:46:08,488
Or do you prefer going to the jail?
- What?

600
00:46:08,562 --> 00:46:11,258
Look, if you do not
pardon me, I will fight you..

601
00:46:11,365 --> 00:46:14,300
in the fight either I will smash
your head or you will smash mine

602
00:46:14,401 --> 00:46:16,028
and we will have to go to jail..

603
00:46:16,103 --> 00:46:18,162
Anyway.. so tell me do you accept my
apology or should we go to the police?

604
00:46:38,058 --> 00:46:39,320
Time is up. Come on!

605
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,391
Krishnaji, is anyone injured?

606
00:46:43,063 --> 00:46:44,291
Ok, now we will
reverse the play order.

607
00:46:44,365 --> 00:46:46,458
Defenders will attack
and attackers will defend.

608
00:46:47,134 --> 00:46:48,226
Sorry sir!

609
00:46:48,435 --> 00:46:51,268
Go attack! Ball on the centre.

610
00:46:53,707 --> 00:46:55,140
With all your heart! Come on!

611
00:47:13,427 --> 00:47:16,260
In the World Cup final,
the team lost to Pakistan.

612
00:47:17,298 --> 00:47:18,663
Wasn't he the team Captain?

613
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:20,623
Captain?

614
00:47:21,402 --> 00:47:24,166
He was Pakistan's captain,
in an lndian uniform.

615
00:47:25,105 --> 00:47:26,163
What are you saying?

616
00:47:26,373 --> 00:47:28,273
It is not only me. Everyone says so.

617
00:47:29,109 --> 00:47:30,474
So how did they make him the coach?

618
00:47:31,178 --> 00:47:33,237
This is lndia. Anything is possible.

619
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,405
He mentioned taking
us to the World Cup.

620
00:47:36,283 --> 00:47:38,308
He has already
sold his country once.

621
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,677
This time he may
just sell us as well!

622
00:47:45,426 --> 00:47:47,291
You guys will keep scrubbing
shoes for the rest of your life.

623
00:47:47,361 --> 00:47:49,158
Come, see who is downstairs.
- Who?

624
00:47:49,263 --> 00:47:50,389
Take a wild guess

625
00:47:51,131 --> 00:47:52,223
Is it a film star?

626
00:47:52,766 --> 00:47:54,324
Abhimanyu Singh!

627
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,432
You are kidding!

628
00:47:57,137 --> 00:47:58,195
What!

629
00:47:58,272 --> 00:48:01,400
Go see for yourself. Bro
is here to meet someone.

630
00:48:01,642 --> 00:48:02,700
He maybe your 'brother'!

631
00:48:03,143 --> 00:48:05,134
But who is he here for?
Come! Let us see!

632
00:48:05,212 --> 00:48:06,577
Let us go

633
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,367
She is a sly one.. did not
tell anyone she is his fianc?e..

634
00:48:29,803 --> 00:48:32,203
Coach has given her
leave till tomorrow morning..

635
00:48:32,306 --> 00:48:34,171
Wow!

636
00:48:43,484 --> 00:48:44,576
Leave till tomorrow morning.

637
00:48:45,552 --> 00:48:47,349
Why, whatever will
they do all night long?

638
00:48:54,528 --> 00:48:55,620
It is confirmed.

639
00:48:55,729 --> 00:48:57,253
They are making me the Vice Captain.

640
00:48:57,364 --> 00:48:58,490
Bullshit!

641
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,761
Really? I do not believe this!

642
00:49:05,272 --> 00:49:07,536
I knew it. How long will
these clowns hold out.

643
00:49:07,641 --> 00:49:09,700
Vice Captain of the
lndian frikkin cricket team!

644
00:49:09,843 --> 00:49:11,640
Now you watch how l
teach all these seniors.

645
00:49:12,312 --> 00:49:14,542
You see who rules this team now!

646
00:49:14,682 --> 00:49:17,845
Get out of the way everyone!
It is my turn now.

647
00:49:21,655 --> 00:49:23,213
Why do you not quit all this now?

648
00:49:24,224 --> 00:49:25,316
Quit what?

649
00:49:25,893 --> 00:49:27,485
Your silly stick & ball game

650
00:49:29,396 --> 00:49:32,763
Come on baby, forget about it now.

651
00:49:33,233 --> 00:49:34,291
Forget about it and do what?

652
00:49:34,368 --> 00:49:37,235
Do what? Live it up!

653
00:49:37,638 --> 00:49:39,731
Be with me! Travel
the world with me.

654
00:49:39,807 --> 00:49:41,832
Live life king-size, with the King.

655
00:49:42,676 --> 00:49:45,577
As the wife of the Vice
Captain of the lndian Cricket team!

656
00:49:45,646 --> 00:49:46,704
Wife?

657
00:49:47,414 --> 00:49:48,574
Oh, forgot to tell you.

658
00:49:50,884 --> 00:49:52,613
Had a chat with your dad
over drinks yesterday.

659
00:49:53,654 --> 00:49:55,281
I told him I am all for it.

660
00:49:55,355 --> 00:49:57,755
He said we do not want
to delay it anymore.

661
00:49:58,258 --> 00:49:59,657
So it is all fixed.

662
00:50:01,428 --> 00:50:02,725
Anyway, my career is all set.

663
00:50:02,796 --> 00:50:03,854
And what about my career?

664
00:50:04,264 --> 00:50:05,356
What?

665
00:50:05,432 --> 00:50:06,558
What about my career?

666
00:50:07,267 --> 00:50:09,633
What career?

667
00:50:09,703 --> 00:50:11,728
Abhi, I am in the lndian hockey team

668
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:15,275
Yeah but that is not a career,
Preeti. That is just a stupid game.

669
00:50:17,678 --> 00:50:18,770
So is cricket

670
00:50:18,912 --> 00:50:20,209
Preeti! I know you like to think of

671
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,908
your little dribbling and
stick work as a big thing.

672
00:50:23,283 --> 00:50:27,344
But let us face it
- it is not exactly cricket is it?

673
00:50:42,569 --> 00:50:44,400
Look at her enjoying herself!

674
00:50:46,673 --> 00:50:48,436
Damn it, let us go play.

675
00:50:51,311 --> 00:50:54,405
Come on, we have been rotting on
this same bench for the last 7 days.

676
00:50:54,515 --> 00:50:57,382
We are players, not
Association members who sit around.

677
00:50:57,484 --> 00:51:00,612
Come on. Come on!

678
00:51:05,759 --> 00:51:06,851
I will show him my game!

679
00:51:06,927 --> 00:51:08,258
If he is not forced to
make me a forward again,

680
00:51:08,328 --> 00:51:09,659
my name is not Bindia Naik.

681
00:51:10,631 --> 00:51:12,360
Or his is not Tuglaq.

682
00:51:19,907 --> 00:51:23,809
Sorry sir, it will not
happen again. We are sorry.

683
00:51:26,346 --> 00:51:27,438
Sorry

684
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:31,612
Ok, you can play center half.

685
00:51:41,693 --> 00:51:44,821
Thank God sir. The
situation is under control now.

686
00:51:45,964 --> 00:51:50,424
No, Krishnaji. It is just
about to go out of control.

687
00:51:52,404 --> 00:51:56,932
Right! Left! Right! Left!

688
00:51:57,842 --> 00:52:01,642
Faster! Faster! Faster!
Run faster! Move.

689
00:52:01,846 --> 00:52:03,473
Faster! Faster! Run faster!
I mean FAST!

690
00:52:04,883 --> 00:52:06,680
Right, left, right! To the ball!

691
00:52:06,751 --> 00:52:09,720
Ok, let's go! Right! Left!

692
00:52:10,855 --> 00:52:15,918
Pass the ball! Make a pass! Pass,
pass, pass, pass, pass, pass PASS!

693
00:52:15,994 --> 00:52:17,052
Thank you.

694
00:52:18,663 --> 00:52:22,599
Trap and pass! Move the
ball ahead! Come on, move it!

695
00:52:23,468 --> 00:52:25,732
No player will keep the
ball for more than 5 seconds.

696
00:52:25,804 --> 00:52:28,796
Can you count? 5-4-3-2-1!

697
00:52:30,508 --> 00:52:34,911
Faster! Faster! Run faster!
I mean FAST! Quick, quick!

698
00:52:34,979 --> 00:52:36,469
Faster, faster,

699
00:52:38,683 --> 00:52:41,811
What is your problem? Do you not see
the ball, or are you afraid of it?

700
00:52:41,886 --> 00:52:43,581
Want to practice with a
tennis ball for a few days?

701
00:52:46,724 --> 00:52:51,889
Left, right, left!
Leave the ball, sit!

702
00:52:52,097 --> 00:52:53,962
Go, right!

703
00:52:56,367 --> 00:52:57,425
Go to hell!

704
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:03,807
Trap, look and pass! Stop,
look and move it ahead..

705
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:05,968
Do not move yourself forward.
Move the ball forward!

706
00:53:06,444 --> 00:53:08,469
Do one thing pick up the ball.

707
00:53:09,614 --> 00:53:13,983
PlCK lT UP! Put it in
your pocket and go home.

708
00:53:14,586 --> 00:53:17,384
Go play on the Chandigarh team
from tomorrow. No need to play here.

709
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:24,785
And you! What are
you so angry about?

710
00:53:25,463 --> 00:53:26,794
Raise your game first

711
00:53:26,865 --> 00:53:27,923
and then raise your voice.

712
00:53:27,999 --> 00:53:30,695
Once more if I hear you shout out,

713
00:53:31,035 --> 00:53:32,400
you will be out!

714
00:53:40,645 --> 00:53:43,443
Hey you! Why are
you the center half?

715
00:53:43,848 --> 00:53:45,782
Because you are the senior
most player in the team.

716
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:48,978
Your job is not to push the
forward line but to teach them.

717
00:53:50,155 --> 00:53:51,554
And one more thing.

718
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:55,452
There can only be one
bully in every team.

719
00:53:56,427 --> 00:53:59,055
And for this team, it is me.

720
00:54:06,004 --> 00:54:07,904
You! Call this a pass?

721
00:54:09,607 --> 00:54:11,507
You are only good enough to
plough fields in your village.

722
00:54:11,576 --> 00:54:12,804
Forget about hockey!

723
00:54:14,445 --> 00:54:16,470
And why are you standing around?
Go get the ball!

724
00:54:19,184 --> 00:54:22,551
Right, left, right,

725
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:27,819
Ieft, right, left! Relax!

726
00:54:28,092 --> 00:54:29,150
Nethra!

727
00:54:33,464 --> 00:54:36,991
Krishnaji! Give her water
and take her out! Quickly!

728
00:54:41,973 --> 00:54:46,103
So! You are lndia's best players!

729
00:54:47,078 --> 00:54:49,205
You will go to the
World Championship! Hah!

730
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,145
To raise lndia's flag!

731
00:54:52,016 --> 00:54:55,713
The Association is right.

732
00:54:56,054 --> 00:54:58,716
How will this lot ever play hockey!

733
00:54:59,924 --> 00:55:01,482
They cannot play as
one team. How the hell..

734
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:02,617
..will they ever win
a World Championship!

735
00:55:03,094 --> 00:55:05,858
What are you staring at?
She is unconscious not dead!

736
00:55:06,731 --> 00:55:08,494
Krishnaji! Take her away! Out!

737
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:13,864
I had said it on the first day.

738
00:55:14,772 --> 00:55:19,869
This team needs only those
who first play for lndia,

739
00:55:20,111 --> 00:55:23,012
then for their team mates

740
00:55:23,248 --> 00:55:27,207
and then if there is any
life left, for themselves.

741
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,248
Let's start again.

742
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:33,748
Right!

743
00:56:10,795 --> 00:56:13,025
So! Did you see what happens when
you let the coach think he is God!

744
00:56:16,768 --> 00:56:18,099
The blood will not stop.

745
00:56:19,704 --> 00:56:21,171
I warned you guys.

746
00:56:25,977 --> 00:56:27,035
Do you want to eat something?

747
00:56:30,014 --> 00:56:34,951
Wake up at 4am, run for 20 km. And
on the field, he does not let us play.

748
00:56:35,853 --> 00:56:36,911
What kind of a camp is this?

749
00:56:36,988 --> 00:56:38,046
Does it hurt a lot?

750
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:40,682
Here! It hurts here.

751
00:56:41,826 --> 00:56:43,225
He insulted us!

752
00:56:44,262 --> 00:56:45,320
Hit with the ball!

753
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:48,630
He knows damn well you
cannot speak English.

754
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,962
But you have to learn it!

755
00:56:50,034 --> 00:56:52,332
What you have not learnt in your
whole life, learn it in a day!

756
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:53,828
Else get out of the team.

757
00:56:53,905 --> 00:56:55,133
Hey, he cannot throw you out!

758
00:56:55,239 --> 00:56:59,198
Do not worry, I will teach you.

759
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:01,110
How can he cut you out of the team?

760
00:57:01,179 --> 00:57:03,170
What do you say Aliya?

761
00:57:03,881 --> 00:57:08,614
No freedom to eat, to move around
and when we play, he insults us.

762
00:57:09,987 --> 00:57:13,855
This is not a primary school. Each
girl is a National level player.

763
00:57:13,925 --> 00:57:16,291
A champion from her state
- that is why she is here.

764
00:57:16,794 --> 00:57:18,989
If there is any failure
amongst us, It is him.

765
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:21,120
Sold his team out in the World Cup!

766
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:23,291
Was thrown out of
the team, the country.

767
00:57:25,203 --> 00:57:27,194
What else can I say? I am
ashamed to say any more.

768
00:57:28,773 --> 00:57:29,899
Does it hurt?

769
00:57:32,977 --> 00:57:34,376
I have a spray..

770
00:57:40,184 --> 00:57:41,276
How is Nethra?

771
00:57:42,153 --> 00:57:46,180
OK. The doctor says she will be
back to practice in a couple of days.

772
00:57:47,692 --> 00:57:50,718
Practice? Have you lost it?

773
00:57:51,963 --> 00:57:53,294
From now on, there
will be no practice!

774
00:57:54,065 --> 00:57:56,329
There will be no
practice from tomorrow!

775
00:57:56,901 --> 00:57:57,959
Look here..

776
00:57:58,035 --> 00:58:04,406
You look here! We know you like him

777
00:58:04,909 --> 00:58:09,039
but you should also realise
that the team is on this side.

778
00:58:13,785 --> 00:58:15,844
It is time you choose
which side you're on.

779
00:58:16,788 --> 00:58:17,846
Yes.

780
00:58:18,923 --> 00:58:19,981
Definitely.

781
00:58:23,094 --> 00:58:24,254
I have thought about it.

782
00:58:25,196 --> 00:58:29,189
Now only the Association can
decide how this team should run.

783
00:58:30,067 --> 00:58:32,194
The way teams have
always run in this country.

784
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:35,200
Or the way Tuglaq wants it!

785
00:58:43,448 --> 00:58:46,315
Let us sign this.

786
00:58:48,886 --> 00:58:53,721
Now, it is either
the Coach or our team.

787
00:58:56,227 --> 00:58:57,319
Sign this, Gul!

788
00:59:20,818 --> 00:59:21,876
Sir..

789
00:59:23,054 --> 00:59:25,022
Hmmm? Have some..

790
00:59:27,158 --> 00:59:28,420
Wasn't that too much?

791
00:59:31,762 --> 00:59:34,856
They are girls after all.
How much can you push them?

792
00:59:35,867 --> 00:59:37,767
If you look for the
strength of boys..

793
00:59:37,835 --> 00:59:40,303
I am not looking for strength.
I am looking for team spirit.

794
00:59:41,506 --> 00:59:44,134
You do not need strength to make
a team. You need team spirit.

795
00:59:45,776 --> 00:59:49,405
But sir, at this rate, you
will become their enemy.

796
00:59:49,947 --> 00:59:53,781
If by making me an enemy
they can become a team,

797
00:59:54,785 --> 00:59:57,049
then it is a small
price to pay, Krishnaji.

798
01:00:14,071 --> 01:00:15,402
Why are you not on the field?

799
01:00:17,808 --> 01:00:18,866
What is the matter?

800
01:00:20,912 --> 01:00:22,937
The team does not want
to practice with you.

801
01:00:23,347 --> 01:00:24,974
What rubbish!

802
01:00:27,818 --> 01:00:29,376
We want a new coach.

803
01:00:29,987 --> 01:00:31,386
I will give you one -

804
01:00:31,455 --> 01:00:34,185
Why Krishnaji? Why will you hit us?

805
01:00:34,825 --> 01:00:36,224
We are not the ones
who sold our country!

806
01:00:36,427 --> 01:00:37,951
Quiet!
- Sir!

807
01:00:47,438 --> 01:00:48,496
7 years.

808
01:00:50,341 --> 01:00:53,333
After 7 years I came back to hockey,
with the belief that this time

809
01:00:54,111 --> 01:00:58,946
I will beat the one thing that
defeated my team once and for all.

810
01:01:01,218 --> 01:01:04,847
But today, once again,
I have lost to it.

811
01:01:07,525 --> 01:01:10,460
You do not have a problem with me.

812
01:01:12,129 --> 01:01:13,926
You have a problem

813
01:01:15,266 --> 01:01:16,995
with the fact that instead of
making you play against each other,

814
01:01:17,068 --> 01:01:19,127
I am forcing you to
play with one another.

815
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:20,996
Because I have forced
you to think about..

816
01:01:21,072 --> 01:01:22,903
..your team before you
think about yourself.

817
01:01:23,307 --> 01:01:26,868
Forced you to play for lndia
before you play for your own state.

818
01:01:30,114 --> 01:01:38,544
Fine. You have won. I have lost.

819
01:01:42,326 --> 01:01:45,386
But I am not sorry loosing to you.

820
01:01:46,364 --> 01:01:52,132
I am sorry I have
lost to my country.

821
01:01:53,904 --> 01:01:57,897
Which even after taking my blood,
sweat, my love,..

822
01:01:57,975 --> 01:02:02,571
..my life, does not believe
that I played for it once.

823
01:02:03,447 --> 01:02:06,382
And I will play for it all my life.

824
01:02:11,122 --> 01:02:14,285
I resign as the coach of this team.

825
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,170
Please, just think it over, Sir.

826
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:21,381
You have worked so hard.

827
01:03:44,081 --> 01:03:46,515
Today is my last day in this camp.

828
01:03:49,153 --> 01:03:52,145
Before I leave, I am
taking the staff out for lunch.

829
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:55,654
You are welcome to
join us if you wish.

830
01:03:59,597 --> 01:04:02,225
No obligations.

831
01:05:11,335 --> 01:05:15,431
Hi beautiful! Come on,
join us babes! Hey come on!

832
01:05:19,143 --> 01:05:23,273
She's red hot ya! Hey baby, hey!

833
01:05:29,286 --> 01:05:31,186
Harassing girls, are you? Try it!

834
01:05:31,255 --> 01:05:33,246
Hey! Hey, how..

835
01:05:34,225 --> 01:05:35,283
Balbir!

836
01:05:39,163 --> 01:05:41,495
Hit him!

837
01:06:45,729 --> 01:06:46,787
Do not let him go!

838
01:07:08,919 --> 01:07:11,717
Not from behind. Have guts
to attack from the front.

839
01:07:13,457 --> 01:07:17,757
You see, in hockey
there are no cowards.

840
01:07:43,887 --> 01:07:45,821
Is this a team or an army of devils?

841
01:07:47,524 --> 01:07:49,321
I told you, Krishnaji.

842
01:07:49,393 --> 01:07:53,489
It is not strength, but
spirit that makes a team.

843
01:07:55,366 --> 01:07:58,631
For the first time, l
have seen team spirit.

844
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:38,399
Sir.. I was just..
just trying to say that..

845
01:08:39,843 --> 01:08:45,748
I mean.. Iet
sleeping dogs lie.. I mean..

846
01:08:46,784 --> 01:08:47,944
Hey tell him!

847
01:08:49,019 --> 01:08:53,854
Sir what she means.. what we all

848
01:09:07,871 --> 01:09:09,395
Tomorrow morning, 5 am sharp.

849
01:09:10,808 --> 01:09:14,437
I want everyone on the field.

850
01:09:19,683 --> 01:09:28,716
Chak De! India (Go lndia!)

851
01:09:50,746 --> 01:09:56,810
Y

852
01:09:57,086 --> 01:09:58,144
Come, come, come.

853
01:09:58,754 --> 01:10:01,188
We will run two
more kilometers today.

854
01:10:01,257 --> 01:10:02,315
Come on guys!

855
01:10:16,672 --> 01:10:18,663
Do something, do something

856
01:10:18,741 --> 01:10:21,005
My veins are bursting

857
01:10:21,077 --> 01:10:22,305
O please do something

858
01:10:25,614 --> 01:10:27,775
Do something, do something

859
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:30,114
For talk and sermons bite the dust

860
01:10:30,186 --> 01:10:31,778
It is time to do something

861
01:10:34,323 --> 01:10:36,291
Be stubborn if that is what it takes

862
01:10:36,358 --> 01:10:38,792
Do or die
- all is at stake!

863
01:10:44,166 --> 01:10:48,762
Chak De! India (Go lndia!)

864
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:16,154
In the fighting kite,
in the riot of might

865
01:11:16,232 --> 01:11:20,726
In the games and the fair,
in the bumpy trains so bare

866
01:11:20,803 --> 01:11:25,672
In the sweetness of sugarcane,
in the clothes of the rich or vain

867
01:11:25,741 --> 01:11:29,905
Seek and you will find,
heat that bricks bind

868
01:11:29,979 --> 01:11:34,040
A colour has emerged, and
it is spreading converged

869
01:11:34,116 --> 01:11:38,849
This colour of the reign,
is embedded in your veins

870
01:11:38,921 --> 01:11:43,290
Stand immovable, invincible,
obstinate in times of trouble

871
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:51,733
Scraped and scarred,
move on even if marred

872
01:11:51,801 --> 01:11:54,133
Be stubborn if that is what it takes

873
01:11:54,203 --> 01:11:56,330
Do or die
- all is at stake!

874
01:12:02,144 --> 01:12:06,240
Chak De! India (Go lndia!)

875
01:12:29,939 --> 01:12:30,997
How can you go?

876
01:12:31,073 --> 01:12:32,131
Why?

877
01:12:32,741 --> 01:12:33,969
Because we are getting married!

878
01:12:34,076 --> 01:12:35,134
What?

879
01:12:35,311 --> 01:12:38,109
You can not go on the 25th, we
are getting married on the 2nd

880
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:39,238
What?

881
01:12:39,315 --> 01:12:40,976
I have fixed the dates after
discussing it with your parents

882
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:42,745
And me? Do you not need
to discuss this with me?

883
01:12:42,818 --> 01:12:43,910
What is the point of discussing it?

884
01:12:43,986 --> 01:12:45,453
You want to get
married to me, do you not?

885
01:12:46,789 --> 01:12:49,019
But, not like this! I need time.

886
01:12:49,091 --> 01:12:50,183
What for?

887
01:12:50,259 --> 01:12:51,749
I am playing for
the World Cup, Abhi!

888
01:12:51,827 --> 01:12:53,761
Have you gone insane?

889
01:12:54,063 --> 01:12:56,224
You want to postpone our
wedding for the World Cup?

890
01:12:57,132 --> 01:12:58,997
What if it was your World cup?

891
01:12:59,068 --> 01:13:00,330
That is a totally different.

892
01:13:00,402 --> 01:13:01,892
It is the Cricket World cup.

893
01:13:01,971 --> 01:13:03,063
It is really important.

894
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,299
This is really important.. for me

895
01:13:06,375 --> 01:13:07,933
More important than our marriage?

896
01:13:08,944 --> 01:13:10,275
I have to go. Good night!

897
01:13:12,481 --> 01:13:14,949
Go. Go play the World cup..

898
01:13:15,017 --> 01:13:17,417
If you loose you
will become my wife.

899
01:13:17,887 --> 01:13:20,515
If you win, you
will become my wife..

900
01:13:21,257 --> 01:13:22,781
It is not like when you come back,

901
01:13:22,858 --> 01:13:26,350
the whole country
will remember your name.

902
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,958
One thing I promise
you Mr. Abhimanyu..

903
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,493
This will definitely happen.

904
01:13:38,407 --> 01:13:40,102
The team is shaping up well, sir.

905
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:42,236
The captain of this
team will be Vidya.

906
01:13:45,314 --> 01:13:46,508
Congratulations, Vidya!

907
01:13:58,994 --> 01:14:00,120
Give it a break.

908
01:14:00,429 --> 01:14:01,919
I have nothing to say to you.

909
01:14:02,231 --> 01:14:04,825
For the first time something
good is happening. Take part in it.

910
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:05,958
You already did!

911
01:14:10,005 --> 01:14:11,905
The way Bindia is using her brain..

912
01:14:12,374 --> 01:14:14,399
Do you think it is right
for her to be on the team?

913
01:14:15,477 --> 01:14:17,843
I do not know Krishnaji..
but it is also not right..

914
01:14:17,913 --> 01:14:21,041
..to keep the most
experienced player off the team.

915
01:14:21,917 --> 01:14:24,249
I do not think we can..
deal with her

916
01:14:26,355 --> 01:14:29,290
We cannot win without her either.

917
01:14:31,193 --> 01:14:33,889
Is this not your
World Cup silver medal?

918
01:14:35,431 --> 01:14:36,489
What are you doing with it?

919
01:14:38,567 --> 01:14:41,001
Trying to scrub it into gold.

920
01:14:43,038 --> 01:14:45,268
If I ever need to sell
it in the flea market,

921
01:14:46,275 --> 01:14:47,469
at least I will get a good price.

922
01:14:53,148 --> 01:14:58,609
Mr. Kabir, it is best if you
forget about the World Cup.

923
01:14:59,888 --> 01:15:01,446
And tell these girls as well.

924
01:15:01,523 --> 01:15:03,252
The ones who you have
given such high hopes too.

925
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:07,395
But our deal was to train
this team for the World Cup.

926
01:15:08,564 --> 01:15:12,364
It was not like we signed on a legal
document you cannot hold us up to it.

927
01:15:12,501 --> 01:15:14,594
You discussed it in
front of me, Mr. Tripathi.

928
01:15:15,337 --> 01:15:17,328
We will discuss it in
front of you once more.

929
01:15:18,073 --> 01:15:20,200
Look, on one hand,

930
01:15:20,275 --> 01:15:24,041
there is the lndian men's team
which at least gets a bronze medal.

931
01:15:24,546 --> 01:15:27,037
And on the other, there
is this team of misfits.

932
01:15:27,449 --> 01:15:30,612
But this team is
ready for the World Cup!

933
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:34,121
Tomorrow if they are ready for
the moon, we should send them? Huh?

934
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:36,153
This team can not go the World Cup.

935
01:15:36,225 --> 01:15:37,283
It is decided.

936
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,928
Be honest. Tell us
you are taking money..

937
01:15:39,995 --> 01:15:42,520
..from the Women's team
to give to the Men's team.

938
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:45,364
You guys are athletes.

939
01:15:46,135 --> 01:15:49,161
Why do you want to get involved
in things that do not concern you?

940
01:15:50,272 --> 01:15:51,330
Shall we?

941
01:15:52,241 --> 01:15:53,299
But Mr. Tripathi!

942
01:15:54,943 --> 01:15:57,639
Let us have a match.

943
01:15:57,713 --> 01:15:58,941
What?

944
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:06,014
Yes. Let us have a match.
Between my team and your team.

945
01:16:07,089 --> 01:16:09,956
You mean Men's
team v/s Women's team?

946
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:14,154
I mean between my
team and your team.

947
01:16:17,099 --> 01:16:21,058
If we loose, we loose. But
if we win, then - World Cup.

948
01:16:24,139 --> 01:16:25,606
Think about what you
are saying, Mr. Kabir.

949
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:29,075
Do not make Pandavas' (lndian
mythological characters) bet

950
01:16:29,378 --> 01:16:31,175
You will be left standing naked.

951
01:16:31,246 --> 01:16:33,271
It has already happened to you once.

952
01:16:36,285 --> 01:16:39,186
All right. Day after morning.

953
01:16:40,189 --> 01:16:42,419
But we need time to train!

954
01:16:42,491 --> 01:16:45,187
Day after
- yes or no?

955
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:46,318
Mr. Tripathi..

956
01:16:46,395 --> 01:16:48,260
Day after morning. We
will meet on the field.

957
01:16:54,403 --> 01:16:56,428
Even your team needs to practice

958
01:16:56,505 --> 01:16:57,563
Come out..

959
01:17:09,384 --> 01:17:10,442
Shit!

960
01:17:11,353 --> 01:17:14,322
We will never win. And
by some chance, if we do..

961
01:17:14,389 --> 01:17:17,586
Chance! Huh!

962
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:21,026
Imagine how many
goals we will loose by.

963
01:17:21,096 --> 01:17:24,065
And once we lose,
it is over forever!

964
01:17:29,538 --> 01:17:30,766
What have you done, sir?

965
01:17:30,839 --> 01:17:32,534
We are like sitting ducks.

966
01:17:32,608 --> 01:17:37,568
Ducks? I have belief in this team.

967
01:17:38,247 --> 01:17:40,044
Does this team believe in itself?

968
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,081
Come on! Let us go.

969
01:17:46,688 --> 01:17:52,149
Look, you are not
playing against these boys.

970
01:17:52,227 --> 01:17:54,092
Come on, get ready! Hurry!

971
01:17:56,732 --> 01:17:58,290
Do not think
- here let me have it.

972
01:17:59,268 --> 01:18:02,726
Do not think you are
playing against 1 6 boys.

973
01:18:05,407 --> 01:18:08,501
You are fighting
everyone in this country

974
01:18:09,211 --> 01:18:12,237
who thinks girls can
never match up to men,

975
01:18:13,782 --> 01:18:16,410
cannot hold a job as well as a man,

976
01:18:17,085 --> 01:18:19,485
cannot make decisions like men..

977
01:18:21,523 --> 01:18:25,391
You are fighting each
fool who has forgotten that

978
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:27,758
if a girl has given life to him,

979
01:18:28,697 --> 01:18:32,793
she can do anything. Anything.

980
01:18:36,572 --> 01:18:39,564
It is a huge match
perhaps bigger than you or me.

981
01:18:40,609 --> 01:18:44,340
And that is why I should be
telling you play fearlessly,

982
01:18:44,713 --> 01:18:50,709
play together, play
with all your might,

983
01:18:50,786 --> 01:18:52,378
play like this, play like that..

984
01:18:52,454 --> 01:18:57,118
but I will just say one thing

985
01:19:02,397 --> 01:19:03,455
Chak De!

986
01:19:26,655 --> 01:19:27,713
Do they know how to play?

987
01:19:27,789 --> 01:19:29,484
Good morning, ladies & gentlemen!

988
01:19:29,558 --> 01:19:30,616
Good morning sir!

989
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:09,217
But sir! That was a foul!

990
01:20:46,998 --> 01:20:48,761
Very good! Well played!

991
01:21:20,398 --> 01:21:22,025
Good job boys!

992
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:24,728
Come on! Come on girls! Well played!

993
01:21:33,945 --> 01:21:37,073
Don't tire yourselves running!
Smaller passes!

994
01:21:37,148 --> 01:21:38,672
Should we stop if
you have had enough,..

995
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:41,014
..Mr. Kabir? Or do
you still want to play?

996
01:21:41,086 --> 01:21:42,144
The match isn't over yet.

997
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:45,255
Your girls could not
even reach the boys' half.

998
01:21:45,323 --> 01:21:46,381
You cannot expect
anything from them.

999
01:21:46,458 --> 01:21:47,686
Mr. Yadav what..

1000
01:21:49,127 --> 01:21:50,685
Well, he's right Krishnaji.

1001
01:21:51,096 --> 01:21:54,122
We always said it - These are
good old fashioned lndian girls -

1002
01:21:54,199 --> 01:21:57,327
How will they run around
in shorts and mini - skirts?

1003
01:21:57,402 --> 01:21:58,869
Yes, Mr. Yadav,
tell them like it is.

1004
01:21:58,937 --> 01:22:02,202
What can you do? You will fall
flat on your faces, you'll see!

1
00:00:00,401 --> 00:00:03,234
Oh, Mr. Yadav! You have fallen!
Will you get up by yourself?

2
00:00:03,304 --> 00:00:04,362
Or should I ask the
girls to give you a hand?

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,269
Oye!

4
00:00:07,342 --> 00:00:09,242
Chak De!

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,942
Attack, girls!

6
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:24,516
Yes!

7
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:24,871
Go Komal!

8
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:18,124
They played well! Good defence!

9
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,963
Good job! Well played girls!

10
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:51,486
Should we (send them) sir?

11
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:53,686
Send? Where? Oh, this?

12
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,098
Yes.. send them

13
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:07,733
Yes! Kabir! World Championship!

14
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:21,513
Y

15
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:44,210
When could I imagined
that this would happen

16
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:49,239
When did I ever believe, but
it has, it has indeed happened

17
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:53,949
Pinch me, I am not in my senses

18
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:58,788
Hold my feet, they
are soaring in the air

19
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:04,654
Are my feet on the clouds,
or is this a land of illusion

20
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:09,260
Now it has taken off,
our boat has taken sail

21
00:06:55,616 --> 00:07:04,354
It is the taste of
the sky, after eons

22
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:08,823
My trembling heart beats hard,
is it day or night?

23
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:14,129
You have finally been magnanimous,
God! Thank you!

24
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,068
Are my feet on the clouds,
or is this a land of illusion

25
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:25,010
Now it has taken off,
our boat has taken sail

26
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:19,924
The mates have embarked,
the paths are unknown

27
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,198
But we can do it, l
know there's a way

28
00:08:24,305 --> 00:08:29,368
The dreams we saw blindfolded,
we live today

29
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:35,372
Are my feet on the clouds,
or is this a land of illusion

30
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:40,443
Now it has taken off,
our boat has taken sail

31
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:59,435
Greetings from Kapil Verma!

32
00:08:59,507 --> 00:09:03,136
Welcome to Melbourne's State
Hockey and Netball Centre!

33
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:05,905
In the World Women's
Hockey Championship,

34
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,110
today lndia are playing 6
times World Champions Australia.

35
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:12,875
The teams are greeting each other -

36
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:17,786
Australia exudes the
confidence of World Champions..

37
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,868
The teams pay their
respects to their flags..

38
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:36,942
A deep sense of pride in the eyes
of Coach Kabir Khan and his team..

39
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,077
Excitement in the stands..

40
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,080
Teams are raring to go
and the match begins!

41
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:52,818
Australia has the ball.. Back pass!

42
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:55,293
A long scoop, straight
to lndia's 25 yard line..

43
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:59,025
Left the lndian defenders behind..
cross pass.. and GOAL!

44
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:06,302
And perhaps the fastest goal in the
history of the World Championship!

45
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:14,847
From the very first minute,
there's pressure on the lndian team..

46
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,883
It is alright!
Lots of time. Come on!

47
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:20,546
Coach Kabir trying
to bolster his team..

48
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:26,082
but one more strong attack
from Australia and goal!

49
00:10:29,497 --> 00:10:30,555
Goal!

50
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:41,004
The witches kick! Hey,
that's not fair! Anyway..

51
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:43,904
India, Australia's goal.

52
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:46,310
Hey! That big moose kicked me hard,
did you not see that?

53
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,075
India, careful!

54
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,013
Balbir! Don't argue! Just play

55
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:52,314
Go get your eyes checked!
You need glasses!

56
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:53,444
Be careful! Australia's ball.

57
00:10:56,524 --> 00:10:57,582
I'll show you!

58
00:11:02,363 --> 00:11:04,160
Hey, that's completely wrong!
Totally unfair!

59
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:06,157
What is she saying?

60
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,531
Go back to your goal. - How go back to
your goal! Wrong decision is there!

61
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:10,092
Calm down!
- Wrong! Wrong!

62
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,967
Sir, what is she doing?
She will get a card!

63
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:17,174
If you open your mouth one more time,
you will be off. Go back to your goal!

64
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:18,871
You go back, you idiot!

65
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:23,515
A yellow card and the
way out for Balbir..

66
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:28,021
and a penalty corner for Australia..
could be dangerous for lndia

67
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:34,394
What a pig headed referee?

68
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:37,396
Is she a pig headed idiot or are
you? We are left with ten players now!

69
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:39,022
Krishnaji, give her water..

70
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:53,908
And penalty corner specialist Abernathy
has been waiting for this moment.

71
00:11:57,084 --> 00:12:01,282
Push, trap, hit and goal!

72
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,573
A last ditch attempt to save
the match by Coach Kabir Khan..

73
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:30,314
Didi, where should I hit it?

74
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:31,442
Any where you please

75
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:34,210
Didi, please!

76
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:38,324
Don't ask me. Go ask your captain?

77
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:42,123
Seems a move is made between
senior Bindia Naik and Soimoi but..

78
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:50,133
some confusion between the players..
and once more Australia scores

79
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:56,136
And in the second half, Australia
- 5, lndia - 0

80
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:01,275
Indian centre forward
Preeti Sabarwal on attack..

81
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:02,975
with her is Right in Komal
Chautala.. - Preeti! Pass!

82
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,711
both playing the World
Championship for the first time..

83
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,151
proving a challenge for Australia..

84
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:11,123
Preeti's off! Dodges one defender,
another one..

85
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,352
keeping the ball for so long..

86
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:15,520
Komal's ready.. but Preeti..
doesn't pass..

87
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:34,079
Komal pass!

88
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,114
What are you doing, Komal! Pass!

89
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:41,348
Pass Komal! No one on this side!

90
00:13:46,694 --> 00:13:49,026
A precious
opportunity lost because of..

91
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:51,326
..the lack of coordination
between the lndian forwards..

92
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:54,661
And the old lndian
attitude strikes again!

93
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,265
Good save, good save!

94
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,067
Yeah?
- They are playing defense.

95
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,573
Get the Coach to use
the Dutch tactic..

96
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:20,694
Ho! Ho!

97
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:24,788
A minor confusion.. Looks like Soimoi
does not understand the referee..

98
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:29,725
And one more penalty
corner for Australia.

99
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:52,251
Match over! Australia - 7, lndia -
0. A shameful defeat for lndia..

100
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,117
Well played! - How did you ever
make it to the World Championship?

101
00:15:55,823 --> 00:15:56,881
Bindia!

102
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:02,158
Bindia.. What were you up to?

103
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,159
Me? Where?

104
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:05,289
What were you doing on the field?

105
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,224
Nothing

106
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:10,369
You are not going to play
any more in this Championship!

107
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:13,600
What's so special about her?

108
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:20,404
What?

109
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:24,546
Tell me, what does
she have that I don't?

110
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:25,910
Who?

111
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:28,882
Your captain, Sir.

112
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:36,828
If we have to get down to it,
why don't we just spell it out?

113
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:45,399
Neither of us is naive here
- neither you, nor me..

114
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:51,410
I can do all that she is
doing to be a captain..

115
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:56,674
And much more..

116
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,747
Now tell me, why
can I not be captain?

117
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,233
You have just
answered your question.

118
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:56,703
A team that is not fit to play
against European high schools.

119
00:17:56,877 --> 00:18:01,905
And you wish to redeem your
name by coaching such a team.

120
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:15,419
..Association denounced Kabir Khan
- declared he did his country wrong.

121
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:18,658
These kind of people should have moved
to Pakistan during the partition.

122
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:19,926
Someone has sold out?

123
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,664
Papa, papa, I want to see
what a traitor looks like.

124
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:27,764
Down with Kabir Khan!

125
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:36,772
Allah.. bring me strength
and bring victory closer

126
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:57,600
..it is almost certain that lndia
will be out of the Championship.

127
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:02,766
There is one chance of survival -
defeating England in tomorrow's match.

128
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:07,635
But looking at lndia's
form it is highly unlikely.

129
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:12,877
Very good! Pass to Aliya!

130
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,346
Come here! Come here everyone! OK!

131
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,553
Now we are making the
same mistakes again. Water..

132
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:23,154
So, set piece A6
- From Balbir to Rani,..

133
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:26,561
..Rani to Molly, Molly
to Gul, Gul to Preeti,

134
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,156
Preeti to Komal, from
Komal back to Preeti,..

135
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,723
..from Preeti to Komal
again and Komal to goal..

136
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,359
Set-piece A6
- does everyone remember?

137
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,336
Yes sir!
- Good! Repeat it!

138
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:36,499
Preeti to Komal, Komal to Preeti,
from Preeti to Gul to Komal.. uh..

139
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,872
That's B6

140
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,734
I will beat the crap out of
anyone who cannot remember.

141
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,177
Balbir..If you do not
control your temper,..

142
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,339
..the situation can
get out of control. OK?

143
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,241
Yes sir. - If it becomes a team
of ten again, there is no hope.

144
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,684
Is there anything left, now?
- Plenty..

145
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,187
Ok, let's begin all
over again. Everybody!..

146
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,348
..20 minutes more!
Concentrate on defense! Go!

147
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,750
Full power! Play
with all you've got!

148
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:16,213
Greetings and welcome to
the World Championship..

149
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,772
..in Melbourne where England is
playing in Group A for 2 points,

150
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,616
but lndia is fighting to
stay in the Championship.

151
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:29,728
Good! Let's go!

152
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,295
The UK Coach has promised to
beat lndia by..

153
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,298
..even more goals than Australia.

154
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:39,463
Maybe that is why there are
not too many spectators around.

155
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,677
UK has gone on the attack immediately
lndian players struggling..

156
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,380
Half press forward!

157
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:01,418
Komal Chautala blocks..

158
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:02,653
Great job Komal!

159
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,999
Balbir, Soimoi! No6

160
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,979
Today lndia seem to
have better coordination..

161
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,517
..but the UK
forwards attack once more -

162
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:31,880
And lndia saves!
- Yes! Good!

163
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:39,454
Hey!

164
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,589
Foul!

165
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,695
Balbir!

166
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:49,364
Keep calm!

167
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:55,507
I got hurt here! Ok, fine,
guess it's a part of the game

168
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,740
That's rubbish!

169
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,043
Good Balbir!

170
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:00,749
Thank God, she didn't hit her!

171
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:07,324
20 minutes left in the first half
- England gets a..

172
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:10,987
..penalty corner.. could
be dangerous for lndia.

173
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,892
Go!

174
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,613
And lndia has made no mistakes.

175
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,407
I am confused. Which
one of them is Didi?

176
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,856
Chak De!

177
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,490
Second half
- lndia has not given up any goals.

178
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,623
But hasn't scored any either.

179
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,667
Preeti come on! Fall back!
On the double!

180
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,819
Save!

181
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,891
Well done! Well done Gunjan!

182
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:32,705
Last 3 minutes of the match..
both teams goalless.

183
00:23:32,777 --> 00:23:35,746
England is trying hard to score..

184
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:42,784
But lndian defender Soimoi has the
ball.. Soimoi to Mary.. to Preeti.

185
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,821
Pick it up! Pick it up!

186
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:54,556
Preeti I'm free! Pass!

187
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,498
Pass Preeti..

188
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,917
And goal! Unbelievable!!!

189
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:25,462
Wow! What a goal, Sir!
She made the British..

190
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,930
..forget their English!
Great job Preeti!

191
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:31,799
Jesus! Bloody hell!
What was she doing?

192
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,180
Last 20 seconds of the match..

193
00:24:56,561 --> 00:25:00,497
And with this final hooter,
the unexpected has happened!..

194
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:04,763
..India has defeated UK by 1-0

195
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:12,174
Managing to stay in the Championship..
and get a new lease of life!

196
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,574
Well played!
- Congratulations!

197
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,518
Well played! Well done!
It's a good thing..

198
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:24,248
..you controlled
your temper, Balbir!

199
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,791
Let's go girls! Come on!

200
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,534
The future may be
unclear but for now,..

201
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:40,230
..India has retained itself
in the World Championship.

202
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,176
India v/s Spain!

203
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,707
Do something, do something

204
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,944
My veins are bursting

205
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,281
O please do something

206
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,015
A superb goal by Komal Chautala!

207
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,819
Do something, do something

208
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,554
For talks and sermons bite the dust

209
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:04,720
It is time to do something

210
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:09,262
Be stubborn if that is what it takes

211
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:14,003
Do or die, all is at stake

212
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:18,166
Chak De!

213
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,212
Chak de! Ho Chak
de lndia!(Go lndia!)

214
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,308
Keep it up!

215
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,980
Didi, can I get some water?

216
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,677
Shall I give you a kick instead?

217
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:07,124
Give the battle cry of war
and give it again and again..

218
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,626
Don't lag behind in
the race, my friend,

219
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:11,685
Iet them pull you
back as much as they can

220
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:16,132
Won't budge an inch. Bull headed,
you think? Yes I am!

221
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:20,968
The scraping, the squeazing,
grating of life, be done with it!

222
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:26,909
Preeti has sprinted ahead. Buck up
Komal, Get even in the next match.

223
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,708
Do or die, all is at stake

224
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:34,384
Chak de! Ho Chak
de lndia!(Go lndia!)

225
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,722
Surprising everyone
with its sudden rise,

226
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:46,662
Kabir Khan's team is
playing a match that..

227
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:50,064
..may stop it in
its tracks tomorrow.

228
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:56,005
If lndia wins, It enters
the semi finals and if..

229
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:59,373
..it loses, it is
out of the World Cup.

230
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:03,680
Tomorrow lndia plays Argentina,
a team well known..

231
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:08,242
..for its rough play
and injuring opponents.

232
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,844
Hey! It is a foul!

233
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:47,716
One second! She's hurt!
Krishnaji, go to her!

234
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:50,785
Gul are you alright?

235
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,037
Water! Here drink this!
Stretch, stretch..

236
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,802
From this moment on, I don't
want to see the ball in our half.

237
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,399
Balbir, you play your game.

238
00:29:05,476 --> 00:29:07,137
I'll...I'll beat these girls!

239
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:11,979
So beat them. If they hit one of us,
you hit 4. If they hit 4, you hit 8.

240
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,348
Rough them so bad that they're scared
of picking up a hockey stick again.

241
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,287
Sir - Don't let them dare come
in the way of Preeti, Komal, Nethra.

242
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:20,756
Attack them. Don't stop
attacking them till they break.

243
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:23,191
Or you break!

244
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:38,366
Forward up!

245
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,346
Yes!

246
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,348
Chak de!

247
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,938
Yes! Yes!

248
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:17,814
The lndian team coached by
Kabir Khan has reached..

249
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:20,146
..the semi finals
of the Championship.

250
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,379
We are in the semi finals!

251
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,214
Did you ever doubt it?

252
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,818
But now lndia will be up
against South Korea..

253
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,522
..a team that hasn't let a
single team reach its goal.

254
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,030
Man to man marking?

255
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:40,003
Ya. A player behind each player.
This is Korea's game.

256
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,902
We will be paralysed by this game,
leave alone scoring goals.

257
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,536
Who can crack this kind of game?

258
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,176
There is one player.

259
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:07,922
You were right. You do have
something that she just doesn't.

260
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,293
And that no other
girl on this team has.

261
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,275
Take this.

262
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:35,483
Why?

263
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:37,519
Why?

264
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:43,627
Because right now lndia needs
its most experienced player.

265
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:50,634
Only you know how to
break man to man marking.

266
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,911
The match is about to begin. Go.

267
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,641
Go and break it.

268
00:32:11,392 --> 00:32:14,327
As expected, Korea's
man to man marking..

269
00:32:14,395 --> 00:32:17,057
..has paralysed
the lndian forwards..

270
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:21,994
Aliya Bose, Preeti Sabarwal, Komal
Chautala - no player can move an inch..

271
00:32:24,672 --> 00:32:25,730
Mary!

272
00:32:28,743 --> 00:32:31,576
Substitution! No.5
Bindia Naik on field..

273
00:32:35,683 --> 00:32:39,983
There's a sudden shift..the game
seems to be changing direction..

274
00:32:43,925 --> 00:32:46,860
Defenders Bindia Naik and
Gunjan Lakhani are on attack -

275
00:32:46,928 --> 00:32:50,694
They are playing in a unique
style..Korean players are confused..

276
00:32:56,637 --> 00:32:57,797
And goal!

277
00:33:06,814 --> 00:33:07,872
Chak de!

278
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:18,516
Yes!

279
00:33:20,895 --> 00:33:21,953
We won!

280
00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:24,725
India has reached the
World Championship Finals!

281
00:33:25,466 --> 00:33:27,400
By the sound in this stadium,
you can guess what..

282
00:33:27,468 --> 00:33:30,096
..the state of the
lndian team must be.

283
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:33,402
And what state its Coach must be in..
who couple of months ago was stopped

284
00:33:33,474 --> 00:33:37,911
from bringing his team
to the Championship.

285
00:33:37,979 --> 00:33:40,413
Who could have guessed that one of
the world's best center forwards

286
00:33:40,481 --> 00:33:43,416
would score such a
smashing goal in World hockey

287
00:33:43,484 --> 00:33:46,851
without even lifting a hockey
stick or entering the field..

288
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,929
Hi Bill!
- Well played!

289
00:34:52,553 --> 00:34:54,487
You are definitely
going to be the Highest..

290
00:34:54,555 --> 00:34:56,045
..Scorer of the World Championship.

291
00:34:57,992 --> 00:35:04,227
But you have got competition. See!
8 goals. Komal's ahead once more

292
00:35:04,565 --> 00:35:08,899
You idiots! You have your own
World Championship going on.

293
00:35:11,572 --> 00:35:15,668
Hello.. Sukhlalji! Speak up!

294
00:35:16,844 --> 00:35:22,077
Amazing Krishnaji! These devils
have been raising quite a hell!

295
00:35:22,149 --> 00:35:24,242
With your blessings, Sukhlalji

296
00:35:24,585 --> 00:35:26,519
The travelling
theatre had come by, didi..

297
00:35:26,587 --> 00:35:28,521
I made it very clear
to them that this is..

298
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:30,147
..the lndian women
hockey team's ground.

299
00:35:30,591 --> 00:35:33,890
It is waiting for its team. I'm
not going to give it out to anyone..

300
00:35:33,961 --> 00:35:36,589
Now there will only be
hockey practise here.

301
00:35:36,664 --> 00:35:39,030
Hello, here! Speak here! Oof!

302
00:35:40,601 --> 00:35:44,059
Hello! I am really missing
your curd rice, Sukhlalji.

303
00:35:44,605 --> 00:35:47,165
If you guys win the World Cup, child

304
00:35:47,608 --> 00:35:50,771
I will make curd rice
for you all my life.

305
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:54,677
Don't lose now. Don't lose.

306
00:35:56,884 --> 00:36:01,617
We will not, Mr. Sukhlal. We will
lose our lives, but not the game.

307
00:36:03,758 --> 00:36:07,626
I was your third colour once

308
00:36:07,695 --> 00:36:11,290
Your tune was the rhythm of my life

309
00:36:11,632 --> 00:36:15,932
You were my master,
you were my pride

310
00:36:16,003 --> 00:36:21,908
My master, my life is yours to take

311
00:36:21,976 --> 00:36:24,638
What are you doing here, sir?

312
00:36:27,081 --> 00:36:32,917
Look. It is the first time I've seen
a foreigner raise the lndian flag.

313
00:36:36,657 --> 00:36:40,093
We have reached the final.
Is it a dream?

314
00:36:41,996 --> 00:36:43,224
What do you think?

315
00:36:43,664 --> 00:36:44,961
It must be a dream.

316
00:36:47,668 --> 00:36:48,930
It is your dream, isn't it?

317
00:36:57,945 --> 00:37:04,874
My master, my life is yours to take

318
00:37:05,686 --> 00:37:07,620
Thank you very much
for being here..

319
00:37:07,688 --> 00:37:10,680
..Tonight is the night for an
official reception for the finalists.

320
00:37:10,758 --> 00:37:16,697
The Federation of lnternational Hockey
is holding a dinner in their honour.

321
00:37:16,764 --> 00:37:20,632
So that tonight they can
forget about winning or losing

322
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:24,899
and just celebrate that they are
the two best teams in the world.

323
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:41,654
Ladies and gentlemen,
the six times..

324
00:37:41,722 --> 00:37:43,656
..World Cup champions,
the team from Australia.

325
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:08,305
Oh.. Sorry! Best of luck!

326
00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:10,410
Yes, yes..Happy Diwali!

327
00:38:10,751 --> 00:38:11,843
What's she saying?

328
00:38:11,919 --> 00:38:15,685
She's saying..watch out for the
fireworks tomorrow - Excuse me!

329
00:38:19,026 --> 00:38:20,755
Do we have to wear this?

330
00:38:20,828 --> 00:38:22,193
It is a pain..

331
00:38:23,764 --> 00:38:25,857
Do you care for a drink?
- No, thank you

332
00:38:31,906 --> 00:38:32,964
What is it Nethra?

333
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,098
Nothing..

334
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:39,338
What is it?
- What do you mean?

335
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,213
I mean why did you call me here?

336
00:38:42,049 --> 00:38:43,778
Me? You're the one who called me

337
00:38:43,851 --> 00:38:45,978
Did a mad dog bite me?
No way I would call you!

338
00:38:46,053 --> 00:38:47,281
I have called you.

339
00:38:50,224 --> 00:38:53,193
You.. but why sir?

340
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:59,861
To tell you that tomorrow we
are going to lose the finals.

341
00:38:59,934 --> 00:39:02,300
What? Why?

342
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:03,461
Why?

343
00:39:04,805 --> 00:39:07,740
Because tomorrow, two of our players

344
00:39:07,808 --> 00:39:11,039
are going to play for Australia.

345
00:39:14,315 --> 00:39:16,215
No, no, sir, it is not like that..

346
00:39:16,283 --> 00:39:19,810
What do you think? That the
Australian coach and team are blind?

347
00:39:19,887 --> 00:39:21,752
You think they haven't
figured out that lndia's..

348
00:39:21,822 --> 00:39:24,416
..main forwards do
not pass to each other?

349
00:39:25,092 --> 00:39:28,152
You think they will not
take advantage of this fact?

350
00:39:29,163 --> 00:39:31,961
Sir, whatever I do is for the team..

351
00:39:32,032 --> 00:39:37,231
Komal, you cannot fool me, at
least do not try and fool yourself.

352
00:39:38,105 --> 00:39:39,766
You fought with you father,
mother, brother,..

353
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,138
..your village to come
here and play hockey,.

354
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:46,009
But now you are playing at
something else. Even you know this.

355
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,105
Tell her sir. She's the
one who started it all.

356
00:39:48,182 --> 00:39:50,082
And you are the one who
will finish it tomorrow?

357
00:39:51,318 --> 00:39:53,286
Is that the plan?

358
00:39:58,292 --> 00:40:02,092
And you, Preeti Sabarwal,

359
00:40:04,865 --> 00:40:07,299
Chandigarh Captain..

360
00:40:08,235 --> 00:40:11,170
You lost your senses
to join this team..

361
00:40:12,873 --> 00:40:16,274
But now you have
lost all sense.. Why?

362
00:40:20,314 --> 00:40:21,474
Neither of you is a child.

363
00:40:21,882 --> 00:40:23,816
You know very well
that if you do not play..

364
00:40:23,884 --> 00:40:25,818
..together for the
same side tomorrow,

365
00:40:25,886 --> 00:40:27,114
we will never win the finals.

366
00:40:30,157 --> 00:40:34,150
Once upon a time, an
lndian team had lost a final.

367
00:40:36,897 --> 00:40:41,891
You don't know what it is
like to bear that cross..

368
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:47,339
But when you do, it
will be too heavy to bear.

369
00:40:47,908 --> 00:40:50,240
Neither of you has the
strength to bear it.

370
00:40:51,178 --> 00:40:52,839
Nobody has the strength to bear it!

371
00:40:54,915 --> 00:40:57,440
You both know what the
problem between you two is.

372
00:40:57,918 --> 00:41:00,580
All I know is that whether you
both play on our side or not,

373
00:41:01,388 --> 00:41:05,256
the rest of my team will
play together against Australia.

374
00:41:05,926 --> 00:41:08,190
And if necessary
against both of you as well.

375
00:41:09,196 --> 00:41:10,925
The ball is in your court.

376
00:41:12,366 --> 00:41:18,930
Do you want to play with
your team or against it.

377
00:41:26,547 --> 00:41:30,608
Whatever happens, I will
score the most goals..

378
00:41:31,218 --> 00:41:32,947
What are you trying to prove?

379
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,510
I am not trying to
prove anything, Komal.

380
00:41:35,956 --> 00:41:39,483
I just want to show a foolish
boy what a woman is capable of.

381
00:41:40,394 --> 00:41:42,225
I will score the most goals,
no matter what happens.

382
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:48,096
I want to see you try and do it.

383
00:41:50,904 --> 00:42:00,905
Y

384
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:12,084
And tonight is the night that
everybody has been waiting for.

385
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:15,219
The night of the Women's
Hockey World Championship finals.

386
00:42:15,295 --> 00:42:20,358
A match that is
completely unexpected.

387
00:42:20,434 --> 00:42:25,269
Because tonight we have current
and 6 times World Champions Australia

388
00:42:25,339 --> 00:42:29,207
playing against lndia - a team
that has risen like a juggernaut.

389
00:42:29,276 --> 00:42:30,937
A team that has won the
hearts of many with its..

390
00:42:31,011 --> 00:42:33,571
..dazzling display of
determination and skill.

391
00:42:33,647 --> 00:42:37,276
But winning hearts and winning the
World Cup are two different things.

392
00:42:37,351 --> 00:42:44,018
And this is the ordeal by
fire of Coach Kabir Khan's team.

393
00:42:44,091 --> 00:42:47,686
By what strategy,
what skill, what magic

394
00:42:47,761 --> 00:42:55,190
will this team from lndia beat the
game of the six times World champions..

395
00:43:00,307 --> 00:43:01,365
Girls!

396
00:43:26,533 --> 00:43:27,591
Seventy minutes.

397
00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:30,730
Seventy minutes is all you have.

398
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:37,402
Perhaps the most important
seventy minutes of your life.

399
00:43:38,212 --> 00:43:41,238
Today, whether you
play very well or badly,

400
00:43:42,082 --> 00:43:44,744
you will always remember these seventy
minutes for the rest of your life.

401
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:50,354
Today I won't tell you how to play.

402
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:53,758
All I will say is:

403
00:43:55,095 --> 00:43:59,725
Go! And play for all you're
worth in these seventy minutes.

404
00:44:02,369 --> 00:44:08,535
Because in the days to come
whether life goes well for you or not,

405
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:12,044
whether you have
something to call your..

406
00:44:12,112 --> 00:44:13,238
..own or not,
whether you win or lose,

407
00:44:13,313 --> 00:44:15,042
these seventy
minutes are something..

408
00:44:15,115 --> 00:44:17,481
..that nobody can
ever take away from you.

409
00:44:18,252 --> 00:44:19,310
Nobody.

410
00:44:22,556 --> 00:44:26,287
So I thought,

411
00:44:28,128 --> 00:44:31,256
I will not tell you how
to play today's match.

412
00:44:31,331 --> 00:44:34,425
You will. By playing it.

413
00:44:36,136 --> 00:44:40,072
Because I know that if
in these seventy minutes,

414
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,201
each player of this team plays
the best hockey of her life,

415
00:44:45,412 --> 00:44:49,314
then not even God can take
away your seventy minutes.

416
00:44:51,585 --> 00:44:52,643
So go!

417
00:44:54,688 --> 00:44:56,315
Go and steal those seventy minutes
- from yourself.

418
00:44:58,592 --> 00:45:00,719
From your life. From God.

419
00:45:00,794 --> 00:45:05,595
From anyone who did not
have any faith in you..

420
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:09,158
Go and steal your seventy minutes.

421
00:45:15,442 --> 00:45:16,841
Chak De!

422
00:45:27,454 --> 00:45:28,512
Go Aussies!

423
00:45:29,323 --> 00:45:30,449
Come on girls!

424
00:45:52,646 --> 00:45:54,204
Towards the left side!

425
00:46:26,246 --> 00:46:29,181
In the very first minute,
lndia has shown that

426
00:46:29,249 --> 00:46:31,547
it will not play this
match as an underdog team.

427
00:46:37,524 --> 00:46:41,927
Just how important this goal
was for the team's psyche,

428
00:46:42,262 --> 00:46:44,730
is reflected in the look of
pride on Coach Kabir Khan's face.

429
00:46:44,798 --> 00:46:46,197
What the hell just happened?
They have..

430
00:46:46,266 --> 00:46:48,257
..changed something.
Find out what it is.

431
00:46:53,206 --> 00:46:54,537
Australia's counter attack -

432
00:47:07,554 --> 00:47:08,646
And save!

433
00:47:08,722 --> 00:47:12,214
Australia is not a team to
take things lying down..

434
00:47:12,292 --> 00:47:15,352
and its the attack could
be a danger to lndia..

435
00:47:15,429 --> 00:47:17,454
Gunjan to Komal..

436
00:47:17,531 --> 00:47:18,589
Komal pass!

437
00:47:19,566 --> 00:47:20,794
Nice dodge..

438
00:47:20,867 --> 00:47:23,427
Komal! Pass to Preeti! Pass!

439
00:47:29,309 --> 00:47:31,971
Preeti Sabarwal has scored
8 goals in the tournament,

440
00:47:40,454 --> 00:47:41,580
Half time

441
00:47:44,758 --> 00:47:47,727
And somehow lndia has managed
to hold on to its advantage.

442
00:47:47,794 --> 00:47:50,991
But the second half has always
been Australia's strong point.

443
00:48:01,942 --> 00:48:04,274
Australia's strong attack..
India under pressure..

444
00:48:10,684 --> 00:48:11,742
Reverse hit..

445
00:48:12,486 --> 00:48:13,544
and goal!

446
00:48:44,851 --> 00:48:46,375
A pass..
- Move with them!

447
00:48:48,388 --> 00:48:50,447
Once more, Australia on attack..

448
00:48:53,527 --> 00:48:54,824
Push.. and goal!

449
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:11,971
India-1, Australia-2.

450
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:19,341
Only a few minutes
left and Australia's..

451
00:49:19,419 --> 00:49:22,411
..strategy is to not
let go of the ball..

452
00:49:22,489 --> 00:49:24,980
and kill lndia's chances
of scoring an equaliser..

453
00:49:29,429 --> 00:49:32,887
Australia has the ball..
but lndia has snatched it!

454
00:49:36,703 --> 00:49:37,761
Go Komal!

455
00:49:50,917 --> 00:49:52,441
Come out! She won't pass!

456
00:49:58,458 --> 00:49:59,823
Preeti!

457
00:50:00,727 --> 00:50:02,456
Show the idiot!

458
00:50:47,507 --> 00:50:48,565
Thank you!

459
00:51:16,002 --> 00:51:18,527
Move back!

460
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:21,837
Emily! Get out there!

461
00:51:26,813 --> 00:51:27,871
Come on! There is still time!

462
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:40,551
And end of extra time..
smiles in the lndian camp

463
00:51:40,627 --> 00:51:43,858
Because now they will face the
Australian team in a tie breaker..

464
00:51:44,564 --> 00:51:48,557
For lndia it means a genuine
chance to win this tournament.

465
00:51:48,635 --> 00:51:51,763
Because now, the winner will be
decided by a penalty shoot out.

466
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:57,504
Each team will have a chance
of hitting 5 penalty strokes..

467
00:51:57,577 --> 00:52:01,570
And the team with the most goals
will become the World Champion!

468
00:52:02,011 --> 00:52:04,411
Didi, now everything is up to you.

469
00:52:05,014 --> 00:52:06,413
Save us Vidya didi!

470
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:13,280
Preeti, Aliya, Bindia, Mary,
Nethra.. Come! Quick! Come here girls!

471
00:52:13,757 --> 00:52:15,691
You girls are taking the penalty.

472
00:52:15,759 --> 00:52:18,250
Remember one thing - don't attack
the goal but the goalkeeper's mind.

473
00:52:18,328 --> 00:52:20,023
You will win the goal automatically.

474
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:23,031
We can win it. Come
on girls! Well done!

475
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:26,000
Sir, if Komal can take my stroke..

476
00:52:28,772 --> 00:52:31,036
Komal! Quick!

477
00:52:34,043 --> 00:52:36,011
Preeti wants you to take her stroke.

478
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:42,180
Alright, let's get this going!
Come on everyone! All the best!

479
00:52:52,796 --> 00:52:54,457
Australia-2, lndia-2.

480
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,134
India's first striker is right
out Nethra Reddy from Andhra

481
00:53:03,072 --> 00:53:05,131
Come on Nethra!

482
00:53:07,811 --> 00:53:08,903
Goalie ready?

483
00:53:10,246 --> 00:53:11,304
Yeah!

484
00:53:12,081 --> 00:53:13,139
Striker ready?

485
00:53:25,295 --> 00:53:27,229
And lndia has
wasted its first chance.

486
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:35,065
Every missed
stroke can prove costly.

487
00:53:39,309 --> 00:53:42,767
Now it is Australia's turn.
Defending the..

488
00:53:42,846 --> 00:53:45,007
..Indian goal is Vidya Sharma,
lndia's captain

489
00:53:47,383 --> 00:53:50,079
Australia's No. 1 Sarah Abernathy.

490
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:55,416
Goalie ready?

491
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:57,353
Ready!

492
00:53:58,428 --> 00:53:59,520
Striker ready?

493
00:54:04,868 --> 00:54:09,862
And goal! A swift ground shot
that can leave any goalie stumped.

494
00:54:10,874 --> 00:54:12,501
India-2, Australia-3.

495
00:54:22,886 --> 00:54:23,944
Aliya Bose..

496
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,386
Come on Aliya!

497
00:54:31,361 --> 00:54:33,522
Another miss!

498
00:54:35,164 --> 00:54:38,497
Opportunities wasted and
the Cup grows further away

499
00:54:41,905 --> 00:54:42,963
Striker Sheryl Jones..

500
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:46,433
Goalie ready?

501
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:49,469
Striker ready?

502
00:54:52,181 --> 00:54:53,341
And another goal!

503
00:54:53,917 --> 00:54:56,181
Australia is growing stronger..

504
00:55:00,189 --> 00:55:03,852
Now to stay in the game lndia
will have to stop every stroke..

505
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:06,259
..and convert every
stroke into a goal.

506
00:55:08,197 --> 00:55:11,564
At this crucial moment,
we have Komal Chautala..

507
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:20,239
Centre forward from
Haryana and the team's right in.

508
00:55:24,948 --> 00:55:26,882
Come on Komal! Just hit it!

509
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:32,346
Aussies!

510
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,953
A beautiful strike and goal!
India manages to save itself.

511
00:55:50,406 --> 00:55:52,431
India-3, Australia-4

512
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:56,271
Vidya Sharma ready once more..

513
00:55:58,247 --> 00:56:02,445
Rachael Taylor ready..
No room for mistakes..

514
00:56:12,328 --> 00:56:13,556
And a great save!

515
00:56:26,275 --> 00:56:28,243
India-3, Australia-4

516
00:56:32,148 --> 00:56:34,946
There is still hope
for lndia, but to win,

517
00:56:35,018 --> 00:56:37,077
it will have to convert the
next two strokes into goals.

518
00:56:39,422 --> 00:56:44,359
India's next striker, penalty
shoot out specialist - Mary Ralte.

519
00:56:49,565 --> 00:56:51,533
A great scoop and goal!

520
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:57,700
Making lndia on par with Australia..

521
00:56:59,442 --> 00:57:01,967
But Australia has
two more strokes and..

522
00:57:02,045 --> 00:57:04,673
..India, one.
- Come on Vidya didi! Save it

523
00:57:07,517 --> 00:57:09,542
Australian striker Emily Jones.

524
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:32,007
India's last chance.. It is
imperative to score and that is why

525
00:57:32,075 --> 00:57:36,307
experienced Bindia Naik
will take this stroke.

526
00:57:36,379 --> 00:57:38,074
Come on Bindia didi!

527
00:57:55,231 --> 00:57:57,529
Maybe this is what
they call experience!

528
00:58:05,108 --> 00:58:07,668
We come now to the last
stroke of the penalty shoot out.

529
00:58:08,377 --> 00:58:11,710
If Australia scores, the
shoot out will continue.

530
00:58:12,115 --> 00:58:17,678
But if Vidya saves the goal, then
this lndian team will make history.

531
00:58:20,556 --> 00:58:22,183
India-Pakistan

532
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:28,526
Just one penalty stroke between
lndia and the World Championship..

533
00:58:29,398 --> 00:58:31,298
India is one goal behind Pakistan.

534
00:58:31,367 --> 00:58:33,358
But Captain Kabir is
taking the stroke himself..

535
00:58:33,436 --> 00:58:35,267
Why did you take the
penalty stroke yourself?

536
00:58:35,338 --> 00:58:38,637
You do not know what it is
like to bear that cross..

537
00:58:48,084 --> 00:58:51,349
She will hit on the left
- her stick is turned to the left.

538
00:58:52,522 --> 00:58:55,753
But her foot is facing right
- She will hit right.

539
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:59,822
Left, no right, no left.. Oh my God!

540
00:59:00,163 --> 00:59:01,460
She is going to hit
straight into the goal!

541
00:59:02,165 --> 00:59:05,225
Vidya! Look at me!

542
00:59:06,435 --> 00:59:07,493
Look at me, Vidya

543
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:29,174
My master

544
01:00:29,252 --> 01:00:32,653
I was your third colour once

545
01:00:34,257 --> 01:00:39,251
You were my master,
you were my pride

546
01:00:41,264 --> 01:00:47,692
My master, my life is yours to take

547
01:01:05,821 --> 01:01:08,221
And now Ladies & Gentlemen, we..

548
01:01:08,291 --> 01:01:11,783
..present to you the new
World Champions, Team lndia..

549
01:01:38,321 --> 01:01:39,413
Jaya Hind! (Hail lndia)

550
01:01:40,323 --> 01:01:44,259
By becoming World Champions,
the lndian Women's hockey..

551
01:01:44,327 --> 01:01:46,955
..team has made
every lndian's heart sing

552
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:50,265
And the man who gave lndia this
victory is none other than Kabir Khan,

553
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:52,426
one of Asia's best Center forwards.

554
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:55,265
The thrill of our victory
is singing in the blood..

555
01:01:55,338 --> 01:01:57,670
..of thousands of
lndians waiting here

556
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:00,004
at the airport for the man
of the moment - Kabir Khan.

557
01:02:00,343 --> 01:02:02,277
But he does not seem to be
here in this moment of glory..

558
01:02:02,345 --> 01:02:04,336
Where is Kabir Khan?

559
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:09,284
What do ex - players
have to say about the man..

560
01:02:09,352 --> 01:02:11,752
..who returned to
the game after 7 years?

561
01:02:12,355 --> 01:02:14,289
As long as players
like Kabir Khan exist,..

562
01:02:14,357 --> 01:02:16,450
..Indian hockey can
hold its head high.

563
01:02:16,525 --> 01:02:18,288
Brother Khan has proved that
there is no greater motivation..

564
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:20,488
.. than playing for your flag

565
01:02:20,563 --> 01:02:24,795
Kabir Khan - the spirit of lndia!
Kabir Khan - the pride of lndia!

566
01:02:25,368 --> 01:02:27,302
The credit of winning
this trophy, is being..

567
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:28,803
..given to the team's coach
- Kabir Khan

568
01:02:28,871 --> 01:02:32,363
And what does the man on
the street have to say?

569
01:02:32,441 --> 01:02:33,499
There can be no one more
respected than the man..

570
01:02:33,576 --> 01:02:35,009
..who raised the
status of our National game.

571
01:02:35,378 --> 01:02:37,312
He makes you feel proud
to be an lndian. -..

572
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,473
..Kabir Khan has showed us
all who a true lndian is

573
01:02:39,548 --> 01:02:44,042
Kabir Khan - the spirit of lndia!
Kabir Khan - the pride of lndia!

574
01:03:06,409 --> 01:03:08,673
TRAlTOR

575
01:03:23,759 --> 01:03:29,026
Chak de! Chak de lndia!(Go lndia!)

576
01:03:40,576 --> 01:03:41,804
Chak de!

577
01:03:45,714 --> 01:03:47,875
O Chak de!

578
01:03:48,451 --> 01:03:51,909
I was your third colour once

579
01:03:51,987 --> 01:03:56,014
Your tune was the rhythm of my life

580
01:03:56,091 --> 01:04:00,050
You were my master,
you were my pride

581
01:04:00,463 --> 01:04:07,096
My master, my life is yours to take

582
01:04:19,748 --> 01:04:21,409
So Preeti has no clue that
you are going to propose..

583
01:04:21,484 --> 01:04:23,975
..to her before the entire country?

584
01:04:24,053 --> 01:04:25,418
No, she has no idea.

585
01:04:25,488 --> 01:04:26,546
What if she says no?

586
01:04:38,634 --> 01:04:42,627
Preeti.. will you marry me?

587
01:04:44,507 --> 01:04:46,998
Preeti, tell us, will
you marry Abhimanyu?

588
01:04:47,776 --> 01:04:48,834
No

589
01:04:51,514 --> 01:04:53,141
She's only joking. Move!

590
01:04:53,516 --> 01:04:54,847
What was that?

591
01:04:54,917 --> 01:04:56,111
The truth.

592
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,578
Where are you going?

593
01:04:58,787 --> 01:04:59,845
To my team.

594
01:04:59,922 --> 01:05:02,447
But what about us Preeti?
You and me?

595
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:07,819
Us? We never existed Abhi..
it was only you..

596
01:05:07,897 --> 01:05:12,527
But now even I exist. I
don't need to be your wife.

597
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:18,531
Have a good life, and learn
some sportsman spirit if you can

598
01:05:20,075 --> 01:05:22,908
Preeti has refused.
What is your plan now?

599
01:05:25,814 --> 01:05:26,974
This is for you.

600
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:28,983
How are you mum? How are you dad?

601
01:05:29,051 --> 01:05:31,485
I just want to say one thing Komal.
If I ever stop you from playing again,

602
01:05:31,554 --> 01:05:34,546
just give me a couple of
whacks with this very stick.

603
01:05:34,623 --> 01:05:35,817
No dad!

604
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:37,483
No, Komal. If anyone
else's father stops..

605
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:40,051
..her from playing,
whack him as well!

606
01:05:40,129 --> 01:05:42,495
When his daughter
makes a name all..

607
01:05:42,565 --> 01:05:44,829
..over the world, he
will forget everything.

608
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,231
Dad!

609
01:05:53,842 --> 01:05:54,900
Madam!

610
01:05:56,579 --> 01:05:59,070
Madam?
- Mr. Sukhlal!

611
01:05:59,582 --> 01:06:01,777
Call us an army of devils,
Mr. Sukhlal.

612
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:03,511
Now that the rest of the
world calls us by that name,..

613
01:06:03,586 --> 01:06:05,645
..why are you shying away from it?

614
01:06:06,855 --> 01:06:08,254
What do you want 400 rupees for?

615
01:06:08,857 --> 01:06:10,518
Just because you
brought me to the airport,..

616
01:06:10,593 --> 01:06:11,855
..you can't charge
me whatever you wish!

617
01:06:11,927 --> 01:06:13,519
Don't get so angry!
You are going to..

618
01:06:13,596 --> 01:06:15,826
..self destruct with
anger one of these days!

619
01:06:15,898 --> 01:06:17,729
Here, drink some water! Be calm!

620
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,132
And brother, please
don't charge us extra.

621
01:06:20,202 --> 01:06:24,866
Come along peacefully now. You won't
get anywhere by having such a temper.

622
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:25,998
Congrats Vidya..

623
01:06:26,075 --> 01:06:27,133
Thank you!

624
01:06:27,209 --> 01:06:31,009
Come on, everyone is
waiting for you, especially Dad.

625
01:06:31,614 --> 01:06:35,607
He says that his daughter-in-law
has made him really proud.
