00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,666
POWER PROGRESS VICTORY

2
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,958
40th birthday, 50th birthday,
60th birthday...

3
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,750
There hasn't been a single birthday

4
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:16,375
where I peacefully greeted him
with "Happy birthday, Papa."

5
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,000
We always fought over
one thing or another.

6
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,416
Brother, it's seven o'clock
in the morning.

7
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:29,125
How much more do you wish to drink?

8
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:33,500
Papa used to say that
when your son will become like you,

9
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:35,625
{\an8}then you'll understand how I feel.

10
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,208
{\an8}And I used to tell him, "Papa, when
I didn't turn out to be like you...

11
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,625
then why would my son
turn out to be like me?"

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,208
Once upon a time,
there was this king

13
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,500
who had a sexy daughter,
a young princess.

14
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,416
One day, she was taking
a bath out in the jungle,

15
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,208
and this monkey showed up
and started mimicking and teasing her.

16
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,291
Princess got angry
and splashed water at the monkey.

17
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,083
The monkey splashed water
back at her, and he gestured...

18
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,250
Princess got upset, obviously.

19
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,166
She went straight to the king
and told him,

20
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,250
"Papa, there is a toxic monkey
in the jungle teasing me!

21
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,166
He is making such lewd gestures."

22
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:25,791
The king got furious.

23
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,125
He called his minister over and said,
"What the fuck!

24
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:31,208
There's a cheeky monkey
in the jungle messing with my daughter.

25
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,666
Go and deal with him."

26
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,416
The minister went up to the monkey
and asked him,

27
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,000
"What do you think you're doing, dude?

28
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,416
You're freaking out
the entire royal court."

29
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,375
And the monkey said,
"What do you think you're doing, dude?

30
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,333
You're freaking out
the entire royal court."

31
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:48,291
Whatever the minister did or said,
the monkey would repeat it.

32
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:52,958
The minister got all confused
and started racking his brain.

33
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,125
Then he got an idea!

34
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,375
He summoned two swords,
one real and one fake.

35
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,000
He kept the fake one for himself,

36
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,375
and he threw the real sword towards
the monkey.

37
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,500
Then, he took the fake sword and...

38
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,875
pretended to act all dramatic
like he was dying.

39
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,166
The monkey saw this...

40
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,500
grabbed the real sword and went...

41
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,541
Hey!

42
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,875
<i>Silence! Silence!</i>

43
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,166
<i>Silence, class!</i>

44
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,750
{\an8}<i>Now, children, behave yourselves!</i>

45
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,333
{\an8}<i>Who will define what an animal is?</i>

46
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:49,416
Animals are multicellular organisms
in the biological kingdom Animalia.

47
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,041
Animals consume organic material,

48
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,791
breathe oxygen and reproduce.

49
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:57,250
The word "animal"
comes from the Latin animalis,

50
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,125
meaning "having breath or soul".

51
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,666
Where are you going?

52
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:05,125
- How dare you disturb my class?
- Ma'am, my sisters have come.

53
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,333
- Show me your hand.
- Today's my father's birthday.

54
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,666
Show me your hand!

55
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:14,500
Hand up!

56
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:19,041
Just go and kneel down there
till the class gets over!

57
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,333
So, in carnivorous
and omnivorous species,

58
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:34,708
the predators feed
on the another organism called its prey.

59
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,166
- Understood?
- Yes, ma'am.

60
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,625
{\an8}<i>There is one star in my sky</i>

61
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:42,458
{\an8}<i>And that one star is you</i>

62
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:47,250
<i>I have no one but you</i>

63
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:51,416
{\an8}<i>You are my whole world</i>

64
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,791
{\an8}<i>I put you in a place</i>

65
00:04:56,041 --> 00:05:00,083
{\an8}<i>Where no one is</i>

66
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,833
{\an8}<i>Papa, my life</i>

67
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:08,875
{\an8}<i>Keep your hand on my head every moment</i>

68
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:13,791
{\an8}- Papa!
<i>- Papa, my life, walk with me</i>

69
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:17,875
{\an8}<i>You are the stone in every river</i>

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,166
{\an8}<i>For me</i>

71
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:26,375
{\an8}<i>These methods stop with you</i>

72
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,291
{\an8}<i>-Papa, my life</i>
- Papa!

73
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:35,125
{\an8}<i>-Keep your hand on my head every moment</i>
- Papa!

74
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:40,166
{\an8}<i>-Papa, my life, walk with me</i>
- Papa!

75
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:44,083
{\an8}<i>You are the stone in every river</i>

76
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,500
{\an8}<i>For me</i>

77
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:52,833
{\an8}<i>-These methods stop with you</i>
- Papa!

78
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:54,791
{\an8}Mom!

79
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,833
Mom, where's Papa?

80
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,708
You know he is a very busy man.

81
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,208
He had to rush to the factory, son.

82
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,625
Hey, let's make a clone of your father...

83
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,416
so we can have one at home
and one at the office.

84
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,166
Cloning takes too long.

85
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,000
We'll have to find a body double.

86
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,333
But no matter
how many lookalikes we find,

87
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,875
no one can compare to Papa.

88
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:24,208
{\an8}<i>You are constantly in my heart</i>

89
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:28,250
<i>- Just like my heartbeat</i>
- Papa!

90
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:33,083
{\an8}<i>You are with me in my head
No matter where I go</i>

91
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:37,083
{\an8}<i>Whether you are there or not</i>

92
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,541
{\an8}<i>-You are always there in my sight</i>
- Papa!

93
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:45,083
{\an8}- Papa!
<i>- Wherever I go</i>

94
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,166
{\an8}Papa...

95
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,333
{\an8}<i>Papa, my life
Keep your hand on my head...</i>

96
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,125
{\an8}The kids made a cake for you.

97
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,708
They waited for you,
but got tired and went to bed.

98
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,166
And you didn't even bother

99
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,208
to meet the kids on your birthday
despite calling them from school.

100
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
Don't worry, Jyoti.

101
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,083
I'll make it up.

102
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,000
They notice everything, you know?

103
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,708
And it bothers them.

104
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,458
You know what he said yesterday?

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,166
He wants to change his name...

106
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,625
to Balbir Singh II.

107
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,000
I argued, but he said...

108
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,416
"If there can be a George II
and Henry VIII,

109
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,125
then why not Balbir Singh II?"

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,583
{\an8}I hope you realize
that you are his superhero.

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,500
{\an8}Can't you spare just ten minutes
of your day for your son?

112
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:54,250
{\an8}<i>Papa, in my next life,
I want you to be my son.</i>

113
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,916
{\an8}<i>I want you to see how much I love you.</i>

114
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,291
{\an8}<i>You can learn from it.</i>

115
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,916
{\an8}<i>Because in the life after that,</i>

116
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,458
{\an8}<i>I will once again be your son,
and you will be my papa.</i>

117
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,416
<i>Then you can express your love
in your own unique way</i>

118
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:06,791
{\an8}<i>instead of how I do it.</i>

119
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,458
{\an8}<i>I hope you understand, Papa.</i>

120
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,583
{\an8}<i>If you do, that would be more
than enough for me.</i>

121
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,583
{\an8}- Happy birthday to your father!
- Thank you.

122
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,541
{\an8}- Happy birthday to your papa!
- Thank you.

123
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,125
- Happy birthday to your papa!
- Thank you.

124
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,083
- How could you forget your bag at school?
- Happy birthday to your papa!

125
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,583
Do you know who his father is?

126
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,000
He can buy him a new bag every day.

127
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:34,750
I was finally going to meet my father
after the third-grade final exams.

128
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,083
I really love my father.

129
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,583
More than anything
in the whole wide world.

130
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,458
Everyone loves their parents.

131
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:40,708
So, how is yours any special?

132
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,916
What do you mean by
"more than anything"?

133
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,208
How do you measure love?

134
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,750
- With time.
- How?

135
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:49,125
Well, it's like studying all year
and then getting grades that tell

136
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,541
who failed, who passed,
and who came first, right?

137
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,500
In the same way, time will show

138
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,166
if my love for my father

139
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:02,416
fails, passes, or comes out on top.

140
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:53,916
Hey, hero!

141
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,250
- When did you get here?
- Kartik!

142
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,833
When did you fly back, man?

143
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,875
Just today.

144
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,500
- Listen, tomorrow is Papa's 60th birthday.
- Got it.

145
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,250
- You got to be there.
- Of course, I'll be there.

146
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,166
You're the only one missing
from the pictures. Come with me!

147
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,166
- Did you set a date for the wedding?
- Yeah, it's happening in two days.

148
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,333
Guys, come join for school song.
Everybody, school song.

149
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,000
No one remembers
the school song, dude.

150
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,916
Today, I'll help them take
a trip down memory lane.

151
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,500
Where the hell did you disappear to?

152
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:14,625
{\an8}<i>We are children full of light</i>

153
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,875
<i>Walking together hands held tight</i>

154
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,791
<i>Joyous song we now recite</i>

155
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:27,041
<i>Believing that our dreams are bright</i>

156
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:31,041
<i>Helping giving back to ye</i>

157
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:35,166
<i>All because you showed the way</i>

158
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:39,583
<i>Holding hands, we'll build together</i>

159
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,750
<i>A better brighter tomorrow!</i>

160
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,750
Brother, when did you
get back from America?

161
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,500
You totally look like an American now!

162
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,875
And thank you so much
for playing the school song, brother.

163
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,500
It brought back
all those childhood memories.

164
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:55,333
<i>- You have taught us will and might</i>
- Come here.

165
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,166
- Come.
<i>- St. Mary's in you we take pride</i>

166
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,208
When you have a beautiful girl
in the family,

167
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:04,416
and she's got a brother
who's got a bunch of friends,

168
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,750
the ladies in the family choose

169
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,333
one of those friends
as her honorary brother.

170
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:11,708
You know why?

171
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:15,625
<i>We stand like rocks like family!</i>

172
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,833
I have my own sisters.

173
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,333
I know that feeling.

174
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,041
I don't have sisterly feelings for you.

175
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,916
Do you feel the same way about me
as you feel about Kartik?

176
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,083
What are you saying?

177
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,041
Tell me. It brought back all
those childhood memories, right?

178
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,166
Gitu!

179
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,250
I'll come pick you up
for dinner tomorrow.

180
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,291
Let's go.

181
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:58,958
Didn't you want to go to America?

182
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,708
Do your MBA and PhD there?
So, what happened?

183
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,625
I applied and got into
Princeton University.

184
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,875
Arvind works there.

185
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,500
So, Papa said, he's the right match.

186
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,500
I can continue my studies
after getting married.

187
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,500
And you said yes?

188
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,041
I said yes for the engagement.

189
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,583
So, you said yes for the wedding as well.

190
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,416
Yes.

191
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,458
Were you guys having an affair?

192
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,416
Do you love him?

193
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:27,500
No!

194
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,416
We talked on the phone for a week.

195
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,166
He just came back
from the US two days ago,

196
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,291
and we got engaged today.

197
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,083
You know how girls used to choose
their husbands back in the days?

198
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,083
Back in the days?

199
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,583
Let's go back in time.

200
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,875
Centuries ago,
there were two types of men...

201
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,625
the alphas and the rest.

202
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,458
Alphas were the tough ones

203
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,541
who would go into the jungle to hunt,

204
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,916
while the other men, the weaker ones,

205
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,125
would divide the hunted food
among themselves.

206
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,875
The women would skillfully cook.

207
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,166
They were responsible for nourishing
the children and the entire community.

208
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,833
That's how communities operated.

209
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,666
However, their influence extended
beyond the kitchen.

210
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,375
They also possessed
the authority to choose

211
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,666
which hunter would become
their partner in parenthood.

212
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,833
They held the power
to designate the guardians...

213
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,125
who would shield them
and their offspring

214
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,166
from the rival hunters and wild creatures.

215
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,666
It was the women who held the reins
of these crucial determinations.

216
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,666
Back then,
it wasn't about fathers, mothers,

217
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,791
caste, region, religion,
or a job at a prestigious university.

218
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:35,791
If you were there,

219
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,625
who would you choose?

220
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,125
I mean, a bunch of Arvinds or an alpha?

221
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,708
- Alpha.
- Exactly.

222
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,625
So, when all the women started
choosing strong men,

223
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,083
the weaker ones got jealous.

224
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,125
Desire and lust exist
in them as well, right?

225
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,500
That's when poetry
came into the picture.

226
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,125
"I'll bring the moon for you."

227
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,916
"I'll swim across
the river of fire for you."

228
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,541
"I'll cross the seven seas for you."

229
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,500
"I'll get you this, I'll get you that."

230
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,750
But they never really do anything.

231
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,416
The only ones
who actually do something are the...

232
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:09,833
Alphas.

233
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,250
I didn't even realize
you are touching my feet.

234
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,125
Gitanjali.

235
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,666
You have a big pelvis.

236
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,041
You mean to say I am fat?

237
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,333
No, I'm not trying to say you are fat.

238
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,958
What I mean to say is
you have a big pelvis.

239
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,833
You can accommodate healthy babies.

240
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,000
Thank you, guys.
Thanks for coming.

241
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,125
- Yeah.
- Great evening.

242
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,125
- Thank you.
- Kartik...

243
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,083
Yeah?

244
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,208
Is there any chance
that I can get married to Gitanjali?

245
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,208
What?

246
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,541
Is there a chance?

247
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,958
What are you saying, man?

248
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,916
Are you here for Uncle's birthday party
or to break off her engagement?

249
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,916
Forget about that.

250
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,375
Should I talk to your dad?

251
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,958
Hey, relax and start your engine.

252
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,833
Why did all of you stop your bikes?

253
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,125
- You should leave.
- This drama started because of your aunt.

254
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,916
Think about why, out of all your friends,
she only addresses me as "brother".

255
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,458
Your aunt must have seen something
in Gitanjali's eyes for me,

256
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,250
which made your aunt tell her
to address me as brother.

257
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,041
I proposed to her in the ninth grade.

258
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,291
Ninth grade?

259
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,000
- And what about her?
- She was in the sixth grade.

260
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,833
Then again when she was
in seventh grade, and I was in tenth.

261
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,916
- She said yes.
- What do you mean she said yes?

262
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,291
She said yes means she said yes.

263
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,375
She even invited me to her house.

264
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,166
It was Raksha Bandhan that day.

265
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,083
"Who is he, my child?"

266
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,708
"A friend of Kartik, Aunty."

267
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,958
"Oh, your brother's friend
is also your brother.

268
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,000
Tie a <i>rakhi</i> to him as well."

269
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,500
Don't you dare laugh!

270
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,708
Did Gitanjali ever call
any one of you "brother"?

271
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:54,666
{\an8}- No, bro.
- No.

272
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,750
{\an8}In school or after school?

273
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,208
{\an8}- No.
- Never.

274
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,916
{\an8}She calls me brother
when I'm with them...

275
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,166
{\an8}but uses my name when we're alone.

276
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,166
{\an8}Bro... I've noticed that too.

277
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,000
{\an8}On that very day of Raksha Bandhan,
I fell ill with a high fever.

278
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,833
Fever? Come on, man!

279
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,000
If you put in all your energy
and suddenly stop,

280
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,375
won't your body react?

281
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I had a high fever.

282
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,166
Ask her, she must have had it too.
I'm one hundred percent sure!

283
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,708
Man, if you knew all this...

284
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,250
where have you been until now?

285
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,916
I didn't know you all would be so eager
to get her married.

286
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,916
And it's not like these emotions
have suddenly resurfaced today.

287
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,250
This feeling was, is,
and will always be there.

288
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:31,875
Stop acting like a child.

289
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,791
She's getting married in two days
and leaving for the US.

290
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,125
She's not going anywhere.

291
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,208
- What?
- She's not going anywhere.

292
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,875
Do you think you can just call her
and she'll come to you?

293
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,291
She'll come running to me.

294
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:45,916
Brother!

295
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,291
She's talking to you.

296
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,958
Papa wants to talk to you.

297
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:13,958
Kalra.

298
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,041
Varun!

299
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,041
Where is everyone?

300
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,083
They're on their way, Papa.

301
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,083
Hold on a second, Varun.

302
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,416
What is it?

303
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,166
Papa, how about a picture
of just the three of us?

304
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,333
You, Grandpa, and me.

305
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:24,708
Okay.

306
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,875
Varun.

307
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,875
It's a big achievement.

308
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,250
Congratulations on the Cochin deal, son.
Well done.

309
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,916
Papa, it's my birthday gift to you.

310
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,291
Well done, son.

311
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,708
Thank you, Grandpa.

312
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,625
It's good that we were
able to organize to have

313
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,375
some family photographs taken
before the guests arrived.

314
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,083
Come here, my boy.

315
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,375
Happy birthday, Papa.

316
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,041
Thank you, Reet.

317
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,750
That's a terrific watch.

318
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,625
- What happened to your hair?
- Papa, the other one

319
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,541
who has this watch is the King of England.

320
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:57,875
What is he doing here?

321
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,208
He is Reet's brother-in-law.
Varun's younger brother.

322
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,500
Roop invited him for the group photo.

323
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,416
- Papa, do you like it?
- Of course.

324
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,166
It's very classy.

325
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,500
Happy birthday, Papa.

326
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,750
- Wow!
- Thank you.

327
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,541
You didn't get anything for Papa?

328
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,125
You came empty-handed from America?

329
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,333
I've cut my hair.

330
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,916
Papa prefers short hair.

331
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,500
It's Papa's 60th birthday.

332
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,708
You should've given
him something special.

333
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,250
- A haircut, really?
- Roop, a haircut is a commitment.

334
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,708
It's a very special gift.

335
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,166
Mom, you always defend him.

336
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,291
Nice haircut.

337
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,000
But you looked good
with long hair too.

338
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,375
It suited you.

339
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,125
I'll grow it again, Papa.

340
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,125
Mom, did you invite Grandpa's family back
in the village?

341
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,250
No.

342
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,708
This was the perfect opportunity
to make things right.

343
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,500
- Come on.
- We sent them an invitation

344
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,416
for Reet's wedding.
Did any of them show up?

345
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,500
We just sent the invite.

346
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,166
We didn't personally go there
to invite them.

347
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,625
Come on, guys.
The photographer's waiting.

348
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,416
- Grandpa?
- Yes, my boy?

349
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,958
None of your family ever visits us.

350
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,333
Why is that?

351
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,916
My family is scattered across the world.

352
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:13,958
What do you mean?

353
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,791
It'd take me forever
to explain it to you.

354
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,291
I had to let go of my
older brother's hand.

355
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:26,208
But I didn't even realize I lost grip
on the younger one's hand too.

356
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,625
Come visit me
and I will tell you everything.

357
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:35,291
Do you still remember our village?

358
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,833
I never forget anything, Grandpa.

359
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:38,833
Hey, hero, come.

360
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,375
I'll introduce you to CM Uncle.

361
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,583
- Come with me.
- No, I'm not interested. It's okay.

362
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,666
Now that you're back,

363
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,416
if you want to run the business, then
you need to know who the big players are.

364
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,666
- Come.
- I'm not interested in this game.

365
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,625
It's fine.

366
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,166
- See you later.
- Mohsin.

367
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,291
You first have to understand
the game to do that.

368
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,458
What do you want
to do with your life?

369
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,083
That's a tough question.

370
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,291
Do you have an answer to it?

371
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:04,750
Will you be able to hear it?

372
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,291
Let's see what you do.

373
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,666
You won't be able to see it either.

374
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:15,625
What are you doing, Roop?

375
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,291
Don't get into whiskey.

376
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,125
Have wine. It's good.

377
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,666
Who wrote this?

378
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,541
Everyone knows whose birthday it is.

379
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,166
It won't kill you to say hello to someone!

380
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,125
You have upset a powerful man.

381
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,166
He heard you!

382
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,250
If you want to take over the empire,

383
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,583
then you've got to change
this attitude of yours.

384
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,125
I've inherited this attitude, Varun.

385
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,500
It's in my blood.

386
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:48,958
How do I get rid of it?

387
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,291
There you two go again
with this argument!

388
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,791
Reet, I'm just trying
to explain to him that

389
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,041
if he wants to do business in India,

390
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,250
he must be mindful of every action
before he moves ahead.

391
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
How far can you see?

392
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:03,416
Can you see where our business will be in
the next five, ten, or twenty-five years?

393
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,666
Alright, we know how smart you are.
Now shut up!

394
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,458
It surprises me, Reet.

395
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,791
Even with your MBA from Harvard,
all you say is "shut up" and "stop it".

396
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,041
So sad.

397
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,375
Why, Varun?

398
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,958
Is my sister not allowed to speak up
in your house?

399
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:20,208
The point is that the CM is our guest
and we need to show him respect--

400
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,708
The point is that you're not representing
Varun Pratap Malhotra,

401
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:25,375
you're representing Swastik Steel
and Balbir Singh.

402
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,583
You don't need to bow down to them.

403
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,500
Don't talk to me like that.

404
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,625
I'm not bowing down to anybody.
He is my friend.

405
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:35,250
If he's your friend, then why does
he still have his party sash on?

406
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,958
Why didn't his security
leave their guns at the gate?

407
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:40,333
He's the Chief Minister, for crying
out loud! There are protocols to follow!

408
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,250
There is no protocol in this compound!

409
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,875
Reet, you noticed?
They have such huge guns with them.

410
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,625
What's your deal, Roop?

411
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:51,458
You're not interested in this?

412
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:52,833
Are you planning to join
the business in future

413
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,750
or will you just keep saying
"shut up" and "stop it" like her?

414
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,875
Idiot!

415
00:22:56,041 --> 00:23:00,041
That Chief Minister is going to be
the Prime Minister in the next ten years.

416
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:01,666
Then he will wait for me.

417
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,458
Champ!

418
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:07,708
When did you get back from America?

419
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,333
- Hey!
- Mishra Uncle.

420
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,041
- How are you doing?
- I'm doing great.

421
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,583
I heard you got yourself a haircut
as a gift to your father?

422
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,375
You haven't changed one bit.

423
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,625
Come on, let's grab a drink

424
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,416
and talk about your time in America.

425
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:29,333
Why just the PM,

426
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:31,416
even the American President
will be waiting for him.

427
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,750
Varun, don't instigate him.

428
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,166
Please don't do this right now.

429
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,458
What do you mean don't instigate him?

430
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,375
Why are you talking about me

431
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,541
like I'm some ticking time bomb
or something?

432
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,458
You should've said "detonate"
instead of "instigate".

433
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:46,208
I closed such a huge deal and he's trying
to teach me how to do business!

434
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:49,375
50,000 crore
and not even one single partner.

435
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,250
So, you've been tracking all this
while you were in the US?

436
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,250
What do you mean by track?

437
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,500
I didn't like the way you said "track".

438
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,083
I didn't like the way you spoke to him!

439
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,125
Whatever Varun is doing,
he's doing it for Swastik.

440
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,791
Listen, I don't want you
to defend me, okay?

441
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:01,750
- Please...
- Hey!

442
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,958
Don't interfere!

443
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,958
- What are you saying, Reet?
- Hey, Mr. Golden Spoon!

444
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,541
Why don't you just go and act
like a typical spoiled brat?

445
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,000
Travel the world, see things,

446
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,541
crash a couple of sports cars,
have some flings.

447
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:12,625
Maybe then your eyes will open up.

448
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,291
My eyes were open since I was twelve.

449
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,916
Varun, please think of the occasion.

450
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,583
- Let's please not discuss this.
- No, no, no.

451
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:20,083
Mr. Spacecraft Engineer thinks
he knows everything.

452
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,291
You belong in space.

453
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,916
Business administration isn't your thing.

454
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:27,500
You disrupted the entire ecosystem
of South India for this oil deal.

455
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,541
The world is a very
unpredictable place, Varun.

456
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:30,500
Amazing!

457
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:33,416
You're turning a positive win
into a negative.

458
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,291
You can't do business
by fearing the locals.

459
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,958
Does he know the story of the monkey

460
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,916
trying to protect the king with a sword?

461
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:46,291
There is only a monkey's difference
between bravery and stupidity.

462
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:48,166
How dare you say that?

463
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,041
- I already did, Reet.
- Shut up! Say sorry!

464
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:51,708
- Apologize to him right now!
- Tell him to apologize!

465
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,041
Are you not listening
what he is saying to me?

466
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,916
Say shut up again
and I'll shove the cake into your mouth!

467
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,208
Hey, hero, shut your--

468
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,041
Don't interfere between
me and my sister, okay?

469
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,375
Are you crazy?
Please stop it right now!

470
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,583
- Apologize right now to him.
- I won't apologize to him.

471
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:05,541
Apologize!

472
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,125
Don't be ridiculous!
I won't apologize!

473
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,500
I'll show you what's ridiculous.

474
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:26,208
I was just a kid when Reet got married.
I wasn't smart enough back then.

475
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,375
Or else, I would've never
let her marry that guy.

476
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:30,583
I never liked him.

477
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:33,041
But I'll make sure I know
the in and outs of any guy

478
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:35,250
who wants to marry you.

479
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,125
I'll organize a <i>swayamvar</i> for you, Roop.

480
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,125
There are many great guys out there,
I know some of them personally.

481
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,916
What's happening here isn't right.

482
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:47,291
If there's anything going on
between you two, finish it right away.

483
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:49,083
Trust me, if you don't listen to me...

484
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:50,833
you'll regret it.

485
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:54,666
One day, I will bring about
the end of both these brothers.

486
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,125
I'll fucking kill them both.

487
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:59,875
And it won't look good if both my sisters
mourn for their husbands

488
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,625
at such a young age.

489
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,833
Did you see how he touched her?

490
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:09,666
But there's no point saying anything now.
She's got two kids.

491
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,291
Why didn't you go
to Gitanjali's engagement party?

492
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,541
You guys were best friends
in school, right?

493
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,083
What happened?

494
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:19,375
You don't like hanging out
with middle-class people?

495
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:20,625
You only like hanging out
with such people?

496
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:23,208
- No, brother, it's not like that.
- Then what is it like?

497
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,416
Get out in the real world
and you'll understand

498
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,958
all the things your father and
grandfather have done for this country.

499
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,541
- Brother.
- Yeah?

500
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,375
Are you seriously going
to kill both of them?

501
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,708
Is there something going on
between you two?

502
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:37,916
No. There's nothing going on.

503
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:38,958
Then relax.

504
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:42,750
You started your thing
as soon as you returned!

505
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,375
You too started it again, Papa.

506
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:48,291
- Come again.
- You too started it again.

507
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:50,125
I thought you had grown up...

508
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,750
and we would sit and talk
like a father and a son.

509
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,541
But you... you called him a monkey?

510
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:57,083
Go and apologize to him.

511
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,333
You don't want to know what happened?

512
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:01,000
I already know what happened.

513
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:02,958
Then don't you think
I'm making sense, Papa?

514
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,583
We invaded Kerala.

515
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:07,333
Every big businessman in the South
sees us as an enemy now.

516
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:08,375
Papa, what I'm trying to say is--

517
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:10,750
Now you are going to teach me
how to run my own business?

518
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:12,333
Just go and apologize to him.

519
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:13,583
Right now.

520
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:15,333
I won't.

521
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,625
Ten minutes... that's all you have.

522
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:19,291
No.

523
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:21,041
Ten minutes.

524
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:38,833
Reet...

525
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,416
What happened, Reet?

526
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:42,833
Who are you trying to call?

527
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:45,041
I want to talk to Papa.

528
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:46,708
Why, what's wrong?

529
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,958
I've been calling for so long,
but he's not answering.

530
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:53,208
Okay. Tell me what happened.

531
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:59,708
They're ragging the hell out
of students in college.

532
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:01,416
I can't handle it.

533
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:02,833
What does ragging mean?

534
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:04,625
Did someone say something to you?

535
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:08,041
Did they insult you?

536
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:10,750
Did they touch you, Reet?

537
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:13,791
Did they touch you?

538
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:18,708
What will you do? They are
final-year mechanical students.

539
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:19,708
Get in, Reet.

540
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,833
Where are you going, sir?

541
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,875
You don't even have a driver's license!

542
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,208
This one?

543
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:32,333
This one?

544
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:34,916
A classic example
of heat and mass transfer

545
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,125
- would be a bullet...
- This one?

546
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:37,583
- exiting the machine gun.
- Come on.

547
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:40,166
- So, in this case--
- Ma'am, please excuse me.

548
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:43,583
Who messed with my sister?

549
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:45,666
What has life come to, man!

550
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,416
Even schoolkids think
they can question us now!

551
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,541
Ma'am, this kid is disrupting the class.

552
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:53,666
Why don't you stop him?

553
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,833
Hey, Mowgli!

554
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:57,375
Buzz off!

555
00:28:57,708 --> 00:29:00,250
I'll ask again.
Who messed with my sister?

556
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:01,750
Hey, you! Get lost!

557
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,458
Wait here, Reet.
I'll be right back.

558
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,625
Ragging season hasn't even
started yet, madam.

559
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,208
You've got a lot more to witness.

560
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:38,625
Sir, I'll tell you everything.

561
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,958
There were four guys in total.

562
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:41,458
They left after lunch.

563
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:43,875
Lokesh, Sanjiv, Karan, Dimpy.

564
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:46,916
Can you come back tomorrow, sir?
You'll find them here.

565
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,125
Do you have any idea
what you have done?

566
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:59,250
If anything like this happens in college,
you should inform me right away.

567
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,083
You shouldn't wait until
things get out of hand.

568
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,416
You think you're some kind of hero?
Are you a goon?

569
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:06,333
You fired a gun in class!
You want me to study there or not?

570
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,375
Just wait until Papa finds out about this.

571
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:09,791
That's our college, Reet.

572
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,791
What's the point if you're not safe
in our own damn college?

573
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:16,958
And to ensure your safety,
I can be anyone, let alone a goon!

574
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:20,125
Don't worry, this isn't over yet.

575
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:21,333
I'll be back tomorrow.

576
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:23,416
You don't need to be anyone for me.

577
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:29,791
Is that them?

578
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:45,291
I regret telling you about this.

579
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:47,125
Please let them go.

580
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,875
Hurry up!

581
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:00,208
Let's go!

582
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:08,458
Go faster! Come on!

583
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:15,875
Go faster!

584
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,750
Have you gone mad?

585
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:20,416
- What are you doing? Slow down!
- Reet, don't disturb me!

586
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:23,541
- Have you lost your mind?
- Let me concentrate!

587
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:30,666
{\an8}He is going to kill us!

588
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:39,166
You took a gun to college?

589
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:41,041
Have you lost your mind?

590
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:42,958
How dare you!

591
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:45,083
And then you fired the gun also?

592
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:48,583
You don't have the time to do
all this, so I didn't have a choice.

593
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:51,291
Gun, bazooka, tank...
I grabbed whatever I could.

594
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:52,333
Come again?

595
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:55,375
Gun, bazooka, tank...
I grabbed whatever--

596
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:57,916
You could have gotten arrested!

597
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,583
You could have ended up in jail!

598
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:02,833
- If I withdraw my support--
- Just do it, Papa.

599
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,125
I don't mind going to jail.

600
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:07,833
Mr. Dev Singh...

601
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,500
you got beat up because of me today.

602
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,250
I will never forget it.

603
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:14,250
Jyoti!

604
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,541
Jyoti!

605
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:18,916
We've raised a criminal!

606
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:20,416
Don't call me a criminal, Papa!

607
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:21,458
What happened?

608
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,875
And I'm sure he doesn't even care
if those boys are dead or alive!

609
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,083
They're alive.

610
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:28,083
I only did that to scare them.

611
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:30,333
Stop crying, Reet.

612
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:34,125
Tomorrow, you'll notice a distinct change
in how everyone treats you.

613
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:37,291
- Balbir, please!
- Who are you to scare them?

614
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:38,458
Who do you think
you are to scare them?

615
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:39,541
Balbir!

616
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,500
- What happened?
- You want to know what happened?

617
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:44,791
Reet has been getting bullied
in college for the past two days.

618
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:46,750
Does anyone in this house
ever know anything?

619
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:47,791
What?

620
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:50,708
Two minutes, Papa.

621
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:53,291
Forget about law and order
for just two minutes.

622
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:56,375
Do you really think I made a mistake?

623
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:58,166
You didn't make a mistake,

624
00:32:58,666 --> 00:32:59,958
you've committed a crime!

625
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,375
Reet called you on your mobile phone,

626
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,666
but you were busy.

627
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:05,583
She tried to reach you at the factory,
you were in the workshop.

628
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:07,000
You were not available, Papa.

629
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,750
After you, who is the man
in charge here?

630
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:10,291
I am.

631
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:13,208
I am responsible for everything
that happens in this house.

632
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,333
Don't ever call me a criminal, Papa.

633
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:19,541
If the son of the richest man
in the country

634
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:23,125
can't protect his sister,
then what is the use of all this?

635
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:24,416
Tell me, Papa.

636
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:25,958
What is the use of all this?

637
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:30,375
If you think what I did is a crime...

638
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:33,166
then what you're doing to me...

639
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:35,208
is also a crime.

640
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,333
Couldn't you see that Reet is upset?

641
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,875
You should've let me know!

642
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:45,291
Where the hell were you?
Get out! All of you!

643
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,666
Each one of you,
get the hell out of here!

644
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,916
No one's going anywhere!

645
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:51,458
You are the one leaving
for boarding school!

646
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:53,041
That's it.

647
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:56,375
Reet!

648
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:58,541
Next time something like this happens,

649
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:00,041
I won't just scare them...

650
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:01,958
I'll bloody kill them!

651
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,666
Balbir!

652
00:34:10,708 --> 00:34:11,958
Reet, you know
how much I love you, right?

653
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,250
I don't know that.
You just go and apologize to Varun.

654
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,375
Roop, come here.

655
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:29,875
You know how much
I love you guys, right?

656
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:31,250
I know, brother.

657
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:32,416
Come here.

658
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:35,750
- Do you trust me?
- Yes, I trust you.

659
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:41,041
Varun, I shouldn't have
talked to you like that.

660
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:43,583
I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.

661
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,416
What is going on?

662
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,541
Papa, did you say something to him?

663
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,500
Hey, did I ask you for an apology?

664
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:53,166
No, right?
This is normal in families.

665
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,541
There is no need for all this.
Papa, it's all good.

666
00:34:57,291 --> 00:34:58,250
Papa, it's okay.

667
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,416
Excuse me, Papa.

668
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:07,875
Why does he call him "Papa"?

669
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,791
Doesn't he have his own father?
He should call him "sir".

670
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:10,916
Shut up.

671
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,291
No. I can call him Papa.
He is my father, not his.

672
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,583
He is Papa for you, Reet, and me.

673
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:17,041
Papa is so strange.

674
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:18,458
He called him Papa,
and he just accepted it.

675
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:21,458
Mom, Papa, can we go
and cut the cake now?

676
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:22,666
Yes.

677
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:34,375
- Come.
- You carry on.

678
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:38,166
You know you've never been an easy child.

679
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:39,833
You've never experienced my childhood.

680
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:42,250
I'm sure I made some mistakes.

681
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,375
I didn't know how to train a son.

682
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:47,291
You trained me well, Papa.

683
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:49,375
Take care of your family

684
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:51,708
even if you have
to leave your family for it.

685
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,208
I don't need
a parenting gold medal from you.

686
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:56,041
You missed the chance
to win a gold medal.

687
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,416
I sent you away for your own good.

688
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:01,208
I sent you to learn discipline.

689
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:02,875
Let's forget all this and...

690
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,375
let's go and enjoy the party.

691
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:07,000
I know what your problem is.

692
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:08,958
Tell me what my problem is.

693
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,125
You think I'm giving your share to Varun.

694
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:12,750
Did you really mean
what you said, Papa?

695
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:15,791
Or are you saying it just to hurt me?

696
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:18,333
The fact is Varun is more disciplined.
He is capable.

697
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:19,666
He's in control.

698
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
He is hardworking.

699
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,416
Varun is someone you can never become.

700
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:25,041
Perfect.

701
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:27,833
- You think all this is a joke?
- No, of course not.

702
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,375
Varun is a good guy.

703
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:32,250
You've signed his report cards.

704
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:35,833
You taught him how to ride a bike.

705
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:38,375
Actually, Varun is your son.

706
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:39,625
I'm your bastard son.

707
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:46,041
You're brave, Papa.

708
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:49,000
You're hitting your grown-up son.

709
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,083
Forget living in the same house,

710
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,416
- we can't even live in the same country.
- Right.

711
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:54,791
Get out of my house.

712
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,916
Where are you going
with your bags all packed up?

713
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:19,833
And what did you tell her?

714
00:37:20,416 --> 00:37:22,583
They kicked her out of the house.
She called off the wedding.

715
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:26,291
You got into a fight with your family?

716
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:30,083
Did they hit you?

717
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:34,083
Are you okay?

718
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,291
You got a fever?

719
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:37,250
Are you feeling hot?

720
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,625
Come.

721
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:45,375
Kartik...

722
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:47,291
it's over, bro.

723
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,125
Ten minutes, sir.

724
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:00,625
You want some water?

725
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:03,625
You want to sit?

726
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:08,500
Hey, Gitanjali!

727
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:10,875
Congratulations on your engagement.

728
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:13,458
I'm so sorry I couldn't make it...

729
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:17,791
What?

730
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,625
Papa...

731
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:24,333
I want you to meet somebody special.

732
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:27,000
Gitanjali, come.

733
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:28,791
Come.

734
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:33,666
Papa, this is Gitanjali.

735
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:35,333
Hello, Uncle.

736
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,875
Papa...

737
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:43,791
I didn't come back
with the intention of staying here.

738
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:46,375
We are getting married, Papa.

739
00:38:49,916 --> 00:38:50,791
Papa?

740
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:53,083
Balbir?

741
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:58,250
Papa, what are you doing here?

742
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,125
Everyone is waiting
for you to cut the cake.

743
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:01,500
Come. Please.

744
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,000
Uncle, please join us.

745
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,166
What kind of example
are you setting, Gita?

746
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:18,208
What will the other kids learn from this?

747
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:19,791
You are right.

748
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:22,166
This girl didn't even think about us.

749
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:24,458
You used to call him "brother",
for crying out loud!

750
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:25,666
This is so wrong!

751
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:27,708
Sister, they cannot get married.

752
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:29,416
Gitu, I'm here!

753
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:31,208
Hello, Mom.
Hello, Papa.

754
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:33,916
Gitu, my love, you're not ready yet?

755
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,250
- What's going on?
- Hey, bro, listen.

756
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:37,333
- Come on.
- Come with us.

757
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,416
- What is it?
- Just come with us.

758
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:39,916
- What?
- Try to understand.

759
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,708
- It's a childhood love story.
- What childhood love story?

760
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:43,250
Then why did she waste my time?

761
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:44,750
What are you doing, Poonam?

762
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,583
Do you even know what you are doing?

763
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:47,958
I know, ma'am.

764
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:49,958
Earlier, that guy
was going be the groom.

765
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:51,500
Now, this guy is going to be the groom.

766
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:52,583
The groom has changed.

767
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:56,583
Gita, if this is what you wanted,
you should've told us.

768
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:57,708
And this boy--

769
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,625
We've known him since
he was a little kid.

770
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:01,333
Brother, there's no point
in discussing this.

771
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:02,625
What had to happen, has happened.

772
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,708
Gita! Talk to them!

773
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:06,458
Say something.

774
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:08,666
- Explain it to them.
- You stop talking, Kartik!

775
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:10,166
What will she explain?

776
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,541
Shameless girl!

777
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:12,666
I'm done with this.

778
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:14,166
Get up, Gita. Just get up!

779
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:55,666
<i>You touched me</i>

780
00:40:56,791 --> 00:40:59,666
<i>And I lost all control</i>

781
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:04,208
<i>My love</i>

782
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:08,375
<i>Unprecedented, like an uncharted shore</i>

783
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:10,916
<i>That kind of love</i>

784
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:14,875
<i>That kind of love</i>

785
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,458
<i>Is what my heart longs for</i>

786
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:23,666
<i>I want to love you with such intensity</i>

787
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:28,708
<i>Like I am experiencing
This craziness for the first time</i>

788
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:30,625
<i>Yes, I am!</i>

789
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:35,000
<i>Yes, I am!</i>

790
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:38,833
<i>I emerged from prayers</i>

791
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,666
<i>I am yours entirely</i>

792
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,958
<i>Yes, I am!</i>

793
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:50,375
<i>Your one and only</i>

794
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:53,083
<i>Yes, I am!</i>

795
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:54,375
<i>You didn't see
The magic unfold before your eyes</i>

796
00:42:55,250 --> 00:43:01,791
<i>Both our worlds
Came to a halt, frozen in time</i>

797
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:09,875
<i>The essence of your being
Now resides within me</i>

798
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:17,083
<i>It has just... found its place</i>

799
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:21,083
{\an8}<i>Distance between us</i>

800
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,000
<i>I cannot bear</i>

801
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:29,750
<i>My love</i>

802
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:31,916
<i>Forget the world</i>

803
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,208
<i>- And find solace in my embrace</i>
- Open your eyes.

804
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:38,666
<i>You are my guiding force
I'll be your sheltering cloud</i>

805
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,625
Kashmir?

806
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:41,500
Something like Kashmir.

807
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:46,958
<i>Away I soared in the skies</i>

808
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:52,958
<i>I emerged from prayers
I am yours entirely</i>

809
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:56,000
<i>Yes, I am!</i>

810
00:43:56,791 --> 00:44:00,791
<i>Your one and only</i>

811
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:03,000
Priest, just skip to the important stuff.

812
00:44:05,416 --> 00:44:09,666
<i>Yes, I am!</i>

813
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:27,500
What?

814
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,458
How was it?

815
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:32,208
For you?

816
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:39,416
You see, up there,
we were almost at the speed of sound.

817
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:41,708
The plane would sometimes drop.

818
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:44,708
You know, that gravitational shift?
That feeling when you're on a giant wheel?

819
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:47,583
I was on top, trying to balance.

820
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:48,958
My mind was focused on the throttle,

821
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:50,833
you were on the bottom,
nothing much for you to do.

822
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:52,416
No, see...

823
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:54,250
it was our first time.

824
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:55,791
Obviously, it was a little...

825
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,916
But the peak was...

826
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:02,250
superb, outstanding, mind-blowing.

827
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:03,333
I have no words.

828
00:45:04,291 --> 00:45:07,333
Let's do it here with gravity today,
and talk about it tomorrow?

829
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:09,583
Is this where we will be sleeping tonight?

830
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,125
Yeah.

831
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:13,291
What if anyone sees us?

832
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:16,041
Nobody's here.
It's just us. Look.

833
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:18,458
Still. What if someone does see us?

834
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:21,208
Gitanjali, this is a controlled location.

835
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:22,583
It's our private airstrip.

836
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:23,875
No one's going to see us.

837
00:45:23,958 --> 00:45:26,208
No, but you don't understand.
What if someone sees?

838
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:30,458
I'll shoot them.

839
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:32,916
You have a gun?

840
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:34,250
Yes.

841
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:35,833
You know how to shoot a gun?

842
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:38,333
You didn't ask me
if I knew how to fly a plane.

843
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:39,958
No, but you are saying you are carrying--

844
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:42,833
Gitanjali, do you want
to experience the gravity or not?

845
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:50,375
Stop...

846
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,333
Thought about kids?

847
00:45:56,708 --> 00:45:57,708
I want to be a father.

848
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:00,791
You won't be like your father, right?

849
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:05,583
What do you mean
I won't be like my father?

850
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:09,333
My father is the best father
in the world.

851
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:10,541
Please don't say that.

852
00:46:11,166 --> 00:46:12,291
Don't ever go there.

853
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:13,375
No...

854
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:17,125
- That's not what I meant--
- Gitanjali, you can ask me anything.

855
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,083
Anything dirty, like whether
I watch porn, or check out girls.

856
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:21,583
And I'll always give you
an honest answer...

857
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:22,958
but not this.

858
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:29,666
I'm sorry.

859
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:35,666
Gitanjali...

860
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,708
I will never betray you.

861
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:50,583
<i>Yes, I am!</i>

862
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,291
Bro, I've rigged the area with jammers.

863
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:00,791
No one can make any phone
or video calls for the next hour.

864
00:48:01,166 --> 00:48:02,708
I just need six minutes.
Let's bounce.

865
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:19,291
Why are we taking this entrance?

866
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:21,458
To take him by surprise.

867
00:48:41,541 --> 00:48:42,416
Sit down!

868
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,500
Close your eyes!

869
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:45,916
Close your eyes.

870
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
- Silence!
- Close your eyes.

871
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:48,041
Stay back.

872
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,166
- Close your eyes.
- Sit down.

873
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:52,166
Come on!

874
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:53,666
Sit down.

875
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:56,708
- Close your eyes.
- Close your eyes.

876
00:48:56,791 --> 00:48:57,750
- Sit down.
- Close your eyes.

877
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,708
Ladies and gentlemen...

878
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,250
we're here to do something.

879
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:09,250
It's a two-minute job
and it won't take much time...

880
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:13,166
if you just... close your eyes.

881
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:14,500
- Close your eyes.
- Close your eyes.

882
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:15,500
- Close your eyes.
- Close your eyes.

883
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:17,750
- Sit down.
- Sit. Sit down.

884
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,916
Close your eyes.

885
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,291
Uncle, do you need
a special invite or something?

886
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,958
Close your eyes.

887
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:27,166
Hurry up.

888
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,458
Brother, he's already dead.

889
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:13,166
The day Uncle got attacked,

890
00:51:13,625 --> 00:51:16,375
that same evening, he brought
them to stay at his hotel.

891
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:18,708
None of us had a clue about it.

892
00:51:20,291 --> 00:51:21,250
Where is he?

893
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:40,250
What's up with the crappy detergent here?

894
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:42,125
My underwear is all stiff
and uncomfortable.

895
00:51:42,916 --> 00:51:44,166
The texture is all messed up.

896
00:51:45,041 --> 00:51:46,791
It's very irritating.
How do you guys handle it?

897
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:50,541
- Well...
- We're just used to it, right?

898
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:53,000
Who even cares
about the texture of underwear?

899
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:57,291
It's all about comfort.

900
00:51:58,208 --> 00:51:59,166
Rubbish.

901
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:02,666
When's Freddy coming
to show us the demo?

902
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:04,500
He said tomorrow.

903
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:06,708
He always says tomorrow.
When will he show up for real?

904
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,250
Tomorrow.

905
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:15,208
Does he know his brother is dead?

906
00:52:15,583 --> 00:52:16,458
He knows.

907
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:19,666
Then he won't say a word.

908
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:36,625
Gitanjali, please.
I'm preoccupied with something else.

909
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:38,666
I'm also thinking about something else.

910
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,500
What happened to you?

911
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,041
What is this?

912
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:55,708
Do you think my love for you
has faded away?

913
00:52:57,083 --> 00:52:58,000
Then why are you wearing this?

914
00:52:58,083 --> 00:53:00,541
Or are you going
for that seven-year itch theory?

915
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,791
Is your divorced cousin
giving you relationship advice?

916
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:06,916
This is just a costume,
Gitanjali, not clothes.

917
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:09,458
You don't need it.

918
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:12,083
Don't you know me?

919
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:14,208
I'll be available, just like this,
whenever you want.

920
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:23,291
What?

921
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:26,291
Tell me, what does this mean?

922
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:27,833
What happened?

923
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:30,458
Look at the way you are saying that!

924
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:31,875
"Whenever you want!"

925
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:33,833
It means you don't want it?!

926
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:36,958
Tell me,
when was the last time we did it?

927
00:53:41,208 --> 00:53:42,166
What?

928
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:52,083
How did our life end up like this?

929
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:55,125
Our kids go to school
in a bulletproof car.

930
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:58,208
We have guards with guns
standing in the playground.

931
00:53:58,916 --> 00:54:00,583
You think normal people live like this?

932
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:02,291
We are not normal people.

933
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:03,958
After what happened at home,

934
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:06,583
sending our kids to school is not a joke.

935
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:08,875
And those are not security guards.
They're my brothers.

936
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:12,958
They left their own families
and came here to protect ours.

937
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:16,625
Dare you still call them security guards!

938
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:19,958
I feel like I've been replaced
by your cousins.

939
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:28,625
{\an8}Gitanjali, come on,
let's do it in the washroom.

940
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:31,375
The kids are asleep here.
Come on, let's do it in the washroom.

941
00:54:33,625 --> 00:54:35,458
Fine, let's do it on the sofa.
Come on.

942
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:38,791
After the conversation we had,
I'm not in the mood anymore. Got it?

943
00:54:38,958 --> 00:54:40,708
I'll change your mood in no time.
Come on.

944
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:46,541
Shall I call for the plane again?

945
00:54:49,083 --> 00:54:50,000
Is it possible?

946
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:52,333
Yeah... but what about the kids?

947
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,541
The way they're sleeping,
I doubt they'll wake up before morning.

948
00:54:57,875 --> 00:54:59,833
I can also ask Sheela
to take care of the kids.

949
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:01,291
Let's go for it.

950
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:02,708
Is this normal?

951
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:06,166
You win.

952
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:11,291
Papa!

953
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:17,208
What happened, Reet?

954
00:55:20,416 --> 00:55:22,000
Varun still hasn't returned home.

955
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:23,416
I've been trying to call him
for the past six hours,

956
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,708
but his phone's off.

957
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:26,916
Nobody knows where he is.

958
00:55:27,041 --> 00:55:29,708
I tried to contact his brother,
but his phone is also switched off.

959
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:31,875
Mom, there is no point
coming and crying here.

960
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:33,583
{\an8}Papa is fine.

961
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,125
Look at your son's confidence.

962
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:41,416
Reet, where does Varun usually hang out?

963
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:44,833
Do you know
who else he meets besides work?

964
00:55:44,916 --> 00:55:47,875
{\an8}You are not listening to me.
Why are you asking me all this?

965
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:50,083
Reet, if you know where he goes
and who he meets,

966
00:55:50,166 --> 00:55:51,916
I can send some people there to check.

967
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,208
I don't know where he goes
and who he meets.

968
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:57,875
I just know there is something
terribly wrong.

969
00:55:58,125 --> 00:55:59,500
This has never happened before.

970
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:00,541
Sister?

971
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:02,333
What happened?

972
00:56:03,458 --> 00:56:04,625
Is everything okay?

973
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:06,083
Varun hasn't come home.

974
00:56:06,666 --> 00:56:07,833
His phone's been off
for the past six hours.

975
00:56:07,916 --> 00:56:09,041
His brother's phone's off too.

976
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:10,916
That's why Reet's worried.

977
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:17,083
I don't like this!

978
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,958
We were so happy in the US.

979
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:22,500
I'm not happy here.

980
00:56:24,375 --> 00:56:26,083
Happiness is a decision, Gitanjali.

981
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,625
Shall we finish what we had started?

982
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:35,708
I don't know why we came back.

983
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:39,250
<i>The attack on Mr. Balbir Singh,</i>

984
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:42,333
<i>Chairman of Swastik Steel,
has shaken the corporate world</i>

985
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:43,875
<i>and the entire country.</i>

986
00:56:44,416 --> 00:56:48,375
<i>Unidentified attackers,
posing as schoolboys on motorcycles,</i>

987
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,666
<i>shot Mr. Balbir Singh at point-blank range</i>

988
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,375
{\an8}<i>at the Delhi Golf Course.</i>

989
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:56,958
<i>Police and agencies have not disclosed
the motive of the attack.</i>

990
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:58,500
<i>And there is no news of the attackers.</i>

991
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:00,916
<i>The Home Minister assured
the media that the assassination...</i>

992
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,833
{\an8}<i>The assassination attempt
on Mr. Balbir Singh is being investigated</i>

993
00:57:03,916 --> 00:57:05,125
{\an8}<i>at the highest levels.</i>

994
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:09,708
{\an8}<i>It has been more than 24 hours
since Mr. Balbir Singh was shot,</i>

995
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:14,125
<i>but the police have not made any arrests
and there is no news of the attackers.</i>

996
00:57:14,916 --> 00:57:16,833
<i>The Home Minister assured the media</i>

997
00:57:16,916 --> 00:57:19,416
<i>that the assassination attempt
on Mr. Balbir Singh</i>

998
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:22,291
<i>is being investigated
at the highest levels.</i>

999
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:32,625
I am Balbir Singh's son.

1000
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,541
Well, it's not like
that's written on your face!

1001
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,458
Don't do anything.

1002
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,083
So, you've finally returned?

1003
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:43,250
Papa is better now.

1004
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:45,000
Doctors are attending to him.

1005
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,041
And there are a lot of VIPs
waiting to see him.

1006
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:51,291
I'll let you know
when you can see him.

1007
00:57:54,291 --> 00:57:55,458
Go and wait downstairs.

1008
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:02,083
<i>Mr. Balbir Singh is said to be
in critical condition</i>

1009
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:04,750
<i>and is being treated at a private facility</i>

1010
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:07,041
<i>under heavy protection
of the Delhi Police.</i>

1011
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:12,250
<i>Mr. Varun Pratap Malhotra, speaking
on behalf of Mr. Balbir Singh's family</i>

1012
00:58:12,416 --> 00:58:16,500
<i>and Swastik Group of Companies,
addressed the media today morning...</i>

1013
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:24,791
You've come back now?

1014
00:58:27,083 --> 00:58:29,166
You didn't even call once
in all these years.

1015
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:33,208
You had a fight with Papa,
but you could've talked to me.

1016
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:37,750
You never called either, Reet.

1017
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,541
You stay out of it.

1018
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,958
We still haven't accepted your marriage.

1019
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:43,708
Reet, how did this happen?

1020
00:58:46,166 --> 00:58:48,875
There were two kids on a bike
wearing school uniforms.

1021
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:51,000
I got that from the news. You don't
know anything else besides that?

1022
00:58:51,416 --> 00:58:52,375
Brother.

1023
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:58,750
It's okay.

1024
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:01,041
Thank God you are back.

1025
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:04,166
My husband, Gaurav.

1026
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,875
- Hello, brother.
- Hi.

1027
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:08,791
Did you meet sir?

1028
00:59:09,125 --> 00:59:11,625
Gitanjali, when did you guys fly back?

1029
00:59:11,708 --> 00:59:13,583
- Did you meet Papa?
- There are no mafias here like in the US.

1030
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,208
This is the first time

1031
00:59:15,291 --> 00:59:18,125
such a renowned industrialist
has been shot in India, Reet.

1032
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:20,375
How is it possible
that nobody knows anything?

1033
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:23,583
Listen, don't go back
to that school incident mode.

1034
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:27,125
Remember how one mistake
completely changed your life?

1035
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:29,166
I still don't think it was a mistake.

1036
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:34,333
Hey, champ!

1037
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:35,791
Mishra Uncle.

1038
00:59:35,958 --> 00:59:37,166
What are you doing out here?

1039
00:59:38,958 --> 00:59:41,041
It's been eight years
since I laid eyes on you.

1040
00:59:41,833 --> 00:59:42,833
Did you see your father yet?

1041
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:43,791
No.

1042
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:45,458
Why not?

1043
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:47,500
Varun asked me to wait.

1044
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:50,625
Come with me.

1045
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:47,000
When did you get here?

1046
01:00:47,916 --> 01:00:49,083
This morning, Papa.

1047
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:53,833
Where have you been?

1048
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,291
The doctors were taking care of you,
so I was asked to wait.

1049
01:00:58,666 --> 01:00:59,791
Who made you wait?

1050
01:01:00,125 --> 01:01:01,041
It's okay, Papa.

1051
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:03,250
Gitanjali, come.

1052
01:01:03,416 --> 01:01:04,333
Abhay, come.

1053
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,375
Come.

1054
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:11,958
Papa, my half,
my wife, Gitanjali.

1055
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:14,208
My kids.

1056
01:01:17,125 --> 01:01:18,125
Hello, Uncle.

1057
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:20,916
Hello, dear.

1058
01:01:22,458 --> 01:01:23,416
Come, sit.

1059
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:44,083
When the first bullet hit me...

1060
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:48,208
I could hear you scream...

1061
01:01:48,958 --> 01:01:49,916
"Papa, watch out!"

1062
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:52,500
And when the second bullet hit me...

1063
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:54,208
I realized...

1064
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:56,333
I was alone.

1065
01:02:02,083 --> 01:02:03,000
Papa, I...

1066
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:05,708
I've never seen you without chest hair.

1067
01:02:06,958 --> 01:02:09,541
They must've shaved it for the surgery.

1068
01:02:10,333 --> 01:02:11,916
Even the surgeons didn't know

1069
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:16,000
whether to treat the wounds first
or shave his chest hair first.

1070
01:02:18,416 --> 01:02:20,916
It's only because he's so fit

1071
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:24,125
that he could still run even
after being hit by two bullets.

1072
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,750
Sir, please,
it's time to take rest now.

1073
01:02:29,916 --> 01:02:31,041
So, please...

1074
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:35,333
Mishra Uncle,

1075
01:02:36,125 --> 01:02:37,791
if history has taught us anything,

1076
01:02:38,166 --> 01:02:40,958
it is that anyone
can kill anyone anywhere.

1077
01:02:42,166 --> 01:02:43,791
These guards, Papa's security...

1078
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:47,125
they can blast others for money,
but they won't take a bullet for Papa.

1079
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:51,333
We keep everything
under the wrap for now.

1080
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:53,708
And I want everyone's phones tapped.

1081
01:02:55,916 --> 01:02:59,000
These workers are worried.

1082
01:03:00,208 --> 01:03:01,291
They have stopped working.

1083
01:03:21,666 --> 01:03:23,750
POWER PROGRESS VICTORY

1084
01:03:33,791 --> 01:03:35,291
My father is a strong, brave man.

1085
01:03:35,916 --> 01:03:39,333
Even after taking two bullets,
he kept his composure when I saw him.

1086
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:51,500
When someone in the family is hurt,
it pains all of us.

1087
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:55,208
I can tell all of you are anxious
and worried.

1088
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,916
That's why I felt it was important
for me, Balbir Singh's son,

1089
01:04:00,458 --> 01:04:04,666
to come here and let my Swastik family
know that Papa is safe now.

1090
01:04:07,666 --> 01:04:10,166
I want to express my gratitude

1091
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:12,250
to all of you for your love and prayers.

1092
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:19,250
I'm not here to give you a lecture.

1093
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:24,583
I'm here to assure you that I'll be back
in three months.

1094
01:04:25,458 --> 01:04:26,416
Right here.

1095
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:30,291
With my father,
so that he can meet all of you.

1096
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:37,875
Swastik Steel is the only company
where a father, a son,

1097
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,291
and a grandson work together.

1098
01:04:40,666 --> 01:04:42,375
You have proven to the world that

1099
01:04:42,458 --> 01:04:45,416
power, progress, and victory

1100
01:04:46,041 --> 01:04:47,750
aren't just words in Swastik's logo.

1101
01:04:48,708 --> 01:04:50,750
They're deeply rooted in the hearts
of the people who work for Swastik.

1102
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:53,625
Power! Progress! Victory!

1103
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:56,250
Power! Progress! Victory!

1104
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:58,833
They're deeply rooted
in every part of this company!

1105
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:01,875
<i>Power! Progress! Victory!</i>

1106
01:05:01,958 --> 01:05:04,375
Power! Progress! Victory!

1107
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:07,291
- Power! Progress! Victory!
- Now is the time...

1108
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:10,458
for those who were praying
for my father's recovery

1109
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:12,583
to get back to work.

1110
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:14,916
<i>It is time to show everyone</i>

1111
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:18,625
<i>that Swastik Group is more than
just a company. It's our home.</i>

1112
01:05:18,708 --> 01:05:22,083
If we can build bridges, roads, airports,

1113
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:25,291
and connect different countries,

1114
01:05:25,958 --> 01:05:29,375
then we can definitely track down
our enemies from any corner of the world

1115
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:30,791
and destroy them!

1116
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,833
The same hands
that construct skyscrapers...

1117
01:05:42,583 --> 01:05:44,375
the same hands that shape molten steel...

1118
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:48,250
those hands are capable
of strangling their enemies too.

1119
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:56,125
Varun, don't you have to go
to the office?

1120
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:05,333
{\an8}I promise you...

1121
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:08,791
{\an8}the person who shot my father,

1122
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:11,583
{\an8}the person who shot Balbir Singh,

1123
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:14,541
{\an8}no matter where he is hiding,

1124
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:17,333
in the sky or underground...

1125
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:20,916
{\an8}whether he is a human or a monster...

1126
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:25,125
whether it's the day hiding him
or the night...

1127
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:29,333
I promise you...

1128
01:06:31,916 --> 01:06:34,000
I will slit his throat.

1129
01:06:37,041 --> 01:06:39,708
Power! Progress! Victory!

1130
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:42,750
Power! Progress! Victory!

1131
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:45,708
- Power! Progress! Victory!

Grandma...

1148
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:40,875
you didn't recognize me?

1149

<i>A chaotic mind gradually turns you

Come, I will show you.

01:07:55,541 --> 01:07:56,916
Look at his swagger.

1154
01:07:57,125 --> 01:07:58,750
He is handsome and attractive.

1155
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,250
- We should get him married.
- Yes.

1156
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:06,291
It is true that you own two airplanes?

1157
01:08:09,041 --> 01:08:11,875
My father owns two tractors.

1158
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:13,041
- Really?
- Yes.

1159
01:08:13,458 --> 01:08:14,416
Go inside.

1160
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:17,333
Thank you, sister-in-law.

1161
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:18,541
Are you married?

1162
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:20,750
Yes.

1163
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:22,250
Got kids?

1164
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:24,041
A girl and a boy.

1165
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:25,833
You didn't invite us to the wedding.

1166
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,333
Our wedding had just two people.

1167
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:30,083
Weddings happen between two people,

1168
01:08:30,833 --> 01:08:32,791
but the family includes everyone.

1169
01:08:33,833 --> 01:08:35,291
It's been 20 years,

1170
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:40,333
and your father
hasn't even bothered to call us.

1171
01:08:42,833 --> 01:08:43,875
Hello there!

1172
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:45,791
Remember me?

1173
01:08:46,458 --> 01:08:47,791
- Jitta.
- Right.

1174
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:51,083
Paali, do you remember
when we were just small kids back then?

1175
01:08:51,916 --> 01:08:52,791
Guru...

1176
01:08:53,166 --> 01:08:55,833
Look, my buddy is all grown-up now.

1177
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:57,583
- When did you get here?
- Two days ago.

1178
01:08:58,500 --> 01:08:59,708
Where are the others?

1179
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:00,958
KP! Siddhu!

1180
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:03,458
- Come on! Look who's here!
<i>- A chaotic mind gradually turns you</i>

1181
01:09:03,541 --> 01:09:05,375

<i>- A chaotic mind gradually turns you...</i>
- What is it?

1183
01:09:08,583 --> 01:09:10,500
Why is Butta blowing up my phone
like crazy?

1184
01:09:10,958 --> 01:09:12,041
What's the problem?

1185
01:09:14,666 --> 01:09:16,875
You know who shot him yet?

1186
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,041
Greetings, Granduncle.

1187
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:28,291
God bless you, my boy.

1188
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:30,000
Who are you?

1189
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:31,541
What's going on here?

1190
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:33,458
Brother, he is Balbir Uncle's son.

1191
01:09:33,625 --> 01:09:34,750
Balbir who?

1192
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:36,166
Who is he, Grandpa?

1193
01:09:36,666 --> 01:09:38,083
Brother, Balbir Uncle.

1194
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:39,833
Balbir Singh?

1195
01:09:41,166 --> 01:09:42,375
Wasn't he shot?

1196
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:43,875
What are you doing here?

1197
01:09:43,958 --> 01:09:44,875
I need help.

1198
01:09:45,666 --> 01:09:48,083
"The Balbir Singh" needs our help?

1199
01:09:48,416 --> 01:09:49,958
What do you want from us?

1200
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:52,000
How can we help you?

1201
01:09:52,416 --> 01:09:54,916
Papa has resources and security.

1202
01:09:55,875 --> 01:09:59,208
There is nobody in the system
who wouldn't pick up his calls.

1203
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:03,416
He's got everything
except time for anyone.

1204
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:05,750
And for that, I apologize to you.

1205
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:07,541
But he is my father.

1206
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,000
And he comes before everything else,

1207
01:10:10,083 --> 01:10:12,541
I don't care if the whole world
stands or falls.

1208
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:15,500
He took two bullets, Granduncle.

1209
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:18,333
And nobody knows when or where...

1210
01:10:18,666 --> 01:10:20,041
the next bullet might come from.

1211
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:22,000
Get to the point, man.

1212
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:23,666
I want my family...

1213
01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:26,125
my brothers...

1214
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:31,000
to give me their heart,
courage, and determination.

1215
01:10:31,958 --> 01:10:35,000
I know I've come here seeking help
out of the blue

1216
01:10:35,958 --> 01:10:37,166
after all these years...

1217
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:41,041
but you all are the only ones I can ask.

1218
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:45,500
What's the plan?

1219
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:47,208
Come with me.

1220
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:48,750
To Delhi.

1221
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:50,875
Brother, when did you come?

1222
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,750
You should have informed me, guys!

1223
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:54,416
That speech was something else!

1224
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:55,750
Mind-blowing!

1225
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Everyone in college is talking about it.
My brother is a hero!

1226
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:02,166
All ties were severed years ago.

1227
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:05,083
Now, after hearing his sob story,
he expects our kids to follow him?

1228
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:07,250
When my elder brother passed away,

1229
01:11:07,833 --> 01:11:11,041
I blamed his grandpa for it.

1230
01:11:11,291 --> 01:11:13,666
His father never tried
to reach out to us.

1231
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:15,208
He could've reconnected, right?

1232
01:11:15,791 --> 01:11:18,041
You could've done that too.

1233
01:11:18,291 --> 01:11:19,458
Alright then, Father.

1234
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,333
But this boy is about to fight a battle.

1235
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,333
You think he has got what it takes?

1236
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:28,083
Son, this is a home-cooked meal.

1237
01:11:28,625 --> 01:11:30,875
I'm sure you'll like it.

1238
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:32,833
Aunty, this isn't just food,
it's a time machine.

1239
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:35,541
Took me back 25 years.

1240
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,125
Don't worry.

1241
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:39,666
Your brothers will go with you.

1242
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:41,208
Are you guys out of your minds?

1243
01:11:42,291 --> 01:11:44,916
Even monkeys have more sense
than you all!

1244
01:11:45,291 --> 01:11:48,666
He said a couple of nice things,
and now you want to follow him?

1245
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:50,333
Don't you have any pride?

1246
01:11:50,541 --> 01:11:52,416
I don't care if anyone else
wants to go with him or not,

1247
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:53,458
I'm going with him.

1248
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:54,875
Count me in too.

1249
01:11:55,166 --> 01:11:56,125
You're a fool.

1250
01:11:56,208 --> 01:11:59,291
If he wants to, he can buy
all the security in the world.

1251
01:11:59,458 --> 01:12:02,041
But, Paali, he isn't here looking
for security and power.

1252
01:12:02,125 --> 01:12:04,291
He came here looking
for his brothers' courage.

1253
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:07,250
Right! He thought about
his brothers after 20 years!

1254
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:10,333
You were inspired
by his speech too, Paali.

1255
01:12:10,416 --> 01:12:11,708
Don't make me smack you.

1256
01:12:11,791 --> 01:12:12,916
- Hey...
- Go and prepare for your exams.

1257
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:13,958
Stupid kid!

1258
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:16,916
They're just naive kids,
but you know better.

1259
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,958
Paali, personal differences don't matter

1260
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:21,208
when an outsider hurts our own.

1261
01:12:21,416 --> 01:12:23,208
The seeds we plant today

1262
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:25,125
will serve as examples
for future generations

1263
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:26,750
illustrating how brothers
stood up for one another.

1264
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:29,000
He brought three SUVs with him.

1265
01:12:29,666 --> 01:12:32,416
He expects all of us to go along.

1266
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:35,583
This is what I wanted to hear.

1267
01:12:35,666 --> 01:12:36,541
What?

1268
01:12:36,625 --> 01:12:38,500
- Dude!
- I was just messing with you guys.

1269
01:12:38,583 --> 01:12:40,250
- I'll be damned.
- I wanted to make sure you know

1270
01:12:40,333 --> 01:12:41,500
what you're getting into.

1271
01:12:42,541 --> 01:12:44,250
- You...
- Building relationships is like

1272
01:12:44,416 --> 01:12:46,000
writing on sand with sand,

1273
01:12:46,083 --> 01:12:50,166
and being true to them is like
writing on water with water.

1274
01:12:51,208 --> 01:12:54,541
And we brothers will be true to our bond
and write on water with water.

1275
01:12:54,958 --> 01:12:56,833
- Kiddo, you will miss your exams.
- Come here, my brothers.

1276
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,375
You're going to miss your exams.

1277
01:12:58,458 --> 01:12:59,583
- They happen every year.
- Were you ready for them?

1278
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:01,166
- Ready to fail.
- Then it's all good.

1279
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:28,458
Now if anyone even dares
to lay a finger on you...

1280
01:14:30,416 --> 01:14:31,625
I swear I'll set the world on fire, Papa.

1281
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:40,791
Open the gate!

1282
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:44,791
Open the fucking gate.

1283
01:14:45,333 --> 01:14:46,208
Sorry, buddy.

1284
01:14:46,416 --> 01:14:47,583
The rules have changed.

1285
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:48,791
What?

1286
01:14:52,083 --> 01:14:53,083
Do you even know who I am?

1287
01:14:53,166 --> 01:14:54,750
I'm family! Open the gate now!

1288
01:14:54,916 --> 01:14:55,833
Oh, family!

1289
01:14:56,541 --> 01:14:57,958
What's your dad's name
on the passport?

1290
01:14:58,166 --> 01:14:59,125
Balbir Singh?

1291
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:02,125
Hey! Get out!

1292
01:15:02,416 --> 01:15:03,916
<i>- What's going on, Papa?</i>
- Did the kids like their new school?

1293
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,125
<i>- My husband was asked...</i>
- They'll take some time...

1294
01:15:05,208 --> 01:15:06,208
<i>- to show his passport.</i>
- but they'll be okay.

1295
01:15:06,291 --> 01:15:07,625
<i>He is here with his old shenanigans!</i>

1296
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:09,916
- They adjusted so quickly.
<i>- Papa, can't you keep him under check?</i>

1297
01:15:10,833 --> 01:15:13,250
Mishra, why was Varun stopped at the gate?

1298
01:15:17,916 --> 01:15:20,500
Listen, you need
to end this feud between you two

1299
01:15:20,666 --> 01:15:21,750
and sort things out.

1300
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,166
Specially at this time,
when I am not a hundred percent--

1301
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:25,375
You'll be fine, Papa.

1302
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:27,708
You'll be absolutely fine.

1303
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,291
We'll discuss about Varun in detail later.

1304
01:15:30,916 --> 01:15:32,708
Paali, bring him in.

1305
01:15:34,583 --> 01:15:35,708
Papa, meet Kailash.

1306
01:15:36,625 --> 01:15:38,333
He's going to be your body double.

1307
01:15:40,458 --> 01:15:41,375
Kailash.

1308
01:15:42,791 --> 01:15:45,958
He'll talk, walk, stand,
and sit just like you.

1309
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,458
Exactly like you.

1310
01:15:48,041 --> 01:15:48,916
Sit.

1311
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,333
After detailed observations
and body scans,

1312
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:53,750
we found that this guy matches
your body type.

1313
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,916
Let's not get into the legalities of it.

1314
01:15:56,083 --> 01:15:58,416
But, Papa, nobody should know about this.

1315
01:15:59,333 --> 01:16:02,125
Mom, not even Roop or Reet.

1316
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:04,625
This duplicate will roam
freely outside as Balbir Singh,

1317
01:16:04,791 --> 01:16:06,166
while I hide at home?

1318
01:16:06,625 --> 01:16:08,041
I have so many meetings every day.

1319
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:11,333
I run an international business across
three different time zones.

1320
01:16:11,416 --> 01:16:13,375
This is impractical and dangerous.

1321
01:16:13,708 --> 01:16:15,375
He's not a duplicate,
he's a body double.

1322
01:16:15,708 --> 01:16:18,416
He won't be going everywhere.
He'll only go where I direct him.

1323
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,708
We also got teleconferencing
setup downstairs.

1324
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:22,375
You can work from home
for a few days.

1325
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:23,958
This is not a small deal.

1326
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,791
It's a very drastic step.

1327
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:31,375
He made this decision only after
consulting senior surgeons and doctors.

1328
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:37,208
It has been nine days, Papa,
and we still don't know anything.

1329
01:16:37,416 --> 01:16:39,583
Who were the attackers,
where are they, and who sent them?

1330
01:16:40,375 --> 01:16:42,875
If I knew they were in Sri Lanka,
I'd go there.

1331
01:16:43,041 --> 01:16:45,208
I'd go to Rwanda, China, wherever.

1332
01:16:45,291 --> 01:16:48,291
But we don't have a single piece
of actionable information.

1333
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:50,250
That means they have bigger plans.

1334
01:16:51,125 --> 01:16:52,583
They are not ordinary enemies, Papa.

1335
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:54,791
You should've consulted me...

1336
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:57,250
before making these plans.

1337
01:16:58,625 --> 01:17:00,125
I'll be taking care of many things
from now on, Papa.

1338
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:01,875
I can't seek your permission
for everything.

1339
01:17:03,208 --> 01:17:05,791
<i>Today's program is Sangeet Lahari.</i>

1340
01:17:06,041 --> 01:17:08,208
<i>On the sitar is Rakesh Sharma.</i>

1341
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:10,000
<i>- On the tabla is...</i>
- Hey, Sangram.

1342
01:17:10,833 --> 01:17:11,791
What's going on?

1343
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:14,125
Who are they?

1344
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:15,583
Get up, girl.

1345
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,083
Who is he?

1346
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
House owner.

1347
01:17:19,208 --> 01:17:20,541
You guys are married.

1348
01:17:21,041 --> 01:17:21,916
Don't you have any shame?

1349
01:17:22,333 --> 01:17:24,541
Manjot, I thought you were
in a serious relationship!

1350
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:26,250
Brother, I'm not involved in this.

1351
01:17:26,333 --> 01:17:27,833
Is this what you do
when your wives aren't around?

1352
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:30,750
Any of them can have
a hidden camera on them.

1353
01:17:31,416 --> 01:17:33,375
They can scan our place!
They can do anything!

1354
01:17:33,958 --> 01:17:36,250
Don't you guys have
basic threat perception?

1355
01:17:36,791 --> 01:17:38,000
Come on, get them out.

1356
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:39,208
Hey!

1357
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:41,125
Get the hell out!

1358
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:43,458
How can he talk like this?

1359
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:46,583
"Get the hell out! Leave!"

1360
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:48,333
They are our friends.

1361
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,708
Our well-wishers.

1362
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:52,458
They won't come back.

1363
01:17:52,541 --> 01:17:55,625
Do you really think
we can bring them back here?

1364
01:17:56,666 --> 01:17:58,291
Brother, don't worry about the security.

1365
01:17:58,375 --> 01:18:00,916
They're all trusted,
repeated, and personal.

1366
01:18:01,416 --> 01:18:02,583
Who all is involved in this?

1367
01:18:02,666 --> 01:18:04,458
Sangram, Sunny, and Guru.

1368
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:05,916
Then why four girls?

1369
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:07,666
Sangram needs two.

1370
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:17,208
Does your family know about this?

1371
01:18:17,291 --> 01:18:19,250
Does anyone's family
ever know about all this?

1372
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:20,666
This won't happen again.

1373
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:22,708
Don't fuck around, guys.

1374
01:18:23,875 --> 01:18:26,583
If you want, I'll stay away from my wife
too just like you guys are staying away.

1375
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,000
That will get you guys in line?

1376
01:18:29,708 --> 01:18:31,291
This used to be Grandpa's office
back in the day.

1377
01:18:31,375 --> 01:18:34,708
<i>Our best wishes to all the applicants
who sent their applications.</i>

1378
01:18:34,958 --> 01:18:36,958
<i>- That's all for today's show.</i>
- Dude...

1379
01:18:37,041 --> 01:18:38,041
Sorry, babe.

1380
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:40,458
Get out, man. Leave.

1381
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,041
Go.

1382
01:18:43,208 --> 01:18:48,791
<i>Slowly come into my life</i>

1383
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:53,083
<i>- Slowly steal my heart...</i>
- Kailash...

1384
01:18:54,458 --> 01:18:56,250
use your left hand,
not your right hand.

1385
01:18:56,333 --> 01:18:57,416
Papa uses his left hand.

1386
01:18:58,416 --> 01:19:03,500
<i>I got to tell you how much I love you</i>

1387
01:19:04,125 --> 01:19:05,458
This fucker is a funny guy.

1388
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:07,583
He's completely confused
about left and right hands.

1389
01:19:08,166 --> 01:19:09,083
What happened?

1390
01:19:09,166 --> 01:19:11,083
Papa uses his left hand to hold,
not his right hand.

1391
01:19:11,833 --> 01:19:14,458
- Come on, guys, notice all this.
<i>- Slowly come into my life</i>

1392
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,375
<i>Slowly...</i>

1393
01:19:19,416 --> 01:19:22,166
How the hell would we know
which hand Uncle uses?

1394
01:19:22,875 --> 01:19:23,875
Shut up, man.

1395
01:19:24,625 --> 01:19:25,541
Hi, Papa!

1396
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:27,625
Long time no see.

1397
01:19:28,375 --> 01:19:29,333
You are looking well.

1398
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:51,958
See you, Papa.

1399
01:20:30,416 --> 01:20:31,833
He just gave me some papers.

1400
01:20:31,916 --> 01:20:34,375
I signed them like you'd taught me.

1401
01:20:34,666 --> 01:20:38,333
Sir, can I go home for a bit?

1402
01:20:38,541 --> 01:20:39,583
I'll let you know, Kailash.

1403
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:41,333
Okay?

1404
01:21:49,833 --> 01:21:50,750
Stop.

1405
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,291
Pull!

1406
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:23,541
Sir, I'm not...

1407
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:17,541
<i>Whether known or not by you</i>

1408
01:23:18,333 --> 01:23:25,333
<i>I understand the heart's blues</i>

1409
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:33,291
<i>God alone knows its deepest hues</i>

1410
01:23:35,041 --> 01:23:42,041
<i>I've always prayed
For your well-being, it's true</i>

1411
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:56,458
<i>I've always prayed
For your well-being, it's true</i>

1412
01:23:56,583 --> 01:23:59,708
I told you to take out both
the father and the son.

1413
01:24:00,208 --> 01:24:01,916
You don't call the shots around here.

1414
01:24:02,041 --> 01:24:03,916
<i>We were only supposed
to kill Balbir, and we did it.</i>

1415
01:24:04,583 --> 01:24:06,625
Don't call on the phone.
Use the app.

1416
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:09,458
You were right. It's a live call.

1417
01:24:10,583 --> 01:24:12,500
Balbir is alive.

1418
01:24:12,583 --> 01:24:13,708
No. No way.

1419
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:15,541
It's impossible!

1420
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:17,458
The man you killed
was his body double.

1421
01:24:17,833 --> 01:24:18,708
Body double?

1422
01:24:18,916 --> 01:24:20,375
Where did this body double
even come from?

1423
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,250
<i>His son made one.</i>

1424
01:24:22,333 --> 01:24:23,958
<i>All of this was happening
right in your house,</i>

1425
01:24:24,041 --> 01:24:25,458
and you had no clue about it?!

1426
01:24:25,958 --> 01:24:27,166
<i>You had one simple job!</i>

1427
01:24:27,416 --> 01:24:30,625
<i>You think planning
and executing all this is easy?</i>

1428
01:24:31,041 --> 01:24:32,333
What should I tell my brother?

1429
01:24:32,791 --> 01:24:34,000
That you screwed up?

1430
01:24:34,125 --> 01:24:37,083
As long as he's around,
we can't get to Balbir.

1431
01:24:37,291 --> 01:24:38,833
How many more
Balbirs has this guy made?

1432
01:24:38,916 --> 01:24:40,500
<i>Asrar, listen to me.</i>

1433
01:24:40,583 --> 01:24:43,666
<i>You kill the son, and I'll kill the father
in his own house.</i>

1434
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:31,666
Prateek!

1435
01:25:33,333 --> 01:25:34,208
Kairan!

1436
01:25:36,166 --> 01:25:37,041
What's this?

1437
01:25:38,458 --> 01:25:40,875
This is my special handcrafted underwear.

1438
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:44,041
It's got a thousand threads
packed into every square inch.

1439
01:25:44,666 --> 01:25:45,583
Feel it.

1440
01:25:46,791 --> 01:25:49,541
It's not like your regular underwear
with a long trunk.

1441
01:25:49,958 --> 01:25:52,250
It shapes itself to whatever it holds.

1442
01:25:52,791 --> 01:25:56,708
And your crappy detergent
ruined my underwear!

1443
01:25:57,375 --> 01:25:58,291
What happened?

1444
01:25:58,458 --> 01:26:00,333
What happened?!
I've got a rash down there!

1445
01:26:00,708 --> 01:26:01,708
A rash? Let me see.

1446
01:26:01,791 --> 01:26:03,583
It's okay. Show me.

1447
01:26:03,666 --> 01:26:05,375
Are you crazy? You want me
to show it in front of everyone?

1448
01:26:05,625 --> 01:26:07,333
Don't worry, they will close their eyes.
Come on, show.

1449
01:26:07,458 --> 01:26:09,083
- Gitanjali, do you really--
- What happened, sir?

1450
01:26:09,166 --> 01:26:10,041
Come here.

1451
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:14,583
Sir, we use fabric softener

1452
01:26:14,666 --> 01:26:16,583
- that makes clothes soft, even innerwear.
- Shut up!

1453
01:26:17,083 --> 01:26:18,458
Go, put this on.

1454
01:26:19,333 --> 01:26:20,208
Go!

1455
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:23,416
What happened, sister-in-law?

1456
01:26:24,166 --> 01:26:26,125
Your brother is
in full jolly mood today.

1457
01:26:26,833 --> 01:26:27,708
Jolly mood?

1458
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:29,500
I've got a rash.

1459
01:26:29,625 --> 01:26:31,416
I can't sit or stand properly.

1460
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,000
I've been doing splits all day.

1461
01:26:33,791 --> 01:26:34,708
Sir...

1462
01:26:34,875 --> 01:26:35,916
Lift it up.

1463
01:26:36,916 --> 01:26:39,000
Sir... it hurts.

1464
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:42,583
Don't be so dramatic, okay?

1465
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:45,000
Did you shave?

1466
01:26:47,291 --> 01:26:48,208
Yes, sir.

1467
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:50,166
God didn't give you
any hair on your head...

1468
01:26:50,875 --> 01:26:52,083
and you're shaving off
what you got down there.

1469
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:53,250
Have some sense.

1470
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:56,000
God gave you hair down there
for a reason, right?

1471
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:58,291
Why are you shaving it off?
Did your girlfriend ask you to?

1472
01:26:58,791 --> 01:27:00,375
- Did your doctor ask you to?
- Listen...

1473
01:27:00,583 --> 01:27:03,000
Why do you shave it off?
It's a natural process. Let it grow.

1474
01:27:03,458 --> 01:27:05,833
Listen, just give me one day.

1475
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:08,875
By tomorrow, you will have
365 new pairs of underwear.

1476
01:27:09,541 --> 01:27:10,416
Okay?

1477
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:11,916
Don't wear anything today.

1478
01:27:12,583 --> 01:27:13,458
Yeah...

1479
01:27:15,083 --> 01:27:16,708
Brother, you got us all suited up...

1480
01:27:17,208 --> 01:27:18,291
and you're rocking a kurta and lungi?

1481
01:27:20,708 --> 01:27:21,875
Who is the main guy?

1482
01:27:25,958 --> 01:27:26,833
Freddy.

1483
01:27:32,125 --> 01:27:34,708
You're the one who talked
to our engineer on the phone?

1484
01:27:35,791 --> 01:27:36,708
What a vision!

1485
01:27:38,208 --> 01:27:39,208
What a thought!

1486
01:27:39,708 --> 01:27:40,958
My team is going crazy.

1487
01:27:43,208 --> 01:27:44,708
Let's get straight to the point.

1488
01:27:44,791 --> 01:27:47,208
These guys are no saints.

1489
01:27:47,416 --> 01:27:49,541
They got no history.

1490
01:27:49,625 --> 01:27:52,416
Clean, loaded, no record.

1491
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:53,791
Skip the details, bro.

1492
01:27:53,875 --> 01:27:55,708
- Just show us a demo of this beauty.
- Hey!

1493
01:27:55,833 --> 01:27:56,875
- Hey!
- Hey!

1494
01:27:57,291 --> 01:27:58,458
Never put your hand on my shoulder!

1495
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:02,958
Never touch my shoulder.

1496
01:28:06,916 --> 01:28:09,166
I'm not here
to show you some damn toy!

1497
01:28:10,666 --> 01:28:11,666
Don't cross the line.

1498
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,666
Freaking dimwits.

1499
01:28:14,916 --> 01:28:16,916
All they have is money.

1500
01:28:17,416 --> 01:28:19,875
They got no discipline or manners.

1501
01:28:21,125 --> 01:28:22,000
Look at how he's acting, asshole.

1502
01:28:22,083 --> 01:28:23,833
- Hey!
- Hey!

1503
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:27,083
Keep quiet.

1504
01:28:27,625 --> 01:28:30,083
Sir, they know you're cursing at them.

1505
01:28:30,166 --> 01:28:31,416
They should.

1506
01:28:31,791 --> 01:28:32,958
He had the guts to touch Freddy.

1507
01:28:37,291 --> 01:28:40,041
I usually don't make deliveries in person.

1508
01:28:40,416 --> 01:28:42,750
I came here, especially for that man.

1509
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:43,958
The man...

1510
01:28:45,125 --> 01:28:48,500
who briefed my team about this machine.

1511
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:49,750
Freddy, please continue.

1512
01:28:50,833 --> 01:28:54,125
Your guys think
I'm some kind of food delivery guy.

1513
01:28:55,541 --> 01:28:56,625
I'm a man of force!

1514
01:29:01,791 --> 01:29:04,750
Brother! Where are you?

1515
01:29:07,125 --> 01:29:08,958
I don't even bloody know your name.

1516
01:29:12,583 --> 01:29:14,208
As soon as you know
shit's about to go down,

1517
01:29:14,291 --> 01:29:17,375
the first thing you have to do is keep
your family jewels safe and secure.

1518
01:29:17,541 --> 01:29:19,583
If you don't wear a tight supporter
or underwear,

1519
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:21,291
they're going
to get beaten around like a drum.

1520
01:29:21,708 --> 01:29:25,916
If the action happens indoors,
then headphones are a must.

1521
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,750
For the ones with turbans,
use earbuds. Okay?

1522
01:29:29,708 --> 01:29:31,833
Good. Now coming to this...

1523
01:29:44,583 --> 01:29:46,833
Put on your headphones.
Move! Move fast!

1524
01:29:47,166 --> 01:29:48,250
Fast! Fast! Fast!

1525
01:29:50,958 --> 01:29:51,875
Freddy, give me your underwear.

1526
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:54,208
- Hand me your underwear.
- What?

1527
01:29:54,416 --> 01:29:56,750
I'm not wearing one. I got to go outside.
Do you understand?

1528
01:29:56,833 --> 01:29:57,916
- Do you want me to show you?
- Hey!

1529
01:29:59,541 --> 01:30:00,416
What...

1530
01:30:01,791 --> 01:30:02,791
what are you going show me?

1531
01:30:03,083 --> 01:30:05,000
You want me
to show you my "black"?

1532
01:30:05,125 --> 01:30:06,041
Hey, come here.

1533
01:30:07,458 --> 01:30:08,583
What is the name of your boss?

1534
01:30:13,333 --> 01:30:17,041
<i>Hey, bring it on, baby!</i>

1535
01:30:27,875 --> 01:30:28,791
Hey!

1536
01:30:32,708 --> 01:30:34,125
This is how you fucking shoot!

1537
01:30:35,041 --> 01:30:36,875
<i>The discussion is getting dull</i>

1538
01:30:37,416 --> 01:30:41,541
<i>It's time to celebrate
Let's head to the square, my buddy</i>

1539
01:30:41,791 --> 01:30:44,041
<i>There are drinks hidden
Come on, let's get rowdy</i>

1540
01:30:44,125 --> 01:30:46,375
<i>Brother, grab some appetizers too</i>

1541
01:30:46,458 --> 01:30:50,833
<i>Pintya, it's time for crazy disco dancing
Me and you</i>

1542
01:30:50,916 --> 01:30:55,125
<i>- Hey, Dolby-guy, call for the DJ
- Call for the DJ</i>

1543
01:30:55,208 --> 01:30:59,625
<i>- Hey, Dolby-guy, call for the DJ
- Call for the DJ</i>

1544
01:30:59,708 --> 01:31:04,041
<i>- Hey, Dolby-guy, call for the DJ
- Call for the DJ</i>

1545
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:08,500
<i>- Hey, Dolby-guy, call for the DJ
- Voice it up one time!</i>

1546
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:10,750
<i>Bounce the music
I am a get all-round</i>

1547
01:31:10,833 --> 01:31:12,958
<i>Heat it up on the beat up the sound</i>

1548
01:31:18,916 --> 01:31:22,041
That fellow took my headphones as well.

1549
01:31:22,375 --> 01:31:23,500
- Sir!
- Hey!

1550
01:31:25,083 --> 01:31:29,291
- Sir, you want my underwear?
- What?

1551
01:31:29,375 --> 01:31:31,666
<i>He keeps playing peppy songs</i>

1552
01:31:31,833 --> 01:31:36,750
<i>Brother fills his glass
And goes bottoms up once more</i>

1553
01:31:41,666 --> 01:31:43,375
<i>DJ is in the mood now</i>

1554
01:31:43,458 --> 01:31:46,041
<i>He keeps playing peppy songs
For us to rock the dance floor</i>

1555
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:50,333
<i>Brother fills his glass
And goes bottoms up once more</i>

1556
01:31:50,583 --> 01:31:52,916
<i>He's recharged and ready
Feeling the dance floor</i>

1557
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,083
<i>Now he's playing lezim with great zest</i>

1558
01:31:55,166 --> 01:31:57,291
<i>Pintya sits tired, needing some rest</i>

1559
01:31:57,375 --> 01:31:59,916
<i>But brother pulls him back
Doesn't let him go</i>

1560
01:32:00,125 --> 01:32:01,458
<i>He kicked him then...</i>

1561
01:32:04,291 --> 01:32:06,958
<i>- He said we are friends forever...</i>
- Balli! How many left?

1562
01:32:07,041 --> 01:32:08,750
<i>- Like the drum and the cymbals</i>
- Fourteen.

1563
01:32:08,833 --> 01:32:11,125
- Stay focused.
<i>- We are meant to be together</i>

1564
01:32:11,208 --> 01:32:15,500
<i>- Hey, Dolby-guy...
- Call for the DJ</i>

1565
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:19,916
<i>- Hey, Dolby-guy...
- Call for the DJ</i>

1566
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,625
<i>- Hey, Dolby-guy...
- Call for the DJ</i>

1567
01:32:24,708 --> 01:32:28,833
<i>Hey, Dolby-guy, call for the DJ</i>

1568
01:32:28,916 --> 01:32:33,250
<i>- Hey, Dolby-guy, call for the DJ
- Come on!</i>

1569
01:32:33,333 --> 01:32:37,375
<i>- Hey, Dolby-guy, call for the DJ
- Come on!</i>

1570
01:32:37,458 --> 01:32:41,000
<i>- Hey, Dolby-guy, call for the DJ</i>
- Royal!

1571
01:33:16,333 --> 01:33:18,625
<i>Brother, come on, feel the dance floor</i>

1572
01:33:18,708 --> 01:33:21,166
<i>Brother, let's do the lezim!</i>

1573
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:22,708
<i>Oh, brother!
You're useless</i>

1574
01:33:58,958 --> 01:34:00,083
You guys done with the first aid?

1575
01:34:01,041 --> 01:34:01,916
Yeah.

1576
01:34:02,125 --> 01:34:03,875
Paali, call Mishra Uncle...

1577
01:34:04,916 --> 01:34:07,666
and tell him to send an air ambulance,
or we'll be stuck in traffic.

1578
01:34:16,666 --> 01:34:17,666
Relax, guys.

1579
01:34:21,791 --> 01:34:22,708
Jitta.

1580
01:34:23,583 --> 01:34:24,541
Fold this up for me, will you?

1581
01:34:30,916 --> 01:34:32,958
Brother, there are too many of them!

1582
01:34:49,833 --> 01:34:55,250
<i>Arjan, the fearless...</i>

1583
01:34:55,791 --> 01:34:59,833
<i>- With this, it started a fight...
- Go for it!</i>

1584
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:05,500
<i>With this, it started a fight
On the battlefield</i>

1585
01:35:05,583 --> 01:35:07,916
<i>Arjan, the fearless...</i>

1586
01:35:08,458 --> 01:35:10,375
<i>Arjan, the fearless</i>

1587
01:35:10,458 --> 01:35:13,500
<i>Folded his legs and hit the axe
With full strength and anger</i>

1588
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:15,083
<i>Arjan, the fearless</i>

1589
01:35:15,166 --> 01:35:20,166
<i>Folded his legs and hit the axe
With full strength and anger</i>

1590
01:35:33,833 --> 01:35:39,375
<i>Warriors adorned in gleaming armor
And clutching razor-sharp swords</i>

1591
01:35:39,458 --> 01:35:40,333
<i>Go for it!</i>

1592
01:35:40,416 --> 01:35:43,541
<i>Warriors adorned in gleaming armor
And clutching razor-sharp swords</i>

1593
01:35:43,625 --> 01:35:44,916
<i>Met with thunderous clash</i>

1594
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,458
<i>On this battlefield
Jatts are fighting like bulls</i>

1595
01:35:47,875 --> 01:35:49,958
<i>On this battlefield
Jatts are fighting like bulls</i>

1596
01:35:50,041 --> 01:35:52,666
<i>Truly there is no peace at all</i>

1597
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:58,416
<i>The brutality of battlefield will...</i>

1598
01:36:02,208 --> 01:36:07,083
<i>The brutality of battlefield will destroy
The world of Bachno</i>

1599
01:36:07,166 --> 01:36:08,625
<i>Arjan, the fearless</i>

1600
01:36:08,708 --> 01:36:11,791
<i>Folded his legs and hit the axe
With full strength and anger</i>

1601
01:36:11,916 --> 01:36:13,500
<i>Arjan, the fearless</i>

1602
01:36:13,583 --> 01:36:18,583
<i>Folded his legs and hit the axe
With full strength and anger</i>

1603
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:33,416
This is no fun, Manjot!

1604
01:36:34,958 --> 01:36:36,041
Pass me the axe!

1605
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:52,458
<i>At the height of the battle
The tips of swords clashed and tangled</i>

1606
01:36:52,541 --> 01:36:55,125
<i>Their gleaming edges entwined
In a deadly dance of conflict</i>

1607
01:36:55,291 --> 01:36:57,166
<i>Amidst the brutal chaos of the battlefield</i>

1608
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:59,750
<i>Blood flowed upon the earth
Like water from a shattered earthen pot</i>

1609
01:36:59,833 --> 01:37:02,333
<i>A valiant warrior found that his friends...</i>

1610
01:37:02,458 --> 01:37:05,000
<i>- Go for it!
- A valiant warrior found that his friends</i>

1611
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:07,916
<i>Stood resolutely by his side like lions
On the battlefield</i>

1612
01:37:08,041 --> 01:37:09,666
<i>Arjan, the fearless</i>

1613
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:12,750
<i>Folded his legs and hit the axe
With full strength and anger</i>

1614
01:37:12,833 --> 01:37:14,333
<i>Arjan, the fearless</i>

1615
01:37:14,416 --> 01:37:19,375
<i>Folded his legs and hit the axe
With full strength and anger</i>

1616
01:37:25,291 --> 01:37:30,041
<i>A roar echoed all around...</i>

1617
01:37:31,416 --> 01:37:33,416
<i>A roar echoed all around</i>

1618
01:37:33,583 --> 01:37:36,375
<i>When he hit the axe bravely</i>

1619
01:37:36,458 --> 01:37:39,250
<i>When he hit the axe bravely</i>

1620
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:41,375
<i>A roar echoed all around</i>

1621
01:37:41,458 --> 01:37:44,166
<i>When he hit the axe bravely</i>

1622
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:48,958
<i>Bloodshed continues
When the throats of people are twisted</i>

1623
01:37:49,041 --> 01:37:51,708
<i>The majesty of Jatt is like a lion</i>

1624
01:37:52,083 --> 01:37:53,916
<i>The majesty of Jatt is like a lion</i>

1625
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,000
<i>Who always keep the government authority
Under his control</i>

1626
01:37:57,083 --> 01:37:58,625
<i>Arjan, the fearless</i>

1627
01:37:58,708 --> 01:38:01,791
<i>Folded his legs and hit the axe
With full strength and anger</i>

1628
01:38:01,916 --> 01:38:03,416
<i>Arjan, the fearless</i>

1629
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:09,541
<i>Folded his legs and hit the axe
With full strength and anger</i>

1630
01:38:14,291 --> 01:38:15,208
Brother!

1631
01:38:15,291 --> 01:38:17,458
I just saw 200 men storming in
from the back entrance!

1632
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:03,250
Boys!

1633
01:39:03,958 --> 01:39:05,708
Imagined in Delhi.

1634
01:39:07,291 --> 01:39:09,166
Manufactured in Bangalore.

1635
01:39:11,125 --> 01:39:13,000
Assembled in Maharashtra.

1636
01:39:14,916 --> 01:39:18,000
Hundred percent made in India.

1637
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:25,333
Self-reliant India.

1638
01:39:29,458 --> 01:39:32,375
Come on, get on to it.

1639
01:39:32,458 --> 01:39:36,166
Press the button,
shift the gear, and drive off.

1640
01:39:36,666 --> 01:39:40,291
All is well!

1641
01:40:41,375 --> 01:40:43,416
<i>When I went seeking evil</i>

1642
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:46,166
<i>I could not find any evil</i>

1643
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:49,291
<i>When I looked within</i>

1644
01:40:50,083 --> 01:40:52,041
<i>There was no one more evil than me</i>

1645
01:42:51,666 --> 01:42:52,625
Paali!

1646
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:55,083
Manjot, Siddhu, Royal!

1647
01:42:57,375 --> 01:43:00,166
Make sure I didn't miss anyone!

1648
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:06,875
Yes!

1649
01:43:07,166 --> 01:43:08,333
Fuck you!

1650
01:43:46,333 --> 01:43:47,541
{\an8}Brother, I think it's his brother.

1651
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,708
{\an8}<i>Asrar, where are you?</i>

1652
01:43:51,666 --> 01:43:55,000
You have called to check
if the job has been done, right?

1653
01:43:55,083 --> 01:43:56,000
<i>Asrar?</i>

1654
01:43:56,791 --> 01:43:58,250
I'm still alive.

1655
01:43:58,583 --> 01:44:02,583
{\an8}Now you don't need to come after me.
I'll come for you.

1656
01:44:03,375 --> 01:44:05,333
Whatever you hold dear...

1657
01:44:05,916 --> 01:44:08,083
whether it's your wife, your kids,

1658
01:44:08,166 --> 01:44:11,000
your parents, your job, or your home,

1659
01:44:11,083 --> 01:44:12,958
I'm going to ruin it all.

1660
01:44:13,333 --> 01:44:18,416
{\an8}And your brother was eager
to know my name, right?

1661
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,500
My name is Rannvijay Singh Balbir.

1662
01:44:30,333 --> 01:44:31,875
Now you listen to this.

1663
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:44,458
I'll be damned!

1664
01:44:45,875 --> 01:44:46,833
Boys!

1665
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:49,833
Salute the champion!

1666
01:45:12,875 --> 01:45:15,041
I cannot give you
a one-line answer, Balbir...

1667
01:45:15,625 --> 01:45:18,666
and I cannot give you commitment
until we have more information.

1668
01:45:19,375 --> 01:45:21,541
The most important thing right now

1669
01:45:21,666 --> 01:45:24,041
is that he has to come out of the coma,

1670
01:45:24,416 --> 01:45:27,791
only then can we decide
what to do next.

1671
01:46:12,791 --> 01:46:14,041
Jitta...

1672
01:46:16,458 --> 01:46:20,000
Did you find out who they were?

1673
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:21,833
No.

1674
01:46:52,416 --> 01:46:53,791
I can't hear anything.

1675
01:46:54,791 --> 01:46:56,333
I can't hear anything, Papa.

1676
01:46:56,416 --> 01:46:58,333
It's like the sound's turned off.
I can't hear anything.

1677
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:32,833
I told you not to fidget with the levels.

1678
01:47:35,875 --> 01:47:37,583
Have you found any information
regarding the hotel attack?

1679
01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:39,125
No, brother.

1680
01:47:39,208 --> 01:47:42,375
Do you have any info on the guy
I shot after sticking a gun in his mouth?

1681
01:47:42,625 --> 01:47:45,083
I am trying.
His phone is encrypted.

1682
01:47:45,833 --> 01:47:47,916
How the hell did 300 people
walk into our hotel?

1683
01:47:48,166 --> 01:47:49,458
And we don't know anything
about them?

1684
01:47:51,291 --> 01:47:54,791
Doctors, whatever you told me,

1685
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,250
tell him everything honestly.

1686
01:47:56,541 --> 01:47:59,083
Don't worry, my son is a tough guy.
He'll take it.

1687
01:47:59,416 --> 01:48:00,291
Papa...

1688
01:48:02,333 --> 01:48:05,458
Vijay, we are the group of doctors
who have been treating you so far.

1689
01:48:06,083 --> 01:48:08,291
We would like to brief you
on the future course of action.

1690
01:48:10,166 --> 01:48:11,791
Six gunshot wounds,

1691
01:48:12,125 --> 01:48:13,375
deep wounds in the back,

1692
01:48:13,458 --> 01:48:15,041
multiple concussions to the head.

1693
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:18,416
Because your adrenal was so high,
you couldn't feel it.

1694
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:20,166
None of us thought you would live.

1695
01:48:20,541 --> 01:48:22,250
But we are glad
to see you sitting like this.

1696
01:48:22,458 --> 01:48:25,875
You've lost your sense of taste
and smell because of the concussions.

1697
01:48:26,083 --> 01:48:29,083
One bullet hit in your chest area
very close to your heart,

1698
01:48:29,166 --> 01:48:31,458
one punctured the lower lobe
of your left lung,

1699
01:48:31,708 --> 01:48:34,500
and we've removed one bullet
from your lower abdomen

1700
01:48:34,750 --> 01:48:36,125
which has impacted your bladder.

1701
01:48:36,375 --> 01:48:38,125
Your urinary function has failed,

1702
01:48:38,458 --> 01:48:40,333
that's why they
had to stick in a catheter.

1703
01:48:40,791 --> 01:48:42,333
Catheter? You mean a silicone pipe?

1704
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:44,125
Up my penis?

1705
01:48:44,375 --> 01:48:45,250
Yes.

1706
01:48:45,333 --> 01:48:48,666
A 45 cm silicone pipe
was inserted through your penis

1707
01:48:48,750 --> 01:48:51,708
so that you can drain
your urine into a bag.

1708
01:48:51,791 --> 01:48:54,458
They shaved me
and they didn't even ask.

1709
01:48:55,083 --> 01:48:56,500
It's a surgical procedure.

1710
01:48:56,791 --> 01:48:57,666
Sure.

1711
01:48:58,833 --> 01:48:59,916
You've turned into a doctor now.

1712
01:49:00,333 --> 01:49:01,291
Mishra Uncle,

1713
01:49:01,541 --> 01:49:03,583
everyone becomes a doctor as soon
as someone at home gets sick.

1714
01:49:04,083 --> 01:49:05,625
Most importantly, Vijay...

1715
01:49:06,791 --> 01:49:08,041
your heart is failing.

1716
01:49:08,333 --> 01:49:10,541
You mean I'm going to die.
Don't beat around the bush.

1717
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:14,666
If there's something wrong with my heart,
then find me a donor.

1718
01:49:15,208 --> 01:49:19,083
Mr. Vijay, your name has been approved
for the donor list.

1719
01:49:19,708 --> 01:49:22,291
But finding a donor is not an easy task.

1720
01:49:22,458 --> 01:49:23,500
And even if we find one,

1721
01:49:23,583 --> 01:49:27,958
there's always a chance
your body rejects the new heart.

1722
01:49:28,083 --> 01:49:30,541
A lot of things
have to go right for this to work.

1723
01:49:30,875 --> 01:49:33,416
Unfortunately, the success rate
is only one percent.

1724
01:49:37,625 --> 01:49:39,750
Papa, I'm going to be okay.

1725
01:49:40,833 --> 01:49:42,208
Mom...

1726
01:49:42,791 --> 01:49:43,666
Gitanjali...

1727
01:49:44,791 --> 01:49:46,708
Confidence is medicine but...

1728
01:49:46,958 --> 01:49:48,291
I have confidence in myself.

1729
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:50,208
I will be fine.

1730
01:49:51,791 --> 01:49:52,750
Excuse me.

1731
01:49:53,958 --> 01:49:55,750
I noticed you taking notes.

1732
01:49:56,083 --> 01:49:56,958
Who are you?

1733
01:49:57,166 --> 01:49:58,541
Sir, I'm Dr. Amrita.

1734
01:49:58,958 --> 01:50:00,166
I'm a psychologist.

1735
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,250
I'm here for your mental well-being
and your morale.

1736
01:50:04,458 --> 01:50:05,916
This is the only thing
working properly right now.

1737
01:50:07,458 --> 01:50:08,833
We don't need you.
You may leave.

1738
01:50:09,291 --> 01:50:10,916
You are young, married.

1739
01:50:11,666 --> 01:50:13,041
This has affected a lot of things.

1740
01:50:13,583 --> 01:50:15,416
Things will not go back
to the way they were.

1741
01:50:16,083 --> 01:50:18,291
Sir, we can do this evaluation one-on-one.

1742
01:50:18,541 --> 01:50:20,625
- There'll be a lot of personal questions--
- It's okay, it's okay.

1743
01:50:20,750 --> 01:50:22,125
They are my cousins and my family.

1744
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:23,958
You can start.

1745
01:50:26,208 --> 01:50:28,875
The evaluation begins
with your sex life.

1746
01:50:29,208 --> 01:50:30,125
Are you sure?

1747
01:50:31,416 --> 01:50:32,375
Go for it.

1748
01:50:33,541 --> 01:50:34,416
Okay.

1749
01:50:34,750 --> 01:50:36,958
How often were you intimate
with your wife?

1750
01:50:38,166 --> 01:50:40,458
In a day, week, overall?

1751
01:50:40,625 --> 01:50:41,541
Be specific.

1752
01:50:41,875 --> 01:50:42,791
In a week, sir.

1753
01:50:43,416 --> 01:50:44,500
How often do you do it?

1754
01:50:46,208 --> 01:50:47,125
Sorry?

1755
01:50:49,208 --> 01:50:51,416
How often do you do it in a week?

1756
01:50:54,625 --> 01:50:57,041
I'm sorry we are not supposed
to answer these questions.

1757
01:50:57,166 --> 01:51:00,416
I'm asking because comparisons
give us a point of reference, right?

1758
01:51:01,416 --> 01:51:02,541
I'm making your job easy.

1759
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:06,125
Sir, my job is to ask questions,
not give answers.

1760
01:51:06,625 --> 01:51:07,708
Could you just tell me?

1761
01:51:13,958 --> 01:51:16,041
My number will scare you.

1762
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:21,375
I think I've already overcompensated.

1763
01:51:21,916 --> 01:51:24,875
We are good even if we don't do it
for the next five years.

1764
01:51:25,375 --> 01:51:26,458
Right, Gitanjali?

1765
01:51:28,333 --> 01:51:30,791
See, I managed
to lighten everyone's mood.

1766
01:51:31,458 --> 01:51:32,458
You guys can leave now.

1767
01:51:40,666 --> 01:51:41,583
Papa?

1768
01:51:41,916 --> 01:51:42,875
No, Reet.

1769
01:51:43,208 --> 01:51:45,166
I'm using this office these days.

1770
01:51:45,791 --> 01:51:46,708
What happened?

1771
01:51:48,666 --> 01:51:50,666
Where's Papa?
I want to talk to him.

1772
01:51:51,125 --> 01:51:52,875
Papa is busy with my doctors.

1773
01:51:53,208 --> 01:51:55,083
Tell me what's wrong.

1774
01:51:56,208 --> 01:51:58,166
I want to talk to Papa. I'll wait.

1775
01:52:01,208 --> 01:52:02,500
I killed Varun.

1776
01:52:08,291 --> 01:52:09,708
What did you do?!

1777
01:52:11,666 --> 01:52:14,375
Reet, Varun was directly involved

1778
01:52:14,458 --> 01:52:16,416
in the assassination attempt
on our father.

1779
01:52:18,458 --> 01:52:20,125
He tried to kill me too.

1780
01:52:21,041 --> 01:52:24,708
You'll stop crying
once it sinks in your brain.

1781
01:52:27,458 --> 01:52:29,125
- Gitanjali!
- Yeah...

1782
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:32,291
Why the hell do they keep giving me
these small urine bags?

1783
01:52:32,541 --> 01:52:33,625
Order the bigger ones.

1784
01:52:33,708 --> 01:52:34,958
They only come in one size.

1785
01:52:35,666 --> 01:52:37,791
- I'll... I'll get them.
- Tell Sheela to get some towels.

1786
01:52:39,458 --> 01:52:40,416
Sheela!

1787
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:42,041
It's okay, Reet.
It's just urine.

1788
01:52:44,875 --> 01:52:45,916
Where's his body?

1789
01:52:46,625 --> 01:52:47,583
Got rid of it.

1790
01:52:48,291 --> 01:52:52,166
Reet, you are a strong,
independent, beautiful woman.

1791
01:52:52,416 --> 01:52:55,125
You should be happy
that both your kids take after you.

1792
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
It's good that they bear no resemblance
to Varun in any way.

1793
01:52:58,416 --> 01:52:59,750
It means you have stronger genes.

1794
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Dominant genes.

1795
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:03,333
And how old are you? Just 39.

1796
01:53:03,666 --> 01:53:04,708
You can remarry.

1797
01:53:05,166 --> 01:53:06,791
I'll find you a good husband this time.

1798
01:53:07,416 --> 01:53:08,541
Join Swastik Oil,

1799
01:53:08,916 --> 01:53:10,250
get back to the family business.

1800
01:53:11,125 --> 01:53:13,333
Reet, you fell for the wrong guy.

1801
01:53:13,833 --> 01:53:16,125
Who considers all that
before falling in love?

1802
01:53:16,541 --> 01:53:17,916
You should fall in love only
after considering everything.

1803
01:53:18,125 --> 01:53:19,125
Look at Gitanjali.

1804
01:53:19,833 --> 01:53:22,375
Her father is a maths professor.
Simple clean background.

1805
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,625
Varun's father was a scamster too.

1806
01:53:26,375 --> 01:53:28,250
Don't pay attention to him, Reet.

1807
01:53:28,333 --> 01:53:30,750
Doctors said his body has pumped
a lot of chemicals,

1808
01:53:30,833 --> 01:53:32,666
so he is very disoriented right now.

1809
01:53:33,541 --> 01:53:35,208
You know what the saddest part is, Reet?

1810
01:53:35,916 --> 01:53:37,666
You shared your love with a criminal.

1811
01:53:38,125 --> 01:53:39,333
So what if Varun is dead?

1812
01:53:40,750 --> 01:53:41,958
If he's dead, he's dead.

1813
01:53:48,833 --> 01:53:49,875
Disorientated?

1814
01:53:53,291 --> 01:53:54,708
Swamiji, why are you
wearing pants and a shirt?

1815
01:53:55,875 --> 01:53:56,875
Where's your <i>vastra?</i>

1816
01:53:58,458 --> 01:53:59,833
I don't believe in wearing one.

1817
01:54:00,333 --> 01:54:01,416
Do you drink?

1818
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:03,666
No, son.

1819
01:54:04,166 --> 01:54:05,291
I abstain from worldly pleasures.

1820
01:54:06,958 --> 01:54:09,041
Abstain? So, you've never done it?

1821
01:54:10,208 --> 01:54:11,166
What are you saying?

1822
01:54:14,083 --> 01:54:16,666
Abstain means abstain.

1823
01:54:18,791 --> 01:54:22,291
After looking at your horoscope,
I would suggest...

1824
01:54:25,208 --> 01:54:26,625
you should embrace
the concept of mortality.

1825
01:54:29,416 --> 01:54:31,875
Your time on earth is coming to an end.

1826
01:54:33,541 --> 01:54:36,250
But have you ever considered
that a person's determination...

1827
01:54:37,666 --> 01:54:39,250
surpasses all these things?

1828
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:45,083
I say that to inspire others.

1829
01:54:45,708 --> 01:54:49,791
Swamiji, my determination transcends
the boundaries of my mortal existence.

1830
01:54:52,208 --> 01:54:53,625
If I continue to live...

1831
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,875
will you give up your vows of abstinence?

1832
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:00,458
Sangram!

1833
01:55:01,625 --> 01:55:02,916
Write down Swamiji's address...

1834
01:55:04,125 --> 01:55:05,750
and inform your well-wishers
to visit him.

1835
01:55:06,375 --> 01:55:08,166
He is going to need them.

1836
01:55:08,250 --> 01:55:09,750
<i>According to the scriptures,</i>

1837
01:55:09,833 --> 01:55:11,375
<i>his life is supposed
to be coming to an end.</i>

1838
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:14,833
Perform a Yagya ritual for his well-being.

1839
01:55:44,791 --> 01:55:45,791
Cow urine.

1840
01:55:53,666 --> 01:55:54,875
After all these years...

1841
01:55:56,166 --> 01:55:58,125
the entire family
has been brought together...

1842
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,208
by an unfortunate circumstance.

1843
01:56:13,666 --> 01:56:15,458
Jesus is our hope.

1844
01:56:15,541 --> 01:56:17,250
Jesus is our hope.

1845
01:56:17,333 --> 01:56:19,291
Jesus is our light.

1846
01:56:19,375 --> 01:56:21,166
Jesus is our light.

1847
01:56:21,250 --> 01:56:22,958
Jesus is our forgiveness.

1848
01:56:23,041 --> 01:56:24,916
Jesus is our forgiveness.

1849
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,958
And rise up and say with me...

1850
01:56:27,041 --> 01:56:27,958
- Amen!
- Where's Papa?

1851
01:56:28,041 --> 01:56:29,500
- Amen!
- He's on his way.

1852
01:56:29,583 --> 01:56:30,541
He'll reach soon.

1853
01:56:30,916 --> 01:56:32,208
Stop smoking.

1854
01:56:33,708 --> 01:56:36,583
If they find out, they'll take
your name off the heart donor list.

1855
01:56:37,041 --> 01:56:38,041
They'll take my name off the list?

1856
01:56:38,958 --> 01:56:40,458
For God's sake-- It's a church!

1857
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,958
Brother, now that you are here,

1858
01:56:44,375 --> 01:56:45,833
why don't you meet Father as well?

1859
01:56:46,333 --> 01:56:47,375
He is very powerful.

1860
01:56:47,666 --> 01:56:49,458
Confess to him,
and he'll wash away your sins.

1861
01:56:49,875 --> 01:56:50,916
What sin have I committed?

1862
01:56:51,333 --> 01:56:53,583
Just meet him once.
I'll go and ask him.

1863
01:56:54,875 --> 01:56:57,583
You have murdered
more than hundreds of people.

1864
01:56:57,666 --> 01:56:59,708
Gitanjali, if you say "murder" once again,

1865
01:56:59,791 --> 01:57:02,125
I will slap you so hard
like I slap other men around.

1866
01:57:02,541 --> 01:57:05,000
Not some weak, kiddie slap,
but a slap that'll make your ears ring.

1867
01:57:05,750 --> 01:57:07,583
They came to the hotel to kill me,

1868
01:57:07,916 --> 01:57:10,416
and not to watch the Pushpavati function
celebrating your puberty.

1869
01:57:11,750 --> 01:57:12,791
It's not murder...

1870
01:57:13,541 --> 01:57:14,416
it's progress.

1871
01:57:14,666 --> 01:57:15,625
You'll slap me?

1872
01:57:16,208 --> 01:57:17,583
You think I'll keep quiet?

1873
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,208
- I'll also slap you so hard--
- Yeah?

1874
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:22,375
You'll slap me
but I'll slap you first.

1875
01:57:26,750 --> 01:57:27,750
We had our first kiss.

1876
01:57:28,458 --> 01:57:29,375
We had our first sex.

1877
01:57:31,541 --> 01:57:33,291
We still haven't had our first slap.

1878
01:57:34,375 --> 01:57:35,708
No one has ever slapped you, right?

1879
01:57:36,250 --> 01:57:38,416
Looks like you are going
to get slapped pretty soon.

1880
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:40,416
Really?

1881
01:57:42,375 --> 01:57:43,291
What is this?

1882
01:57:43,708 --> 01:57:44,583
Listen to it.

1883
01:57:55,583 --> 01:57:56,458
<i>I love you.</i>

1884
01:57:57,208 --> 01:57:58,125
<i>I love you.</i>

1885
01:57:58,208 --> 01:57:59,458
They came to service the flight.

1886
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,541
Retrieved the sound from the black box.

1887
01:58:02,208 --> 01:58:03,416
Our first night together.

1888
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:05,500
<i>Do you want some water?</i>

1889
01:58:05,625 --> 01:58:07,125
No one else heard it, right?

1890
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:09,958
I'd told you,
if anyone heard or saw us,

1891
01:58:10,583 --> 01:58:11,625
I'd shoot them.

1892
01:58:12,208 --> 01:58:14,000
Brother, Father is ready.

1893
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:18,541
Brother, what went down?

1894
01:58:18,958 --> 01:58:20,083
I went to talk to him.

1895
01:58:20,833 --> 01:58:22,208
When I got there,
he made me kneel down.

1896
01:58:22,333 --> 01:58:23,208
Yeah, it's a procedure.

1897
01:58:23,291 --> 01:58:25,333
- I didn't know that was the procedure.
- Yeah.

1898
01:58:25,416 --> 01:58:26,916
It's like you're labeled a sinner
as soon as you step in.

1899
01:58:28,125 --> 01:58:31,375
Anyways, I started talking to him
and I told him everything honestly.

1900
01:58:32,875 --> 01:58:33,875
He began vomiting.

1901
01:58:38,166 --> 01:58:40,000
He thinks Swastik Steel's logo
is the same as Hitler's logo.

1902
01:58:40,708 --> 01:58:42,583
Swastik Steel's logo is straight.

1903
01:58:42,666 --> 01:58:43,625
Ours is straight.

1904
01:58:43,958 --> 01:58:45,000
The Nazi logo is slanted.

1905
01:58:47,208 --> 01:58:48,166
Where's Manjot?

1906
01:58:48,791 --> 01:58:50,416
He's offering water to Father.

1907
01:58:50,541 --> 01:58:52,458
Your brother is a sinner!

1908
01:58:53,166 --> 01:58:54,458
He is the Satan!

1909
01:58:55,625 --> 01:58:57,875
There is no redemption
for what he has done.

1910
01:58:58,208 --> 01:58:59,625
What are you saying, Father?

1911
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,708
I declare it today...

1912
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,041
he is a destructive force.

1913
01:59:06,166 --> 01:59:08,125
Stop irritating me, Gitanjali.
Open, open...

1914
01:59:08,208 --> 01:59:09,583
I'm not going to let you smoke today.

1915
01:59:10,041 --> 01:59:11,583
Do not crush...

1916
01:59:11,791 --> 01:59:13,833
my cigarettes!

1917
01:59:18,708 --> 01:59:21,625
Don't ever take
my cigarettes away from me.

1918
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:35,333
- Happy birthday, my child.
- Thanks, Nana.

1919
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:39,750
{\an8}What is going on?

1920
01:59:40,416 --> 01:59:41,625
What do you mean
what is going on?

1921
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,166
I mean, have you thought
about your future?

1922
01:59:44,583 --> 01:59:45,708
{\an8}What's there to think about, Amma?

1923
01:59:45,791 --> 01:59:47,416
{\an8}You have two kids, Gitanjali.

1924
01:59:47,875 --> 01:59:49,000
{\an8}Look at his state.

1925
01:59:49,291 --> 01:59:51,916
{\an8}Nana, keep the newspaper down.

1926
01:59:53,333 --> 01:59:56,333
For the last eight years,
you were making faces on the phone.

1927
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:58,791
So stuck up on our inter-cast marriage.

1928
01:59:59,250 --> 02:00:00,833
And suddenly you have this concern?
Why?

1929
02:00:01,250 --> 02:00:03,166
What do you mean by "this concern"?
We are concerned.

1930
02:00:03,250 --> 02:00:05,333
Then you should've shown up
when I was pregnant.

1931
02:00:05,416 --> 02:00:07,375
You didn't come,
my mother-in-law didn't come.

1932
02:00:07,458 --> 02:00:09,125
How do you think
I delivered two babies?

1933
02:00:09,458 --> 02:00:11,125
He helped me with the childbirths.

1934
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:14,041
When they induced labor,
I didn't feel any pain.

1935
02:00:14,291 --> 02:00:17,166
I had contractions
but the cervix was not opening.

1936
02:00:17,250 --> 02:00:19,250
I needed so much blood
because I lost so much blood.

1937
02:00:19,333 --> 02:00:22,791
It was such a mess. And he was
taking care of me all by himself

1938
02:00:23,458 --> 02:00:24,458
like a nurse.

1939
02:00:24,666 --> 02:00:26,416
And you know
what the most important thing is?

1940
02:00:26,750 --> 02:00:28,541
He never complained.

1941
02:00:35,458 --> 02:00:36,375
Hi, son.

1942
02:00:36,458 --> 02:00:37,958
You really don't know anything.

1943
02:00:38,750 --> 02:00:40,500
Amma, he is like my gynecologist.

1944
02:00:40,583 --> 02:00:42,166
He knows me in and out.

1945
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:46,458
He is my father, mother, brother,
boyfriend, husband, everything.

1946
02:00:48,166 --> 02:00:49,083
Brother...

1947
02:00:50,458 --> 02:00:51,416
we are leaving.

1948
02:00:51,833 --> 02:00:53,333
To party with the foreigners?

1949
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:56,875
Go on, do whatever you want.
I won't yell at anyone.

1950
02:00:57,125 --> 02:00:58,083
Go.

1951
02:00:59,750 --> 02:01:01,208
Uncle asked us to go back.

1952
02:01:03,291 --> 02:01:04,291
Papa!

1953
02:01:06,333 --> 02:01:07,333
Papa!

1954
02:01:10,083 --> 02:01:11,083
Papa!

1955
02:01:13,125 --> 02:01:15,333
Why did you ask them to leave?
Did you bring them here?

1956
02:01:15,666 --> 02:01:16,541
No, right?

1957
02:01:16,708 --> 02:01:17,583
I brought them here.

1958
02:01:18,250 --> 02:01:20,500
Papa, you were 66 when you got shot,

1959
02:01:20,583 --> 02:01:22,666
but I trusted you'll be alright
and you became alright.

1960
02:01:22,750 --> 02:01:24,916
I am 36. You don't trust me?!

1961
02:01:25,375 --> 02:01:27,416
You want to start mourning
before I'm even dead?

1962
02:01:27,791 --> 02:01:28,750
First thing,

1963
02:01:29,125 --> 02:01:32,083
don't speak to me
in this language... ever.

1964
02:01:32,375 --> 02:01:35,083
You don't value the doctors' reports
and advice at all?

1965
02:01:35,750 --> 02:01:38,500
Do you know
your heart can collapse any time now?

1966
02:01:39,083 --> 02:01:41,875
I would give you my heart if I could.

1967
02:01:42,375 --> 02:01:44,583
- But it doesn't work like that!
- Papa...

1968
02:01:45,791 --> 02:01:48,375
The trick is patience.

1969
02:01:49,208 --> 02:01:50,625
You know, when I was in ninth grade,

1970
02:01:51,458 --> 02:01:54,250
some twelfth graders beat me up in school.

1971
02:01:54,916 --> 02:01:55,875
You know why?

1972
02:01:56,916 --> 02:01:58,958
Your success made me a target.

1973
02:01:59,833 --> 02:02:01,375
I refrained from complaining to anyone.

1974
02:02:01,625 --> 02:02:04,083
Not to the principal,
not to Mom, not to you.

1975
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,666
I patiently waited.

1976
02:02:07,625 --> 02:02:11,000
As soon as I reached their level
in terms of height and weight,

1977
02:02:11,833 --> 02:02:14,708
I tracked each one of them down
and thrashed them at their own college.

1978
02:02:16,458 --> 02:02:18,916
There's something so satisfying
about hitting back after waiting.

1979
02:02:20,291 --> 02:02:22,708
Now, I'm waiting once again.
You should wait too.

1980
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:24,500
Someone will surely die for me,

1981
02:02:24,916 --> 02:02:26,375
and I'll get a new heart
for the transplant.

1982
02:02:27,250 --> 02:02:29,791
Papa, we still have so much left to do.
Don't we?

1983
02:02:29,875 --> 02:02:33,166
We have to find him,
catch him, kill him.

1984
02:02:33,958 --> 02:02:35,041
There's so much left.

1985
02:02:35,666 --> 02:02:36,750
You relax, Papa.

1986
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,541
Papa thinks this battle
will be a cakewalk.

1987
02:02:45,833 --> 02:02:46,875
No one's going anywhere.

1988
02:03:02,375 --> 02:03:03,416
Gitanjali!

1989
02:03:03,833 --> 02:03:04,791
Gitanjali!

1990
02:03:05,416 --> 02:03:07,541
How many times have I told you
not to use sign language?!

1991
02:03:07,666 --> 02:03:08,750
You didn't tell her?

1992
02:03:08,916 --> 02:03:10,541
Use your words.
I'm not deaf!

1993
02:03:12,250 --> 02:03:13,666
Sheela, come with me.

1994
02:03:28,375 --> 02:03:29,333
Eat.

1995
02:03:37,666 --> 02:03:38,708
Let me warm it up for you.

1996
02:03:39,125 --> 02:03:40,000
Why?

1997
02:03:41,041 --> 02:03:42,791
You thought I wouldn't find out
just because I can't taste?

1998
02:03:44,125 --> 02:03:45,333
You added extra salt to it, right?

1999
02:03:46,583 --> 02:03:47,875
I could sense it from how thick it was.

2000
02:03:48,083 --> 02:03:49,000
Please give...

2001
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:50,916
Next time you're annoyed with me,

2002
02:03:51,791 --> 02:03:53,291
don't mess with the salt or pepper.

2003
02:03:55,125 --> 02:03:56,625
Just add some poison instead.

2004
02:03:58,875 --> 02:03:59,875
Story over.

2005
02:04:21,250 --> 02:04:22,791
What was your mom saying in Telugu?

2006
02:04:24,416 --> 02:04:25,291
Nothing.

2007
02:04:25,750 --> 02:04:28,666
No. She was definitely
saying something.

2008
02:04:28,958 --> 02:04:31,208
And when I came, you changed the topic.

2009
02:04:31,791 --> 02:04:33,333
We didn't speak a word in Telugu.

2010
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,666
We were just talking about Kartik.

2011
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,125
I see.

2012
02:04:37,208 --> 02:04:39,541
So, you guys were going on
and on about Kartik?

2013
02:04:40,166 --> 02:04:41,250
It's hurting!

2014
02:04:42,250 --> 02:04:45,958
Tell me, your mom is looking
for a Telugu boy for you, right?

2015
02:04:48,375 --> 02:04:49,750
What nonsense are you saying?

2016
02:04:49,833 --> 02:04:51,916
- Don't. Please.
- You are excited

2017
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,791
- to get married to a Telugu boy?
- Please. It's hurting.

2018
02:04:53,875 --> 02:04:54,958
It's hurting. Please.

2019
02:04:55,041 --> 02:04:56,041
- What will you do about it?
- Don't...

2020
02:04:56,125 --> 02:04:57,125
Don't!

2021
02:05:07,208 --> 02:05:10,833
Back in school, Roop told us...

2022
02:05:12,125 --> 02:05:15,666
how someone
messed with Reet in college...

2023
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:19,375
and you took a gun there.

2024
02:05:19,541 --> 02:05:23,041
When I heard that,
I thought your firing should never stop.

2025
02:05:24,375 --> 02:05:26,333
I was excited...

2026
02:05:26,791 --> 02:05:30,541
thinking about what you'd do
if someone ever messed with me.

2027
02:05:33,416 --> 02:05:35,666
But now, I'm scared when I see you.

2028
02:05:35,791 --> 02:05:38,500
I wonder what else you will do
and when you will stop.

2029
02:05:39,458 --> 02:05:46,250
<i>Take me to a place like Kashmir
And we'll conquer it all</i>

2030
02:05:46,666 --> 02:05:50,166
<i>I'll show you how to love</i>

2031
02:05:50,458 --> 02:05:53,375
<i>Where the snow-covered mountains
Stand tall</i>

2032
02:05:53,583 --> 02:06:00,416
<i>We'll soar above the lakes together</i>

2033
02:06:00,750 --> 02:06:07,416
<i>I'll show you how to love
And conquer it all</i>

2034
02:06:07,708 --> 02:06:09,250
Gitanjali, I can't taste you.

2035
02:06:11,666 --> 02:06:12,666
I can't smell you.

2036
02:06:17,125 --> 02:06:18,125
I'm sorry.

2037
02:06:18,375 --> 02:06:21,208
<i>In a realm where nights are icy cold</i>

2038
02:06:21,416 --> 02:06:24,333
<i>Where trees speak
In fragrant whispers untold</i>

2039
02:06:24,416 --> 02:06:30,625
<i>And fireflies dance
With conversations ablaze</i>

2040
02:06:30,708 --> 02:06:36,958
<i>It's where heaven resides</i>

2041
02:06:37,458 --> 02:06:44,416
<i>Where angels forever stay</i>

2042
02:06:44,625 --> 02:06:50,750
<i>Where the clouds dwell too</i>

2043
02:06:50,916 --> 02:06:56,208
<i>So vibrant and blue</i>

2044
02:06:56,375 --> 02:07:01,500
<i>Paint me in their hues too</i>

2045
02:07:01,583 --> 02:07:02,750
Did you catch what he said?

2046
02:07:03,625 --> 02:07:04,833
"I'll find him and kill him."

2047
02:07:05,083 --> 02:07:08,125
You don't think you still have some
external threat hanging over you?

2048
02:07:08,375 --> 02:07:10,000
He is consuming steroids
like they are chocolates!

2049
02:07:10,750 --> 02:07:12,750
But after a point,
even steroids won't work!

2050
02:07:13,541 --> 02:07:15,291
And he is gaining weight like a pig!

2051
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,583
He's not a kid.
He's a father of two kids.

2052
02:07:20,083 --> 02:07:23,916
You've always tried
to change him and fix him

2053
02:07:24,291 --> 02:07:26,666
as if he were a machine
in a steel factory!

2054
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,750
Children need love, Balbir.

2055
02:07:30,250 --> 02:07:32,708
- Love and attention.
- Don't bring up that topic again!

2056
02:07:33,500 --> 02:07:34,375
Don't start it again!

2057
02:07:34,458 --> 02:07:35,333
- He still wants the same thing...
- Quiet!

2058
02:07:35,416 --> 02:07:36,708
- that he wanted back then!
- Quiet!

2059
02:07:42,333 --> 02:07:43,250
What do you expect me to say?

2060
02:07:45,166 --> 02:07:46,250
That I made a mistake?

2061
02:07:47,333 --> 02:07:48,750
I don't believe in regrets!

2062
02:07:49,541 --> 02:07:50,750
Neither does your son.

2063
02:07:51,541 --> 02:07:56,875
<i>I'll hold you close, my love, so tight</i>

2064
02:07:56,958 --> 02:08:02,750
<i>Shielding myself
From winter's chilling bite</i>

2065
02:08:03,125 --> 02:08:08,375
<i>I'll wrap my arms around you altogether</i>

2066
02:08:08,458 --> 02:08:13,708
<i>And be lost in your embrace forever</i>

2067
02:08:13,791 --> 02:08:19,541
<i>What are you waiting for then?</i>

2068
02:08:19,625 --> 02:08:24,916
<i>Tell me again, how do I stop myself?</i>

2069
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:31,208
<i>Like a fresh waterfall</i>

2070
02:08:31,291 --> 02:08:37,500
<i>Love we'll consume</i>

2071
02:08:37,625 --> 02:08:43,416
<i>Lakes, rivers, and snow-covered mountains</i>

2072
02:08:43,500 --> 02:08:49,291
<i>- I'll gift them all to you, my love</i>
- Look at yourself. Mother of two kids.

2073
02:08:56,208 --> 02:08:59,000
- We got a call from the hospital.
<i>- ...consignment with a scope.</i>

2074
02:08:59,083 --> 02:09:00,375
They might have got a donor.

2075
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:01,833
No, I don't like this design.

2076
02:09:02,416 --> 02:09:03,625
<i>I understand, Vijay.</i>

2077
02:09:03,791 --> 02:09:05,916
- We have a meeting in the evening.
- Mark, Mark, Mark...

2078
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,500
I'll personally draw my own designs.

2079
02:09:07,583 --> 02:09:10,416
- It's my touch.
<i>- Okay. I'm afraid it's...</i>

2080
02:09:10,500 --> 02:09:12,833
- Are you ordering for more guns?
<i>- Especially your drawings, Vijay.</i>

2081
02:09:12,958 --> 02:09:14,583
I have this local guy Freddy.

2082
02:09:14,875 --> 02:09:16,541
You can get in touch with him.
He will co-ordinate everything.

2083
02:09:16,625 --> 02:09:19,375
<i>I know this guy.
I don't want to meet this guy again.</i>

2084
02:09:29,875 --> 02:09:32,583
In a marriage,
there should be some fear,

2085
02:09:33,166 --> 02:09:34,208
and some control.

2086
02:09:35,708 --> 02:09:39,041
But I've lost all control
as it's a love marriage.

2087
02:09:40,416 --> 02:09:41,791
But you all need to be careful.

2088
02:09:43,291 --> 02:09:44,333
Hold on tight to that control.

2089
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,666
If you lose respect,
you lose everything.

2090
02:09:51,250 --> 02:09:52,416
Despite her small stature...

2091
02:09:53,375 --> 02:09:55,000
she spoke some real big words.

2092
02:10:01,791 --> 02:10:02,791
One more thing.

2093
02:10:03,916 --> 02:10:06,625
A married man should never
have a protruding belly.

2094
02:10:08,291 --> 02:10:09,333
It causes problems.

2095
02:10:10,291 --> 02:10:11,458
Gitanjali!

2096
02:10:11,916 --> 02:10:13,333
I took six bullet shots.

2097
02:10:13,750 --> 02:10:15,500
I got multiple fractures all over.

2098
02:10:15,916 --> 02:10:18,250
There are so many pipes inserted
from the penis to the anus,

2099
02:10:18,333 --> 02:10:19,916
and you think I'm just imagining it all?

2100
02:10:20,041 --> 02:10:23,250
Not just me! Your mom, dad, sisters,
cousins, everyone thinks the same!

2101
02:10:23,333 --> 02:10:25,458
Think like a man, Gitanjali!

2102
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:27,750
Think like you have biceps like me!

2103
02:10:28,458 --> 02:10:30,916
Think like you don't have this,
but a chest like mine.

2104
02:10:31,541 --> 02:10:33,625
Even down there,
you have something like what I have got.

2105
02:10:33,958 --> 02:10:34,833
Now tell me,

2106
02:10:34,916 --> 02:10:38,083
if someone keeps trying to kill
your father, what will you do?

2107
02:10:39,250 --> 02:10:40,166
Will you just sit on your hands...

2108
02:10:41,125 --> 02:10:42,416
or fight back?

2109
02:10:44,125 --> 02:10:45,125
You will fight back, right?

2110
02:10:46,291 --> 02:10:47,208
Why aren't you saying anything?

2111
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:48,416
Look at yourself.

2112
02:10:48,875 --> 02:10:50,375
You're thinking that you'd fight back.

2113
02:10:50,708 --> 02:10:52,166
I fought a war!

2114
02:10:53,333 --> 02:10:56,208
Like men have been fighting
for thousands of years!

2115
02:10:58,208 --> 02:10:59,458
What are you doing, Gitanjali?

2116
02:10:59,625 --> 02:11:01,083
Sadly, it's a man's world.

2117
02:11:01,750 --> 02:11:02,666
Brother...

2118
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:04,708
- What?
- Brother...

2119
02:11:04,916 --> 02:11:07,791
Oh, you have come to save the doll
from the monster.

2120
02:11:07,875 --> 02:11:11,250
Her parents never interfere,
so who do think you are?! Out!

2121
02:11:11,333 --> 02:11:13,875
You are fighting ghosts in your head.
Do you even realize that?

2122
02:11:13,958 --> 02:11:16,041
I don't fight ghosts, I devour them!

2123
02:11:17,583 --> 02:11:18,666
There's somebody out there, Gitanjali,

2124
02:11:19,166 --> 02:11:21,958
who's waiting for another chance.
Trust me.

2125
02:11:22,958 --> 02:11:24,000
There is somebody out there.

2126
02:11:24,625 --> 02:11:28,000
You have gone mad.

2127
02:11:28,083 --> 02:11:29,541
You have lost your mind.

2128
02:11:37,166 --> 02:11:41,041
You change pads four times a month!

2129
02:11:41,875 --> 02:11:45,000
I change mine 50 freaking times a day!

2130
02:11:45,375 --> 02:11:47,833
Mom, Papa!
Why are you guys fighting?

2131
02:11:48,083 --> 02:11:49,333
Hi, Abhay!

2132
02:11:52,458 --> 02:11:54,000
We were not fighting.

2133
02:11:54,625 --> 02:11:57,416
You see, your mom
used to work in America.

2134
02:11:57,791 --> 02:11:59,750
And now that we're back in India,
she's bored.

2135
02:12:00,208 --> 02:12:01,125
She's jobless.

2136
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,750
Now she wants to act.

2137
02:12:04,083 --> 02:12:05,416
She wants to become a heroine.

2138
02:12:06,166 --> 02:12:08,000
Look at her. Isn't she pretty?

2139
02:12:08,541 --> 02:12:10,708
- Yup.
- We weren't fighting, Abhay.

2140
02:12:10,791 --> 02:12:12,166
We were only rehearsing our lines.

2141
02:12:12,458 --> 02:12:14,291
And Papa is a director.

2142
02:12:15,041 --> 02:12:16,500
You are the hero, Papa.

2143
02:12:17,416 --> 02:12:19,166
Abhay, go inside.

2144
02:12:26,916 --> 02:12:28,000
Hey, Gitanjali.

2145
02:12:28,875 --> 02:12:31,458
Say this once.
"You're going to be fine. You're a hero."

2146
02:12:32,541 --> 02:12:33,708
You're going to be fine.

2147
02:12:34,041 --> 02:12:34,916
You're a hero.

2148
02:12:35,250 --> 02:12:37,083
Say it right, with some conviction.

2149
02:12:37,541 --> 02:12:38,666
I already said it.

2150
02:12:39,125 --> 02:12:40,125
What else do you want me to say?

2151
02:12:40,250 --> 02:12:42,000
Hey, Gitanjali,
did I hurt you when I did this?

2152
02:12:42,083 --> 02:12:43,250
Yeah? Did you get...

2153
02:12:44,125 --> 02:12:45,166
You didn't hurt me at all.

2154
02:12:46,208 --> 02:12:48,958
Then say this, "You're a hero.
You're going to be fine."

2155
02:12:49,416 --> 02:12:50,625
You are a superhero.

2156
02:12:51,291 --> 02:12:52,416
You are going to be fine.

2157
02:12:53,250 --> 02:12:54,166
Happy now?

2158
02:12:54,416 --> 02:12:56,416
Get ready for the doctor's appointment
in the evening.

2159
02:13:15,708 --> 02:13:19,208
<i>Oh, my cutie, don't play with my heart</i>

2160
02:13:19,750 --> 02:13:23,125
<i>You are leaving and embarking on a journey
And I'm getting crazy</i>

2161
02:13:23,666 --> 02:13:27,083
<i>Oh, my cutie, don't play with my heart</i>

2162
02:13:27,666 --> 02:13:31,125
<i>You are leaving and embarking on a journey
And I'm getting crazy</i>

2163
02:13:31,625 --> 02:13:34,708
<i>Oh, my love, my beloved...</i>

2164
02:13:35,500 --> 02:13:38,666
<i>Oh, my love, my beloved...</i>

2165
02:13:42,791 --> 02:13:46,583
Sister-in-law, you are joining us as
the third wife of my brother Abrar Haque.

2166
02:13:46,666 --> 02:13:47,958
There are some things
you already know,

2167
02:13:48,041 --> 02:13:51,000
like he has been married twice before
and has eight children.

2168
02:13:51,291 --> 02:13:53,208
There are some things
you need to know.

2169
02:13:53,833 --> 02:13:57,333
He can't talk,
but he isn't mute since birth.

2170
02:13:57,875 --> 02:13:59,041
One night...

2171
02:13:59,916 --> 02:14:03,458
he saw our grandfather
go up in flames right before his eyes.

2172
02:14:04,875 --> 02:14:07,750
And from that day on,
he can't speak.

2173
02:14:09,250 --> 02:14:12,250
He had immeasurable love
for our grandfather, and still does.

2174
02:14:14,625 --> 02:14:18,166
Since then, I am his translator.

2175
02:14:19,041 --> 02:14:21,541
So, I am going to be
the bridge between you...

2176
02:14:22,458 --> 02:14:24,041
and my brother Abrar.

2177
02:14:29,333 --> 02:14:30,250
Come.

2178
02:14:30,791 --> 02:14:34,333
<i>Oh, my cutie, don't play with my heart</i>

2179
02:14:34,791 --> 02:14:38,333
<i>You are leaving, embarking on a journey
And I'm getting crazy</i>

2180
02:14:38,875 --> 02:14:42,333
<i>Oh, my cutie, don't play with my heart</i>

2181
02:14:42,875 --> 02:14:46,375
<i>You are leaving, embarking on a journey
And I'm getting crazy</i>

2182
02:14:46,916 --> 02:14:50,000
<i>Oh, my love, my beloved...</i>

2183
02:14:50,916 --> 02:14:54,125
<i>- Oh, my love, my beloved...</i>
- He wants to see you.

2184
02:14:54,958 --> 02:14:58,083
<i>- Oh, my love, my beloved...</i>
- Come on.

2185
02:14:58,791 --> 02:15:01,875
<i>Oh, my love, my beloved...</i>

2186
02:15:02,625 --> 02:15:05,625
<i>Oh, my love, my beloved...</i>

2187
02:15:06,250 --> 02:15:10,166
<i>You are leaving, embarking on a journey</i>

2188
02:15:10,291 --> 02:15:14,250
<i>And I'm getting crazy</i>

2189
02:15:14,333 --> 02:15:19,041
<i>Don't play with my heart
And don't trouble me by ignoring me</i>

2190
02:15:19,250 --> 02:15:24,000
<i>Don't make me to follow you all the time
And be nice to me</i>

2191
02:15:24,291 --> 02:15:29,083
<i>Don't play with my heart
And don't trouble me by ignoring me</i>

2192
02:15:29,333 --> 02:15:34,416
<i>Don't make me to follow you all the time
And be nice to me</i>

2193
02:15:34,541 --> 02:15:38,041
<i>Oh, my love, my beloved...</i>

2194
02:15:38,458 --> 02:15:41,625
<i>Oh, my love, my beloved...</i>

2195
02:15:51,458 --> 02:15:54,458
<i>Oh, my cutie, don't play with my heart</i>

2196
02:15:54,583 --> 02:15:56,583
In the name of Allah,
the most gracious, the most merciful...

2197
02:15:56,708 --> 02:16:01,250
Abrar, in the presence of two witnesses,

2198
02:16:01,375 --> 02:16:04,625
do you willingly accept Fareen
as your wife?

2199
02:16:08,583 --> 02:16:09,458
Do you know why he's getting married?

2200
02:16:11,250 --> 02:16:12,250
Because he knocked her up.

2201
02:16:13,041 --> 02:16:14,041
She's pregnant.

2202
02:16:14,166 --> 02:16:15,458
She got to know yesterday

2203
02:16:16,041 --> 02:16:17,333
and they're getting married today.

2204
02:16:18,083 --> 02:16:19,333
It's a good thing.

2205
02:16:19,958 --> 02:16:21,416
He'll stay away from us for some time.

2206
02:16:23,083 --> 02:16:24,375
There's no guarantee of that.

2207
02:16:24,958 --> 02:16:26,041
Tell me frankly...

2208
02:16:27,041 --> 02:16:28,541
why did you marry this guy?

2209
02:16:29,208 --> 02:16:31,458
I married him because he can't talk.

2210
02:16:31,791 --> 02:16:33,416
I prefer peace in a relationship.

2211
02:16:33,541 --> 02:16:34,500
What about you?

2212
02:16:36,625 --> 02:16:37,708
He is loaded.

2213
02:16:43,750 --> 02:16:45,541
Congratulations on your wedding.

2214
02:16:50,291 --> 02:16:51,833
Where have you been?

2215
02:17:03,666 --> 02:17:05,875
Brother, Asrar was killed in Delhi.

2216
02:17:13,375 --> 02:17:15,750
Abid had told me not to tell you.

2217
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:03,583
Women, please leave.

2218
02:18:04,041 --> 02:18:05,083
All men...

2219
02:18:06,041 --> 02:18:08,458
please maintain silence for two minutes

2220
02:18:08,541 --> 02:18:11,833
in the honor of my dead brother, Asrar.

2221
02:19:17,333 --> 02:19:18,208
What is going on?

2222
02:19:22,500 --> 02:19:23,375
She is new here.

2223
02:19:23,625 --> 02:19:25,791
Give her some time,
she'll understand your style.

2224
02:19:29,416 --> 02:19:32,458
It took two nights
to search for the body in Delhi...

2225
02:19:34,291 --> 02:19:37,250
and three months
to bring it here after freezing it.

2226
02:19:37,958 --> 02:19:40,208
It takes time to thaw the body.

2227
02:19:43,166 --> 02:19:45,791
I was waiting for the right time
to inform you.

2228
02:19:46,250 --> 02:19:48,875
But that foolish person arrived
and disrupted the wedding atmosphere.

2229
02:19:50,625 --> 02:19:51,541
Where are we going now?

2230
02:20:18,208 --> 02:20:20,666
Brother, you know what Asrar was like.

2231
02:20:21,500 --> 02:20:24,083
He asked me to shut up.
What... what can I do?

2232
02:20:33,250 --> 02:20:36,833
Killing Balbir
was part of a fantastic plan.

2233
02:20:37,125 --> 02:20:41,083
This would have destroyed
the man who built Swastik,

2234
02:20:41,458 --> 02:20:43,208
the company from where

2235
02:20:43,291 --> 02:20:47,583
our grandfather was thrown out like a dog.

2236
02:20:47,875 --> 02:20:52,875
You guys turned a small thing
into a significant ego matter

2237
02:20:53,666 --> 02:20:55,083
and went after his son.

2238
02:20:55,166 --> 02:20:56,041
Why?

2239
02:20:56,125 --> 02:20:57,708
And because of that screw-up...

2240
02:20:58,958 --> 02:21:00,458
my brother is dead.

2241
02:21:02,958 --> 02:21:08,208
Now you go
and apologize to my brother.

2242
02:23:03,916 --> 02:23:04,833
I understand, son.

2243
02:23:05,083 --> 02:23:06,250
You deserve to celebrate,

2244
02:23:06,833 --> 02:23:08,000
but this is not the way.

2245
02:23:08,333 --> 02:23:09,250
Just get inside.

2246
02:23:12,250 --> 02:23:13,291
Brother, this is Zoya.

2247
02:23:13,916 --> 02:23:16,208
She has been trying to meet you
for the past three months.

2248
02:23:17,541 --> 02:23:19,458
That heart you got
belongs to her fiancé.

2249
02:23:20,041 --> 02:23:22,875
I tried to stop her,
but she still made it here.

2250
02:23:33,458 --> 02:23:35,000
Thank you for meeting me.

2251
02:23:36,250 --> 02:23:40,625
I just wanted to hear
this heart beat again.

2252
02:23:42,458 --> 02:23:43,458
Please.

2253
02:23:52,666 --> 02:23:53,666
Thank you...

2254
02:23:54,250 --> 02:23:55,250
for letting me in.

2255
02:24:10,833 --> 02:24:11,708
Stop the car.

2256
02:24:13,166 --> 02:24:14,708
Listen, don't leave just yet.

2257
02:24:15,208 --> 02:24:19,541
Stay here till you feel better, okay?

2258
02:24:21,083 --> 02:24:21,958
Come.

2259
02:24:25,333 --> 02:24:26,250
Manjot!

2260
02:24:26,500 --> 02:24:28,291
Take her to Grandpa's house in Janpath.

2261
02:24:29,291 --> 02:24:31,958
It's my grandfather's place.
It's a secure and comfortable house.

2262
02:24:33,750 --> 02:24:35,333
You can leave. Wait!

2263
02:24:35,583 --> 02:24:36,625
Manjot, get her bags out.

2264
02:24:38,416 --> 02:24:39,541
I'll swing by to see you.

2265
02:24:40,750 --> 02:24:41,791
Take care of yourself.

2266
02:24:49,375 --> 02:24:50,375
Who's going on, brother?

2267
02:24:50,875 --> 02:24:52,833
I have never seen this color.

2268
02:25:03,541 --> 02:25:04,500
Mohsin, where's that girl?

2269
02:25:04,583 --> 02:25:06,500
- First floor.
- That was Grandpa's office.

2270
02:25:06,583 --> 02:25:07,458
This is his house.

2271
02:25:08,125 --> 02:25:10,875
- Son... who is that girl?
- Grandpa, I'll be back in two minutes.

2272
02:25:10,958 --> 02:25:12,166
Give me your blessings.
Two minutes.

2273
02:25:15,666 --> 02:25:17,125
- I seek your blessings, Granduncle.
- I seek your blessings.

2274
02:25:17,541 --> 02:25:18,541
{\an8}God bless you.

2275
02:25:19,125 --> 02:25:20,791
{\an8}Who is that girl?

2276
02:25:22,583 --> 02:25:24,750
Manjot, what's her name?

2277
02:25:26,083 --> 02:25:26,958
Zoya.

2278
02:25:53,500 --> 02:25:58,541
<i>I've met you before</i>

2279
02:25:59,791 --> 02:26:01,708
<i>When our eyes first intertwined</i>

2280
02:26:02,791 --> 02:26:04,708
<i>That's how I felt, you know</i>

2281
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:10,958
<i>You touched my wounds</i>

2282
02:26:12,041 --> 02:26:17,125
<i>And my heart... it healed</i>

2283
02:26:19,208 --> 02:26:22,333
<i>We're both a little crazy</i>

2284
02:26:22,416 --> 02:26:25,416
<i>Floating like clouds up above</i>

2285
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:27,416
<i>Come, let's rain down</i>

2286
02:26:27,500 --> 02:26:30,833
<i>Come, let's soak in love</i>

2287
02:26:30,916 --> 02:26:35,916
<i>I've met you before</i>

2288
02:26:37,166 --> 02:26:39,166
<i>When our eyes first intertwined</i>

2289
02:26:40,208 --> 02:26:42,166
<i>- That's how I felt, you know</i>
- What?

2290
02:26:42,250 --> 02:26:44,166
Granduncle wants to know
how much longer it's going to take.

2291
02:26:44,500 --> 02:26:47,458
Ask him how long he used to take!

2292
02:26:49,708 --> 02:26:50,916
Go and ask him.

2293
02:26:51,875 --> 02:26:55,916
I crave motivation, inspiration,
and that uplifting surge of dopamine.

2294
02:26:56,875 --> 02:26:59,708
- How do I keep motivating myself?
- You want motivation, right?

2295
02:27:00,125 --> 02:27:01,208
Then try exercising.

2296
02:27:01,541 --> 02:27:02,583
Try meditating.

2297
02:27:02,708 --> 02:27:04,708
Grandpa, I'm very strong.
You don't know anything.

2298
02:27:05,458 --> 02:27:07,541
What have you seen in life,
going from old transistors to radios

2299
02:27:07,625 --> 02:27:09,666
to black and white TVs,
and then to color TVs.

2300
02:27:10,083 --> 02:27:12,250
You've only experienced
a few transitions and colors in life.

2301
02:27:12,791 --> 02:27:15,458
You can't even imagine how many things
I'm witnessing these days, Grandpa.

2302
02:27:15,708 --> 02:27:17,041
- Really?
- You have no idea what's happening

2303
02:27:17,125 --> 02:27:19,000
- in the world nowadays.
- I see.

2304
02:27:19,583 --> 02:27:21,416
You should be happy
I'm not doing drugs at least.

2305
02:27:21,500 --> 02:27:24,291
- Otherwise, I'd keep sitting--
- Cut this nonsense out.

2306
02:27:24,625 --> 02:27:26,583
Tell me, what are you
doing with that girl?

2307
02:27:27,541 --> 02:27:28,916
Come on, Grandpa,
I can't tell you that.

2308
02:27:29,125 --> 02:27:30,250
You shameless punk!

2309
02:27:31,791 --> 02:27:34,416
I never thought
you'd become this shameless.

2310
02:27:34,708 --> 02:27:36,458
Grandpa, back in your day, did you ever...

2311
02:27:36,541 --> 02:27:37,666
outside of marriage...

2312
02:27:38,916 --> 02:27:40,791
- Never?
- Never!

2313
02:27:54,708 --> 02:27:57,625
<i>What's right? What's wrong?</i>

2314
02:27:57,875 --> 02:28:00,708
<i>I don't know</i>

2315
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,833
<i>- If you have the answers...</i>
- Your wife?

2316
02:28:04,125 --> 02:28:06,708
<i>- Please tell me</i>
- Yeah.

2317
02:28:06,791 --> 02:28:09,500
- Kids?
- Yeah.

2318
02:28:10,416 --> 02:28:13,541
<i>- I've been lost for too long</i>
- She is calling.

2319
02:28:13,625 --> 02:28:19,208
<i>If you have found me
Tell me where I belong</i>

2320
02:28:27,083 --> 02:28:33,083
<i>Your scent, it's like a dream</i>

2321
02:28:33,208 --> 02:28:39,458
<i>I want to lose myself in it and be free</i>

2322
02:28:39,541 --> 02:28:45,666
<i>I want to hide the mornings in my embrace</i>

2323
02:28:45,791 --> 02:28:51,375
<i>And be together forever this way</i>

2324
02:28:51,625 --> 02:28:57,666
<i>I want to spend my days
Being simply mesmerized by you</i>

2325
02:28:57,750 --> 02:29:03,291
<i>I've met you before</i>

2326
02:29:03,875 --> 02:29:06,541
<i>When our eyes first intertwined</i>

2327
02:29:06,875 --> 02:29:10,041
<i>That's how I felt, you know</i>

2328
02:29:10,125 --> 02:29:15,750
<i>You touched my wounds</i>

2329
02:29:16,166 --> 02:29:22,625
<i>And my heart... it healed</i>

2330
02:29:23,333 --> 02:29:26,500
<i>We're both a little crazy</i>

2331
02:29:26,583 --> 02:29:29,541
<i>Floating like clouds up above</i>

2332
02:29:29,625 --> 02:29:35,041
<i>Come, let's rain down
Come, let's soak in love</i>

2333
02:29:35,125 --> 02:29:40,041
<i>I've met you before</i>

2334
02:29:41,291 --> 02:29:43,166
He bloody gave me a lecture
that day for doing this stuff.

2335
02:29:43,666 --> 02:29:45,833
This is a 200-year-old British Club,

2336
02:29:46,708 --> 02:29:49,625
and he has booked it to do the same stuff?

2337
02:29:49,916 --> 02:29:51,083
It's love, brother.

2338
02:29:51,458 --> 02:29:53,833
And rich people tend to fall
in love a couple of times at least.

2339
02:29:54,041 --> 02:29:55,791
This isn't love, man.

2340
02:29:56,125 --> 02:29:58,708
The only difference is that we have
to pay for it,

2341
02:29:59,291 --> 02:30:00,500
and he uses his expertise.

2342
02:30:00,583 --> 02:30:02,375
He's got her fiancé's heart inside him.

2343
02:30:02,750 --> 02:30:04,000
He probably got touched
by it or something.

2344
02:30:04,083 --> 02:30:05,791
There is no such thing!

2345
02:30:05,875 --> 02:30:08,208
Brother, I think he's in love too.

2346
02:30:08,291 --> 02:30:09,166
Love?

2347
02:30:09,375 --> 02:30:10,250
In just one week?

2348
02:30:10,500 --> 02:30:11,875
Did he ever offer you a cup of tea?

2349
02:30:12,791 --> 02:30:15,583
Look over there,
he's offering her a mixed fruit juice.

2350
02:30:15,666 --> 02:30:16,708
The one he made himself.

2351
02:30:17,041 --> 02:30:18,875
He's in love with her, dummy.

2352
02:30:18,958 --> 02:30:21,000
Who will get the mixed fruit juice?
Her or you?

2353
02:30:21,083 --> 02:30:23,833
We were also offering them
breakfast that day.

2354
02:30:25,291 --> 02:30:26,875
Sangram, just let it go.

2355
02:30:26,958 --> 02:30:30,208
Seriously, headman! Stop it.

2356
02:30:30,541 --> 02:30:32,500
He'll go ballistic if he hears us.

2357
02:30:35,625 --> 02:30:36,708
He's headed this way.

2358
02:30:40,291 --> 02:30:41,208
What are you staring at?

2359
02:30:44,750 --> 02:30:48,041
Treat her the way
you treat Gitanjali at home.

2360
02:30:48,500 --> 02:30:49,458
Yes, brother.

2361
02:30:49,916 --> 02:30:50,791
Okay?

2362
02:30:51,333 --> 02:30:53,333
- That's exactly what I was telling him.
- Brother...

2363
02:30:53,416 --> 02:30:54,291
Shut up.

2364
02:30:54,875 --> 02:30:55,750
Sunny...

2365
02:31:00,666 --> 02:31:01,625
Enjoy the love.

2366
02:31:03,875 --> 02:31:06,208
Did he really hear us?

2367
02:31:06,375 --> 02:31:08,625
- I don't know.
- He didn't have his hearing aid on.

2368
02:31:10,125 --> 02:31:11,958
Paali! Royal!

2369
02:31:12,583 --> 02:31:13,458
Yes, sister-in-law?

2370
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:15,208
What's happening with your brother?

2371
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,208
He's not showing up for lunch.
He doesn't even make it for dinner.

2372
02:31:18,541 --> 02:31:19,458
Call him up.

2373
02:31:19,541 --> 02:31:21,208
Actually, he's pretty busy these days.

2374
02:31:21,708 --> 02:31:23,000
He's busy 24-7?

2375
02:31:23,791 --> 02:31:24,750
Call him right now.

2376
02:31:32,166 --> 02:31:33,166
He's not picking up.

2377
02:31:37,250 --> 02:31:38,625
You didn't even dial once.

2378
02:31:38,958 --> 02:31:40,000
Why did you act like you did?

2379
02:31:41,333 --> 02:31:42,416
Who's this "Sister-in-law 2"?

2380
02:31:42,833 --> 02:31:44,833
She's the wife of my cousin in Jalandhar.

2381
02:31:46,166 --> 02:31:49,125
She's a working woman. She's probably
asleep. Let's not disturb her.

2382
02:31:49,583 --> 02:31:51,000
It's pretty late.
She's probably asleep.

2383
02:31:55,541 --> 02:31:56,625
She's not answering either.

2384
02:31:56,708 --> 02:31:58,125
Like I said, she's probably asleep.

2385
02:32:00,500 --> 02:32:01,583
Come, guys.

2386
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,875
I want to order a Rolls Royce,
but I have a special request.

2387
02:32:08,083 --> 02:32:09,083
I want this color.

2388
02:32:09,625 --> 02:32:10,916
Can you see it?
Right here.

2389
02:32:11,791 --> 02:32:13,041
Can you see it?

2390
02:32:14,083 --> 02:32:15,750
It's okay. They are professionals.

2391
02:32:16,458 --> 02:32:17,833
I want exactly this color.

2392
02:32:18,666 --> 02:32:19,625
Is it possible?

2393
02:32:20,125 --> 02:32:22,083
If there are any formalities,
they'll sort it out.

2394
02:32:22,375 --> 02:32:24,708
If you want to match
it with a color chart,

2395
02:32:24,791 --> 02:32:26,416
take some photos in good lighting,
then I'll arrange it.

2396
02:32:26,500 --> 02:32:27,375
She's very cooperative.

2397
02:32:29,500 --> 02:32:30,458
Place the order.

2398
02:32:30,875 --> 02:32:31,750
Sure, sir.

2399
02:32:31,833 --> 02:32:32,708
Thank you, sir.

2400
02:32:37,333 --> 02:32:39,291
It's okay. It's me.

2401
02:32:39,375 --> 02:32:42,458
<i>We're both a little crazy</i>

2402
02:32:42,541 --> 02:32:45,500
<i>Floating like clouds up above</i>

2403
02:32:45,583 --> 02:32:50,958
<i>Come, let's rain down
Come, let's soak in love</i>

2404
02:32:51,041 --> 02:32:56,541
<i>I've met you before</i>

2405
02:32:57,208 --> 02:32:59,250
<i>When our eyes first intertwined</i>

2406
02:33:00,291 --> 02:33:03,416
<i>That's how I felt, you know</i>

2407
02:33:03,500 --> 02:33:08,625
<i>You touched my wounds</i>

2408
02:33:09,625 --> 02:33:15,000
<i>- And my heart... it healed</i>
- Same color.

2409
02:33:59,583 --> 02:34:01,125
Zoya... look at this.

2410
02:34:02,291 --> 02:34:03,708
This sari is 200 years old.

2411
02:34:04,333 --> 02:34:05,833
It's been in the museum
for a hundred years.

2412
02:34:06,708 --> 02:34:07,750
Wear it today.

2413
02:34:09,250 --> 02:34:10,583
I called for the maulvi.

2414
02:34:13,625 --> 02:34:14,708
We're getting married today.

2415
02:34:15,750 --> 02:34:16,750
And forget about this.

2416
02:34:17,333 --> 02:34:18,250
Just forget it.

2417
02:34:23,708 --> 02:34:25,958
I can't marry you.

2418
02:34:29,125 --> 02:34:31,250
And you shouldn't love me either.

2419
02:34:34,583 --> 02:34:36,083
I'm your enemy.

2420
02:34:38,208 --> 02:34:40,750
The heart you've got...

2421
02:34:42,166 --> 02:34:43,625
I had no relationship with that man.

2422
02:34:44,208 --> 02:34:45,291
I lied to you.

2423
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,541
And everything was executed
so meticulously

2424
02:34:51,250 --> 02:34:54,375
that even with your background checks,
no one suspected anything.

2425
02:34:56,500 --> 02:34:57,958
It was all planned.

2426
02:34:59,083 --> 02:35:00,041
By?

2427
02:35:00,791 --> 02:35:01,833
Abrar Haque.

2428
02:35:02,583 --> 02:35:03,541
Where does he live?

2429
02:35:03,875 --> 02:35:04,875
Scotland.

2430
02:35:05,500 --> 02:35:06,500
What is his plan?

2431
02:35:06,583 --> 02:35:08,250
Abrar has a younger brother...

2432
02:35:08,958 --> 02:35:10,958
who idolizes him
and loves him unconditionally.

2433
02:35:11,291 --> 02:35:14,333
He is a professional butcher.
He lives in Istanbul.

2434
02:35:14,541 --> 02:35:16,375
When you murdered his brother,

2435
02:35:16,541 --> 02:35:18,541
he found out everything about you,

2436
02:35:18,625 --> 02:35:20,833
from your school days
to your life in America.

2437
02:35:21,500 --> 02:35:24,750
He got some surgeries done and
transformed himself into another Vijay.

2438
02:35:25,791 --> 02:35:27,666
So when the fake Vijay goes home,

2439
02:35:28,625 --> 02:35:30,583
the family won't suspect a thing.

2440
02:35:31,333 --> 02:35:34,166
After that, when the time was right...

2441
02:35:34,958 --> 02:35:36,708
when you would've been with me...

2442
02:35:38,416 --> 02:35:40,625
he would've killed your father.

2443
02:35:42,666 --> 02:35:45,541
And while dying, Balbir Singh
would've had just one question.

2444
02:35:46,875 --> 02:35:49,375
Why would his son, who'd die for him...

2445
02:35:50,875 --> 02:35:52,000
take his life?

2446
02:35:53,958 --> 02:35:55,125
After that, he would...

2447
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,041
kill your wife, Gitanjali.

2448
02:35:58,875 --> 02:36:01,958
Murder your kids,
your grandfather, your mother,

2449
02:36:02,041 --> 02:36:03,458
everybody in your family.

2450
02:36:04,125 --> 02:36:05,875
As each one of your family members dies,

2451
02:36:06,458 --> 02:36:08,541
they would see the face of the man

2452
02:36:08,958 --> 02:36:11,625
who probably loves them the most.

2453
02:36:12,125 --> 02:36:13,083
Your face.

2454
02:36:14,333 --> 02:36:15,458
Abrar said that after that...

2455
02:36:16,041 --> 02:36:18,625
he wouldn't have to kill you.

2456
02:36:29,875 --> 02:36:30,791
Tell me more.

2457
02:36:31,958 --> 02:36:34,500
Abrar and you might
be somehow related,

2458
02:36:35,083 --> 02:36:38,250
because he calls your dad Balbir Uncle.

2459
02:36:38,708 --> 02:36:40,666
And that explosion
was meant to kill you.

2460
02:36:42,083 --> 02:36:44,041
That explosion was meant
to make you spill the beans.

2461
02:36:47,166 --> 02:36:50,375
And these tears are real,
not like that fake crying the other day.

2462
02:36:51,750 --> 02:36:53,958
I knew who you were from day one.

2463
02:36:55,625 --> 02:36:57,666
So, then what was all this?

2464
02:36:58,458 --> 02:36:59,458
Nothing.

2465
02:37:00,583 --> 02:37:02,750
So, what am I supposed to do now?

2466
02:37:04,083 --> 02:37:04,958
Die.

2467
02:37:13,416 --> 02:37:15,750
The way you love your father...

2468
02:37:16,458 --> 02:37:18,208
shows me how deep
and passionate your love is.

2469
02:37:19,541 --> 02:37:21,708
That's why I'm sure
you can hate just as strongly.

2470
02:37:22,416 --> 02:37:23,583
But if possible...

2471
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:25,541
please don't hate me.

2472
02:37:27,125 --> 02:37:28,041
Please.

2473
02:37:29,083 --> 02:37:30,000
Why shouldn't I?

2474
02:37:30,541 --> 02:37:32,750
Because I love you like crazy.

2475
02:37:33,125 --> 02:37:34,000
Really?

2476
02:37:36,708 --> 02:37:38,000
Come, lick my shoe.

2477
02:37:39,666 --> 02:37:40,541
Come.

2478
02:37:41,833 --> 02:37:42,708
Come!

2479
02:37:59,708 --> 02:38:01,375
- What do we do with the girl?
- Sangram!

2480
02:38:03,041 --> 02:38:04,250
Treat her with respect.

2481
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,125
Whenever and wherever
she decides to go,

2482
02:38:07,375 --> 02:38:08,416
make sure everything's set up for her.

2483
02:38:12,291 --> 02:38:13,541
We were three brothers.

2484
02:38:14,333 --> 02:38:15,875
The eldest one stayed back
in the village.

2485
02:38:16,291 --> 02:38:19,625
My younger brother and I
wanted to conquer the world.

2486
02:38:19,958 --> 02:38:23,458
Together, we started Swastik Steel.

2487
02:38:23,791 --> 02:38:25,041
But after a while,

2488
02:38:25,833 --> 02:38:27,500
his intentions turned sour.

2489
02:38:27,916 --> 02:38:29,916
After dealing with his betrayal
time again...

2490
02:38:31,208 --> 02:38:33,166
I had to kick him out of the company.

2491
02:38:33,541 --> 02:38:35,666
Because of all that disgrace,

2492
02:38:36,541 --> 02:38:38,791
he left the country with his family.

2493
02:38:39,583 --> 02:38:43,458
A few years later,
I heard he set himself on fire...

2494
02:38:44,541 --> 02:38:45,666
and died.

2495
02:38:46,416 --> 02:38:48,291
When Balbir took over Swastik,

2496
02:38:48,791 --> 02:38:52,208
his son came by seeking some help.

2497
02:38:52,375 --> 02:38:55,083
- You mean Abrar Haque's father?
- Yes.

2498
02:38:55,416 --> 02:38:56,708
He didn't come for help, Father.

2499
02:38:56,791 --> 02:38:58,750
He came demanding his share in Swastik,

2500
02:38:59,041 --> 02:39:00,375
even though he had no right to it.

2501
02:39:00,750 --> 02:39:02,500
If he came to me as a brother,

2502
02:39:03,083 --> 02:39:04,416
maybe I wouldn't have
turned him down.

2503
02:39:05,041 --> 02:39:07,291
Abrar's father changed his religion

2504
02:39:07,541 --> 02:39:09,083
and got married a couple of times.

2505
02:39:10,333 --> 02:39:11,583
He's got a bunch of kids

2506
02:39:12,208 --> 02:39:13,541
from different wives.

2507
02:39:13,833 --> 02:39:15,958
Abrar is his firstborn.

2508
02:39:16,375 --> 02:39:17,375
He is your cousin.

2509
02:39:17,583 --> 02:39:18,791
I couldn't care less whose son he is,

2510
02:39:18,875 --> 02:39:21,291
whose grandson he is,
or what his religion is.

2511
02:39:21,416 --> 02:39:22,833
It makes no difference to me, Grandpa.

2512
02:39:22,916 --> 02:39:25,083
You should've told me
about this a long time ago.

2513
02:39:25,291 --> 02:39:28,708
I had no idea this sadness
would cut so deep

2514
02:39:29,208 --> 02:39:31,583
in that kid's heart--

2515
02:39:31,666 --> 02:39:36,500
That kid Abrar Haque wants to kill us,
our whole family!

2516
02:39:36,666 --> 02:39:37,791
Do you know that?

2517
02:39:38,125 --> 02:39:39,208
If you go after him...

2518
02:39:40,208 --> 02:39:42,416
his brothers and his kids
will come after you.

2519
02:39:43,541 --> 02:39:45,541
This whole feud will never end.

2520
02:39:45,708 --> 02:39:48,666
He's your cousin, just like them.
Forgive him.

2521
02:39:48,791 --> 02:39:50,791
This is not the time to forgive.

2522
02:39:51,125 --> 02:39:52,041
Listen, son.

2523
02:39:53,208 --> 02:39:54,333
When you came back,

2524
02:39:54,666 --> 02:39:57,125
you took charge of everything
with force and clarity.

2525
02:39:57,500 --> 02:40:00,083
It's a different matter that
I didn't like your ways back then,

2526
02:40:00,750 --> 02:40:01,750
nor do I like them now.

2527
02:40:05,250 --> 02:40:06,875
You have just recovered, son.

2528
02:40:08,166 --> 02:40:09,833
We can hire people
to handle such stuff.

2529
02:40:10,375 --> 02:40:11,500
Forgive him, son.

2530
02:40:14,041 --> 02:40:15,458
I'll punish him, Grandpa.

2531
02:40:15,916 --> 02:40:17,125
You can forgive him.

2532
02:40:31,875 --> 02:40:32,875
Gitanjali?

2533
02:40:34,750 --> 02:40:35,666
Baby...

2534
02:40:36,083 --> 02:40:37,625
You've finally come home.

2535
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:39,833
I'm starving.

2536
02:40:40,291 --> 02:40:41,541
Come on, come with me.

2537
02:40:43,833 --> 02:40:45,208
I need to talk to you, Gitanjali.

2538
02:40:45,833 --> 02:40:46,791
Wait.

2539
02:40:47,291 --> 02:40:48,416
Why are you giving me that look?

2540
02:40:48,500 --> 02:40:49,500
It's my first time.

2541
02:40:53,541 --> 02:40:54,500
Am I doing it right?

2542
02:40:54,958 --> 02:40:57,458
I have been sleeping with Zoya
for the last few weeks.

2543
02:41:07,041 --> 02:41:09,125
Why am I doing all of this?

2544
02:41:11,541 --> 02:41:13,166
What do you mean by
you've been sleeping with her?

2545
02:41:13,333 --> 02:41:16,666
You got tired and passed out
on the sofa while talking to her?

2546
02:41:17,333 --> 02:41:19,625
I mean we were physically involved
with each other.

2547
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:21,708
What does "physically involved"
even mean?

2548
02:41:21,833 --> 02:41:23,500
You two were wrestling or something?

2549
02:41:23,583 --> 02:41:24,958
You are wrestling champions now?

2550
02:41:26,708 --> 02:41:27,666
What?

2551
02:41:32,291 --> 02:41:33,458
Did you have sex with her?

2552
02:41:34,291 --> 02:41:35,208
Yes.

2553
02:41:36,833 --> 02:41:38,750
Then just say you had sex with her!

2554
02:41:39,500 --> 02:41:41,708
Sleeping with her, physically involved!
What is this nonsense?!

2555
02:41:41,958 --> 02:41:44,208
- Say that you had sex with her!
- Kids are sleeping, Gitanjali.

2556
02:41:44,291 --> 02:41:46,208
Now you are fucking worried
about the kids!

2557
02:41:47,041 --> 02:41:48,791
Fucking stay away from us!

2558
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,333
- Gitanjali...
- Don't touch me.

2559
02:41:54,458 --> 02:41:55,333
Okay.

2560
02:41:55,500 --> 02:41:56,875
She was a mole.

2561
02:41:57,708 --> 02:42:00,750
I made her fall in love with me
so I could know their plan.

2562
02:42:01,083 --> 02:42:02,333
I told you there was someone behind it.

2563
02:42:02,458 --> 02:42:03,708
- She was a mole.
- Did you kiss her?

2564
02:42:05,125 --> 02:42:06,791
Don't just stand there like
a dumb animal!

2565
02:42:06,875 --> 02:42:08,291
- Answer me!
- Yes.

2566
02:42:09,166 --> 02:42:10,125
Did you kiss her?

2567
02:42:10,333 --> 02:42:11,250
Yes.

2568
02:42:11,375 --> 02:42:12,500
How the hell did you kiss her?

2569
02:42:14,041 --> 02:42:16,708
You said you couldn't taste
or smell anything.

2570
02:42:16,958 --> 02:42:19,208
So, how the hell did you kiss her?

2571
02:42:19,625 --> 02:42:20,875
Oh, yeah!

2572
02:42:21,625 --> 02:42:24,416
Your system doesn't turn on
without kissing, right?

2573
02:42:24,791 --> 02:42:28,000
Whatever I did, Gitanjali,
I did it for my father.

2574
02:42:28,500 --> 02:42:31,958
Don't give me that
"I did it for my father" nonsense.

2575
02:42:32,750 --> 02:42:34,791
I don't give a fuck about your father!

2576
02:42:34,875 --> 02:42:36,125
Don't go there, Gitanjali.

2577
02:42:36,208 --> 02:42:38,875
You must have had
a very good time with her, right?

2578
02:42:39,166 --> 02:42:40,458
I have seen the girl.

2579
02:42:40,916 --> 02:42:43,000
She is a very pretty girl.

2580
02:42:43,666 --> 02:42:46,125
She too has a big pelvis.

2581
02:42:46,583 --> 02:42:48,958
She can also accommodate
healthy babies.

2582
02:42:49,208 --> 02:42:51,041
- Go have kids with her!
- No...

2583
02:42:51,125 --> 02:42:52,125
- Let go!
- No, Gitanjali.

2584
02:42:53,375 --> 02:42:55,041
Don't touch me.

2585
02:42:57,083 --> 02:42:58,166
Did you wear a condom?

2586
02:42:59,416 --> 02:43:01,416
Answer me, did you wear a condom?

2587
02:43:02,125 --> 02:43:03,250
Did you wear a condom?

2588
02:43:04,208 --> 02:43:05,083
Wait...

2589
02:43:06,666 --> 02:43:08,458
Did you do this in the US also?

2590
02:43:09,375 --> 02:43:12,541
With the women in your office?
Catherine and Valentina?

2591
02:43:12,666 --> 02:43:13,625
No, never.

2592
02:43:15,708 --> 02:43:17,208
So, you didn't wear a condom?

2593
02:43:19,083 --> 02:43:22,833
You know,
I actually suspected something?

2594
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:27,291
But my love for you
was above my suspicion.

2595
02:43:29,458 --> 02:43:33,916
Tell me something. Did you cuddle
with her after sex like you do with me?

2596
02:43:35,125 --> 02:43:37,041
Or did you rush to the washroom?

2597
02:43:38,541 --> 02:43:39,541
Answer me!

2598
02:43:40,541 --> 02:43:43,541
Where did your inner alpha male go?

2599
02:43:43,833 --> 02:43:44,708
Did he die?

2600
02:43:44,791 --> 02:43:46,750
You're just like everyone else.

2601
02:43:47,333 --> 02:43:48,708
Nothing special.

2602
02:43:49,500 --> 02:43:51,541
Do your brothers know
that you're fucking around?

2603
02:43:52,500 --> 02:43:55,541
Oh, wait! Of course, they know!

2604
02:43:56,916 --> 02:43:59,875
I saw "Sister-in-law 2" on his phone.

2605
02:44:01,625 --> 02:44:03,583
So, basically...

2606
02:44:04,333 --> 02:44:07,208
you fuck anyone you want...

2607
02:44:07,916 --> 02:44:09,416
and she becomes their sister-in-law.

2608
02:44:11,625 --> 02:44:16,333
Sure as hell, your father's status
is not stopping anytime soon!

2609
02:44:16,458 --> 02:44:17,791
Keep your voice down.
The kids are asleep.

2610
02:44:17,875 --> 02:44:18,958
Shut the fuck up!

2611
02:44:19,666 --> 02:44:21,791
I am raising the kids, not you!

2612
02:44:22,458 --> 02:44:25,458
I'll wake them up and tell them
all about their father's new love story!

2613
02:44:25,541 --> 02:44:27,083
- Gitanjali, please...
- Leave!

2614
02:44:27,166 --> 02:44:28,833
- Stop, stop, stop.
- Leave!

2615
02:44:28,916 --> 02:44:30,458
- Please stop, please stop.
- Leave!

2616
02:44:30,541 --> 02:44:32,375
- Leave!
- Please...

2617
02:44:36,958 --> 02:44:37,875
Fine.

2618
02:44:39,708 --> 02:44:41,125
Now go and kill her.

2619
02:44:43,500 --> 02:44:44,750
I can't do that.

2620
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:47,958
Why?

2621
02:44:49,083 --> 02:44:50,041
Do you love her?

2622
02:44:50,875 --> 02:44:52,833
Because of her,
I have found out about our enemy.

2623
02:44:54,750 --> 02:44:57,208
I don't have any feelings
for her, Gitanjali. Please. I love you.

2624
02:44:57,958 --> 02:44:59,458
If you don't love her...

2625
02:45:00,875 --> 02:45:02,541
then why didn't you come home?

2626
02:45:03,500 --> 02:45:05,250
Why weren't you with me?

2627
02:45:06,458 --> 02:45:08,583
I wanted to come to you
with clear conscience.

2628
02:45:08,875 --> 02:45:09,875
Oh, shit.

2629
02:45:12,625 --> 02:45:14,750
So, you starved yourself here

2630
02:45:14,833 --> 02:45:18,416
so you could go and have
a big fucking meal there!

2631
02:45:20,375 --> 02:45:22,083
How many times did you do it with her?

2632
02:45:24,708 --> 02:45:26,083
Is she better than me?

2633
02:45:39,916 --> 02:45:42,000
Why are you coming
and telling me all of this now?

2634
02:45:42,666 --> 02:45:44,791
I'll never be able to forget this.

2635
02:45:45,250 --> 02:45:48,666
I'll sleep with someone and come to you

2636
02:45:49,625 --> 02:45:50,750
and say sorry.

2637
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:53,000
You cool with that?

2638
02:45:53,250 --> 02:45:54,208
Should I do it?

2639
02:45:54,875 --> 02:45:56,416
You won't be able to do it, Gitanjali.

2640
02:45:56,666 --> 02:45:57,791
I will do it.

2641
02:45:58,541 --> 02:46:00,041
For sure, I'll do it.

2642
02:46:00,791 --> 02:46:03,791
I won't let anyone near you.

2643
02:46:04,333 --> 02:46:05,291
You can try it if you want.

2644
02:46:05,666 --> 02:46:09,166
And what's this "I break your toe,
you break my toe" nonsense?

2645
02:46:10,083 --> 02:46:12,500
Gitanjali, you forgave me
for so many murders.

2646
02:46:13,500 --> 02:46:15,708
Can't you forgive me
for sleeping with one woman?

2647
02:46:15,791 --> 02:46:16,833
No...

2648
02:46:18,500 --> 02:46:19,708
I can't.

2649
02:46:20,500 --> 02:46:22,375
I cannot stay with you anymore.

2650
02:46:23,625 --> 02:46:24,833
I need a divorce.

2651
02:46:25,958 --> 02:46:27,083
Divorce is not a solution.

2652
02:46:27,166 --> 02:46:28,583
I don't need a solution.

2653
02:46:29,541 --> 02:46:31,041
I need a divorce.

2654
02:46:31,875 --> 02:46:33,375
I won't divorce you, Gitanjali.

2655
02:46:33,916 --> 02:46:35,125
I can't do this for the kids.

2656
02:46:36,125 --> 02:46:37,583
They can't grow up in a broken home.

2657
02:46:41,416 --> 02:46:43,916
I'll give you one free advice,

2658
02:46:44,333 --> 02:46:45,375
take it from me.

2659
02:46:46,125 --> 02:46:48,958
As long as your father is alive,

2660
02:46:49,416 --> 02:46:53,333
there won't be one day
of peace in your life.

2661
02:46:53,541 --> 02:46:54,916
Whenever your father came home,

2662
02:46:55,750 --> 02:46:58,875
you would run away from school,
often leaving behind your bag.

2663
02:46:58,958 --> 02:47:00,916
You'd get punished by teachers.

2664
02:47:01,166 --> 02:47:02,625
On your father's birthday,

2665
02:47:02,708 --> 02:47:05,500
you'd distribute chocolates like a maniac.

2666
02:47:06,041 --> 02:47:08,625
Your love for your father

2667
02:47:08,791 --> 02:47:11,208
is not just affection, but a damn disease.

2668
02:47:11,916 --> 02:47:14,666
I really wish he had died that day.

2669
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:16,041
What did you say?

2670
02:47:17,625 --> 02:47:20,041
I wish he had died that day.

2671
02:47:32,833 --> 02:47:33,791
End it.

2672
02:47:34,708 --> 02:47:35,708
Shoot.

2673
02:47:43,375 --> 02:47:48,625
<i>One half of this love is mine
And the other is yours</i>

2674
02:47:49,250 --> 02:47:53,416
<i>And that makes a full moon</i>

2675
02:47:54,250 --> 02:48:00,625
<i>A star shines bright for me
Another for you</i>

2676
02:48:01,125 --> 02:48:05,375
<i>While the rest of the sky remains dark</i>

2677
02:48:05,583 --> 02:48:11,125
<i>Could never attach you to those threads
That I tied to the sacred tree</i>

2678
02:48:11,500 --> 02:48:17,625
<i>Even as the kohl streams out of my
Welled-up eyes, such that I don't realize</i>

2679
02:48:17,958 --> 02:48:23,541
<i>This love is the rainbow in the discolor</i>

2680
02:48:23,916 --> 02:48:28,875
<i>While I'm an ascetic
And this love is the holy river</i>

2681
02:48:30,125 --> 02:48:31,791
- What happened?
- What happened, Papa?

2682
02:48:32,125 --> 02:48:34,041
Don't bring the gun to your room.

2683
02:48:34,875 --> 02:48:36,333
Your kids sleep and play here.

2684
02:48:36,541 --> 02:48:37,666
I won't do it again.

2685
02:48:38,208 --> 02:48:39,208
Please go back to bed.

2686
02:48:39,500 --> 02:48:40,958
Mom, we'll talk about this later.

2687
02:48:43,666 --> 02:48:45,166
Gitanjali, are you okay?

2688
02:48:45,958 --> 02:48:46,916
Yes, Uncle.

2689
02:48:47,083 --> 02:48:48,541
Of course, everything's okay, Papa.

2690
02:48:49,041 --> 02:48:50,500
Husband-wife stupid fights.

2691
02:48:50,708 --> 02:48:52,208
You should go to bed.
Good night.

2692
02:48:52,583 --> 02:48:53,541
Mom...

2693
02:48:59,291 --> 02:49:00,208
Let's go, Jyoti.

2694
02:49:09,208 --> 02:49:13,208
<i>I touch my hand to the forehead</i>

2695
02:49:13,500 --> 02:49:19,166
<i>After touching your feet</i>

2696
02:49:21,083 --> 02:49:24,750
<i>I shall bear your complaints</i>

2697
02:49:25,041 --> 02:49:31,125
<i>Like scars on my body</i>

2698
02:49:31,583 --> 02:49:35,833
<i>This once you don't stay
And it won't upset me</i>

2699
02:49:36,208 --> 02:49:41,333
<i>If I could not be yours
I could neither be my own</i>

2700
02:49:41,416 --> 02:49:46,750
<i>You are my whole world
But now, I won't</i>

2701
02:49:46,833 --> 02:49:52,083
<i>I would never, ever come to your city</i>

2702
02:49:52,166 --> 02:49:57,833
<i>The vows that we've taken around the fire
Keep burning within</i>

2703
02:49:58,166 --> 02:50:04,541
<i>Promise me that you'd take
The half-broken promises along</i>

2704
02:50:04,625 --> 02:50:10,208
<i>This love intoxicates
Every vein in my body</i>

2705
02:50:10,583 --> 02:50:15,750
<i>Why is this love only colored with blood?</i>

2706
02:50:21,375 --> 02:50:26,875
<i>Let go of all my memories
In the flowing waters</i>

2707
02:50:27,291 --> 02:50:33,791
<i>I would caress
And not let go of your welled-up eyes</i>

2708
02:50:33,875 --> 02:50:39,250
<i>I'm the ocean and this love is like
A lone bird that flies over</i>

2709
02:50:39,708 --> 02:50:44,750
<i>My heart is in mourning
Yet this love is alive</i>

2710
02:50:44,916 --> 02:50:51,250
<i>This love is the rainbow in the discolor</i>

2711
02:50:51,416 --> 02:50:53,416
Gitanjali, I don't know
if I'll make it back or not.

2712
02:50:55,916 --> 02:50:57,125
But if I don't come back...

2713
02:51:00,333 --> 02:51:01,416
refrain from remarrying.

2714
02:51:48,916 --> 02:51:49,958
Abrar!

2715
02:51:56,125 --> 02:51:57,041
Abrar!

2716
02:52:01,958 --> 02:52:02,875
Abrar!

2717
02:52:11,375 --> 02:52:12,291
Jitta!

2718
02:52:13,500 --> 02:52:14,375
Hey!

2719
02:52:14,458 --> 02:52:16,750
He's here because of the plan you made.

2720
02:52:16,833 --> 02:52:18,250
He is prepared and we are not.

2721
02:52:18,333 --> 02:52:20,750
All our guys are dead,
and they're ready to go down.

2722
02:52:20,875 --> 02:52:23,000
What if you try to kill him
and you die instead?

2723
02:52:23,083 --> 02:52:25,458
What happens to the fire that's been
burning inside since we were kids?

2724
02:52:25,583 --> 02:52:28,416
The sole purpose of his life
is to kill you.

2725
02:52:28,500 --> 02:52:29,875
What is the purpose of your life?

2726
02:52:30,750 --> 02:52:34,041
To eliminate Swastik and Balbir Uncle.

2727
02:52:34,416 --> 02:52:36,583
If you kill Balbir Uncle,
then he'll die on his own.

2728
02:52:39,041 --> 02:52:42,250
I have been your voice since childhood.

2729
02:52:43,416 --> 02:52:44,333
Now you listen to me.

2730
02:52:44,416 --> 02:52:48,916
Brother, we will kill him
in his own house.

2731
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:52,916
Abrar!

2732
02:52:56,791 --> 02:52:57,958
Look, I'm here!

2733
02:53:07,708 --> 02:53:08,583
Hey!

2734
02:53:43,125 --> 02:53:44,000
I seek your blessings, Grandma.

2735
02:53:45,166 --> 02:53:46,083
Where is Abrar?

2736
02:53:46,583 --> 02:53:50,291
The one who forgives is always greater
than the one who kills, son.

2737
02:53:50,833 --> 02:53:53,083
If only you had told that
to your grandson, Grandma,

2738
02:53:53,166 --> 02:53:54,625
things wouldn't have gotten out of hand.

2739
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:55,916
Where is Abrar?

2740
02:53:56,416 --> 02:53:57,833
I don't know, son.

2741
02:53:58,250 --> 02:54:01,708
How long are you brothers
going to keep fighting for?

2742
02:54:02,333 --> 02:54:04,166
- I pray to God...
- Goodbye, Grandma.

2743
02:54:05,083 --> 02:54:06,583
And please stop begging to God.

2744
02:54:07,208 --> 02:54:08,291
Only one of us
will make it out alive today.

2745
02:54:10,291 --> 02:54:11,291
Looks like he ran away.

2746
02:54:12,041 --> 02:54:12,958
Brother!

2747
02:54:28,958 --> 02:54:29,958
Where's Abrar?

2748
02:54:35,291 --> 02:54:36,958
I'll only ask one more time,

2749
02:54:37,083 --> 02:54:39,291
then I'll be taking the three
of you inside, one by one.

2750
02:54:40,416 --> 02:54:41,833
Listen, you fucking psycho!

2751
02:54:42,083 --> 02:54:43,541
We don't know where Abrar is.

2752
02:54:43,958 --> 02:54:45,041
Did I ask you to speak?

2753
02:54:46,666 --> 02:54:47,666
Where's Abrar?

2754
02:54:49,250 --> 02:54:50,208
We don't know where...

2755
02:54:51,250 --> 02:54:52,375
We don't know where he is.

2756
02:54:55,833 --> 02:54:56,833
Oh my God!

2757
02:54:59,208 --> 02:55:01,166
Call 991.
We need an ambulance, please!

2758
02:55:01,500 --> 02:55:03,083
- Please.
- You two have kids of your own, right?

2759
02:55:03,666 --> 02:55:04,958
I'm sure you know what to do.

2760
02:55:07,958 --> 02:55:08,916
My God!

2761
02:55:09,958 --> 02:55:10,833
No...

2762
02:55:16,291 --> 02:55:18,083
- Please, no.
- No.

2763
02:55:18,375 --> 02:55:19,500
Campbeltown Airport.

2764
02:55:19,625 --> 02:55:20,875
No, don't!

2765
02:55:20,958 --> 02:55:22,333
- No!
- Fifty miles from here.

2766
02:55:22,416 --> 02:55:24,500
- No! No!
- He is going to kill us.

2767
02:55:24,708 --> 02:55:26,500
- He is leaving the country.
- No.

2768
02:55:26,833 --> 02:55:27,791
Please...

2769
02:55:29,041 --> 02:55:31,000
Royal, kill them
if the information is not correct.

2770
02:55:31,083 --> 02:55:33,083
They aren't your sisters-in-law.
They're the wives of our enemy.

2771
02:55:36,583 --> 02:55:38,458
Don't worry,
we have called the ambulance.

2772
02:56:43,375 --> 02:56:44,333
Don't go.

2773
02:56:46,083 --> 02:56:46,958
Stop!

2774
02:57:23,166 --> 02:57:24,833
Whether I remain standing or fall down,

2775
02:57:25,041 --> 02:57:27,125
whether I survive or not,
there will be no bullets fired.

2776
02:57:28,416 --> 02:57:29,583
I will be the only one to kill him.

2777
02:57:30,041 --> 02:57:35,583
<i>The raindrops fall and soak the ground</i>

2778
02:57:35,875 --> 02:57:40,666
<i>The raindrops fall and soak the ground</i>

2779
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:44,875
<i>For this day, I've longed to see</i>

2780
02:57:45,208 --> 02:57:49,625
<i>Finally, it has come to be</i>

2781
02:57:49,708 --> 02:57:53,791
<i>For this day, I've longed to see</i>

2782
02:57:54,041 --> 02:57:58,875
<i>Finally, it has come to be</i>

2783
02:58:05,291 --> 02:58:10,583
<i>Today I stare death in the eye</i>

2784
02:58:10,833 --> 02:58:16,000
<i>Today I stare death in the eye</i>

2785
02:58:16,083 --> 02:58:19,750
<i>Only one will survive
It will either be me</i>

2786
02:58:19,833 --> 02:58:24,583
<i>Or the other guy</i>

2787
02:58:24,666 --> 02:58:28,958
<i>Only one will survive
It will either be me</i>

2788
02:58:29,041 --> 02:58:33,833
<i>Or the other guy</i>

2789
02:58:33,916 --> 02:58:39,750
<i>From the burning sun
To the winds so strong</i>

2790
02:58:39,916 --> 02:58:45,541
<i>I'll protect you from the world
I won't let you drown</i>

2791
02:58:45,666 --> 02:58:48,541
<i>I want to be by your side</i>

2792
02:58:48,625 --> 02:58:51,458
<i>I want to hold your hands</i>

2793
02:58:51,541 --> 02:58:58,458
<i>I want to worship you day and night</i>

2794
02:59:18,458 --> 02:59:23,916
<i>No tears will fall from your eyes</i>

2795
02:59:24,250 --> 02:59:29,250
<i>No tears will fall from your eyes</i>

2796
02:59:29,333 --> 02:59:33,166
<i>As long as I am alive</i>

2797
02:59:33,291 --> 02:59:38,125
<i>I promise you'll be fine</i>

2798
02:59:38,958 --> 02:59:44,625
<i>I'll obliterate all in my path</i>

2799
02:59:44,791 --> 02:59:49,708
<i>My sanity will crumble as an aftermath</i>

2800
02:59:49,958 --> 02:59:54,083
<i>If any harm comes your way</i>

2801
02:59:54,166 --> 02:59:58,541
<i>I'll set the world ablaze</i>

2802
02:59:58,833 --> 03:00:02,791
<i>If any harm comes your way</i>

2803
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:08,166
<i>I'll set the world ablaze</i>

2804
03:00:30,333 --> 03:00:35,625
<i>Tears each day, they will ruin me</i>

2805
03:00:36,208 --> 03:00:41,291
<i>Tears each day, they will ruin me</i>

2806
03:00:41,500 --> 03:00:44,958
<i>Papa, your absence</i>

2807
03:00:45,166 --> 03:00:49,750
<i>Will kill me</i>

2808
03:00:50,291 --> 03:00:54,000
<i>Papa, your absence</i>

2809
03:00:54,083 --> 03:00:58,916
<i>Will kill me</i>

2810
03:01:02,791 --> 03:01:08,375
<i>- No tears will fall from your eyes</i>
- Manjot, don't!

2811
03:01:08,625 --> 03:01:13,625
<i>No tears will fall from your eyes</i>

2812
03:01:13,708 --> 03:01:17,666
<i>As long as I am alive</i>

2813
03:01:17,750 --> 03:01:22,500
<i>I promise you'll be fine</i>

2814
03:01:23,250 --> 03:01:28,916
<i>I'll obliterate all in my path</i>

2815
03:01:29,083 --> 03:01:34,083
<i>My sanity will crumble as an aftermath</i>

2816
03:01:34,375 --> 03:01:38,375
<i>If any harm comes your way</i>

2817
03:01:38,500 --> 03:01:43,125
<i>I'll set the world ablaze</i>

2818
03:01:43,208 --> 03:01:47,083
<i>If any harm comes your way</i>

2819
03:01:47,333 --> 03:01:52,916
<i>I'll set the world ablaze</i>

2820
03:02:04,875 --> 03:02:08,958
<i>When the first bullet hit me,
I could hear you scream.</i>

2821
03:02:09,958 --> 03:02:11,625
<i>And when the second bullet hit me...</i>

2822
03:02:12,458 --> 03:02:13,500
<i>I realized...</i>

2823
03:02:14,458 --> 03:02:15,333
<i>I was alone.</i>

2824
03:02:15,416 --> 03:02:20,958
<i>You're my faith, my religion
I'd do anything for you</i>

2825
03:02:21,208 --> 03:02:25,875
<i>You're my faith, my religion
I'd do anything for you</i>

2826
03:02:26,375 --> 03:02:29,916
<i>Papa, I'm your heartbeat</i>

2827
03:02:30,125 --> 03:02:34,666
<i>You are my life, it's true</i>

2828
03:02:34,916 --> 03:02:38,666
<i>Papa, I'm your heartbeat</i>

2829
03:02:38,875 --> 03:02:43,875
<i>You are my life, it's true</i>

2830
03:02:44,625 --> 03:02:45,666
What's going on?

2831
03:02:46,708 --> 03:02:49,000
They've been hitting each other
for the last two hours.

2832
03:02:54,791 --> 03:02:56,125
That woman had two boys.

2833
03:02:58,333 --> 03:02:59,500
Identical twins.

2834
03:03:00,791 --> 03:03:05,750
<i>All the fiery clouds, I made them flee</i>

2835
03:03:06,416 --> 03:03:11,500
<i>All fears in us
I erased them to set ourselves free</i>

2836
03:03:11,583 --> 03:03:13,583
Grandpa said you are my flesh and blood.

2837
03:03:14,041 --> 03:03:15,166
You are my brother.

2838
03:03:15,916 --> 03:03:17,041
If I stop...

2839
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:19,000
will you also stop?

2840
03:03:21,291 --> 03:03:22,166
Tell me.

2841
03:03:22,250 --> 03:03:24,041
My brother can't talk!

2842
03:03:24,500 --> 03:03:26,166
Hey!

2843
03:03:33,916 --> 03:03:35,916
My brother can't hear!

2844
03:03:39,666 --> 03:03:40,916
Brother, use sign language
to communicate.

2845
03:03:41,208 --> 03:03:42,250
I know sign language.

2846
03:03:42,541 --> 03:03:43,458
Tell me...

2847
03:03:43,666 --> 03:03:45,166
Tell me that you won't go
after my father.

2848
03:03:45,500 --> 03:03:46,458
Just say it.

2849
03:03:46,625 --> 03:03:48,041
From the time I was a kid...

2850
03:03:48,791 --> 03:03:51,500
I never got to spend
a single day with my father.

2851
03:03:51,833 --> 03:03:53,500
Say that you will stop.

2852
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:54,875
Yes?

2853
03:03:58,875 --> 03:03:59,833
Will you stop?

2854
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:17,208
<i>This is a sorrow I shall always bear</i>

2855
03:04:17,625 --> 03:04:22,333
<i>This is a sorrow I shall always bear</i>

2856
03:04:22,708 --> 03:04:26,750
<i>The one I must harm is a kin</i>

2857
03:04:27,083 --> 03:04:31,583
<i>It's so hard to bear</i>

2858
03:04:31,666 --> 03:04:35,541
<i>The one I must harm is a kin</i>

2859
03:04:35,833 --> 03:04:40,666
<i>It's so hard to bear</i>

2860
03:04:41,083 --> 03:04:46,541
<i>The burden lifted
I feel so weightless and light</i>

2861
03:04:46,958 --> 03:04:51,958
<i>The burden lifted
I feel so weightless and light</i>

2862
03:04:52,083 --> 03:04:55,750
<i>Losing you brought an end</i>

2863
03:04:56,000 --> 03:05:00,750
<i>To death's fright</i>

2864
03:05:00,875 --> 03:05:04,583
<i>Losing you brought an end</i>

2865
03:05:04,875 --> 03:05:10,791
<i>To death's fright</i>

2866
03:05:24,041 --> 03:05:25,041
Papa!

2867
03:05:28,208 --> 03:05:29,250
Papa!

2868
03:05:42,416 --> 03:05:43,375
Papa!

2869
03:06:12,875 --> 03:06:14,250
Gitanjali, what are you wearing?

2870
03:06:14,750 --> 03:06:17,458
Sweetie, it's Diwali night. At least
wear that silk sari Mom gave you.

2871
03:06:17,625 --> 03:06:18,875
- We need to talk.
- I know.

2872
03:06:19,166 --> 03:06:20,875
You always wanted
to go back to the US, right?

2873
03:06:21,375 --> 03:06:23,291
Pack your bags.
We'll leave tomorrow.

2874
03:06:23,958 --> 03:06:25,250
We'll take Papa with us too.

2875
03:06:27,916 --> 03:06:29,041
Happy Diwali, Papa.

2876
03:06:30,166 --> 03:06:31,208
Happy Diwali, son.

2877
03:06:32,125 --> 03:06:35,625
Papa, I think you should take
a two-year vacation.

2878
03:06:36,500 --> 03:06:39,541
Let's go to America.
Mom, Roop, Reet... all of us.

2879
03:06:40,333 --> 03:06:43,166
Papa, I've always wanted
to spend time with you.

2880
03:06:43,833 --> 03:06:45,125
That's all I want in my life.

2881
03:06:45,958 --> 03:06:46,958
Let's go on a holiday.

2882
03:06:50,166 --> 03:06:51,083
What is this?

2883
03:06:53,375 --> 03:06:57,083
Balbir Singh, 68, Acute Lymphoblastic...

2884
03:06:57,500 --> 03:06:58,666
Leukemia, fourth stage.

2885
03:06:59,666 --> 03:07:00,625
What is this?
When did it happen?

2886
03:07:00,708 --> 03:07:01,666
I just got to know yesterday.

2887
03:07:03,250 --> 03:07:05,791
The doctors say I only have
three to six months left.

2888
03:07:06,041 --> 03:07:07,250
Papa, nothing will happen to you.

2889
03:07:07,500 --> 03:07:09,666
Leukemia is very common in America.

2890
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:12,208
I have many friends at
John Hopkins Hospital.

2891
03:07:12,333 --> 03:07:14,416
We'll get you the best treatment
and clinical trials,

2892
03:07:14,625 --> 03:07:15,833
but we'll have to leave tonight.

2893
03:07:15,958 --> 03:07:17,041
I'll make some calls, okay?

2894
03:07:17,583 --> 03:07:18,708
Be practical!

2895
03:07:19,333 --> 03:07:21,333
This is not something
you can solve with a gun and violence.

2896
03:07:21,416 --> 03:07:23,208
- I don't want a lecture on practicality.
- Listen--

2897
03:07:23,291 --> 03:07:25,041
- I don't want a lecture on practicality!
- Sit.

2898
03:07:25,750 --> 03:07:27,041
You are talking about dying, right?

2899
03:07:28,125 --> 03:07:31,250
It's because of my gun and violence
that we are still thriving.

2900
03:07:32,166 --> 03:07:34,708
You had made an enemy your son-in-law
and let him stay in the house.

2901
03:07:34,875 --> 03:07:37,458
You can slit as many throats
as you want and blame it on me.

2902
03:07:38,333 --> 03:07:39,291
I know...

2903
03:07:39,916 --> 03:07:41,916
everything you have done so far...

2904
03:07:42,541 --> 03:07:45,375
is a reflection of your innate inclination
towards a life of crime.

2905
03:07:47,500 --> 03:07:48,541
This is good, Papa.

2906
03:07:51,625 --> 03:07:54,916
I thought that this news
would have completely shattered you.

2907
03:07:55,791 --> 03:07:56,708
This is awesome.

2908
03:07:57,666 --> 03:07:58,750
Stay resolute, Papa.

2909
03:07:59,791 --> 03:08:00,875
I won't waver either.

2910
03:08:01,875 --> 03:08:03,458
Twenty years ago, you told me that

2911
03:08:04,208 --> 03:08:06,000
if you stopped supporting me,
I would end up in jail.

2912
03:08:06,083 --> 03:08:07,125
Well, go ahead!

2913
03:08:07,541 --> 03:08:08,666
I don't mind ending up in jail.

2914
03:08:08,833 --> 03:08:10,958
Nothing has changed between us
in these 20 years.

2915
03:08:11,166 --> 03:08:12,666
- Vijay!
- Mom, you go outside.

2916
03:08:13,208 --> 03:08:14,833
This is a personal moment
between Papa and me.

2917
03:08:14,916 --> 03:08:15,791
Hey!

2918
03:08:15,875 --> 03:08:17,625
- Jyoti, come and sit here.
- No, Mom.

2919
03:08:17,708 --> 03:08:19,166
- Come and sit here.
- Mom, please.

2920
03:08:19,833 --> 03:08:22,750
I have got this chance
after 36 years. Leave!

2921
03:08:22,916 --> 03:08:24,125
What else is there to say anyway?

2922
03:08:25,166 --> 03:08:26,208
What more do you want?

2923
03:08:28,750 --> 03:08:30,416
Alright, Papa, let's play a game.

2924
03:08:31,041 --> 03:08:32,875
I'll be you, Papa,
and you be me, your son.

2925
03:08:33,166 --> 03:08:34,125
Stay with me.

2926
03:08:34,208 --> 03:08:35,750
We can't go through my entire life

2927
03:08:36,041 --> 03:08:38,083
since you don't have much time left.

2928
03:08:38,166 --> 03:08:39,541
So, let's replay just one day, okay?

2929
03:08:39,750 --> 03:08:40,708
Which day?

2930
03:08:42,083 --> 03:08:43,958
Remember when I was in the fifth grade

2931
03:08:44,041 --> 03:08:46,083
and there was a Michael Jackson
concert happening in Bombay?

2932
03:08:46,166 --> 03:08:47,875
You knew what a big fan I was
of Michael Jackson.

2933
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:50,333
All my friends were going,
and you organized tickets for me.

2934
03:08:50,458 --> 03:08:52,458
But I didn't go
because it was your birthday.

2935
03:08:53,250 --> 03:08:55,375
Somehow your birthday always brings
some crazy energy. God knows why!

2936
03:08:55,666 --> 03:08:58,166
Something always happens
between us on November 29th.

2937
03:08:58,250 --> 03:08:59,333
Papa, stay with me.

2938
03:08:59,583 --> 03:09:00,708
Let's act out that day, okay?

2939
03:09:00,875 --> 03:09:04,208
You came home, and I kept asking,
"Papa, where were you?"

2940
03:09:04,333 --> 03:09:06,791
And you just said, "I was busy working."

2941
03:09:06,916 --> 03:09:09,000
Let's replay that day.
You don't have to do much.

2942
03:09:09,083 --> 03:09:10,791
Just say, "Papa, Papa..."

2943
03:09:10,875 --> 03:09:12,708
and I'll pretend to be you, okay?

2944
03:09:12,791 --> 03:09:13,916
Do it with conviction, Papa.

2945
03:09:14,166 --> 03:09:15,416
It's my only chance, okay?

2946
03:09:20,916 --> 03:09:21,875
Action, Papa.

2947
03:09:23,916 --> 03:09:24,791
Papa...

2948
03:09:27,208 --> 03:09:28,166
Papa...

2949
03:09:30,875 --> 03:09:33,583
- Papa...
- I can hear you. I'm not deaf!

2950
03:09:35,833 --> 03:09:38,666
Why isn't the stock report file
of Swastik on my desk?

2951
03:09:39,041 --> 03:09:40,375
I want it immediately! Now!

2952
03:09:40,958 --> 03:09:44,208
- Papa, I...
- Jyoti, take him inside!

2953
03:09:47,458 --> 03:09:48,750
Mishra isn't answering his phone.

2954
03:09:49,333 --> 03:09:51,583
The stock market has crashed.

2955
03:09:51,833 --> 03:09:52,750
Papa, I...

2956
03:09:54,291 --> 03:09:55,416
Don't wipe your face, Papa.

2957
03:09:55,791 --> 03:09:56,833
Don't touch your face.

2958
03:09:57,583 --> 03:09:58,833
I didn't touch mine either.

2959
03:10:00,375 --> 03:10:01,416
You are doing well, Papa.

2960
03:10:02,083 --> 03:10:03,041
You are doing well.

2961
03:10:03,375 --> 03:10:04,291
Continue.

2962
03:10:05,583 --> 03:10:07,291
- I come home after two weeks...
- Papa, it's your birthday.

2963
03:10:07,625 --> 03:10:08,666
and he won't stop talking.

2964
03:10:08,750 --> 03:10:10,166
- Papa, it's your birthday.
- What?!

2965
03:10:10,625 --> 03:10:13,750
- Papa, I kept waiting--
- Vijay, think beyond birthday!

2966
03:10:14,541 --> 03:10:18,291
Do you want to achieve something in life
or just keep following me like a dog?

2967
03:10:18,750 --> 03:10:21,166
"Papa! Papa! Papa!"

2968
03:10:21,458 --> 03:10:24,291
Papa, do you remember
you even slapped me that day?

2969
03:10:24,791 --> 03:10:25,666
Remember?

2970
03:10:25,833 --> 03:10:28,666
But now, we're just acting,
and I can't hit you back.

2971
03:10:28,750 --> 03:10:30,208
So, what should I do?

2972
03:10:30,541 --> 03:10:31,416
Yes!

2973
03:10:32,666 --> 03:10:33,541
Vijay...

2974
03:10:34,375 --> 03:10:35,291
Enough, Vijay.

2975
03:10:36,791 --> 03:10:37,791
Enough, Vijay.

2976
03:10:39,083 --> 03:10:40,583
Are you giving up so easily?

2977
03:10:42,250 --> 03:10:44,041
Papa, you know that
you are the greatest for me.

2978
03:10:44,916 --> 03:10:46,666
But you are not the best father
in the world.

2979
03:10:48,125 --> 03:10:50,291
I believe I am the greatest son
in the world.

2980
03:10:51,916 --> 03:10:54,000
Do you know why I love you so much?

2981
03:10:57,208 --> 03:10:58,416
There's no answer to that.

2982
03:11:00,083 --> 03:11:01,208
When you came back...

2983
03:11:02,791 --> 03:11:04,083
I was so happy.

2984
03:11:05,125 --> 03:11:07,083
I wanted to pass on
the reins of Swastik to you...

2985
03:11:08,791 --> 03:11:10,083
but you started a war.

2986
03:11:10,250 --> 03:11:11,958
Who was managing everything back then?

2987
03:11:13,083 --> 03:11:15,416
If Varun had told me that Papa is safe,

2988
03:11:15,583 --> 03:11:17,125
if everything seemed clear to me,

2989
03:11:17,291 --> 03:11:19,291
then I would've left after you recovered,

2990
03:11:19,666 --> 03:11:20,708
and not done all this.

2991
03:11:21,166 --> 03:11:23,416
Papa, I had a very happy
and settled married life in America.

2992
03:11:24,208 --> 03:11:26,000
I didn't come back
for my share in Swastik.

2993
03:11:26,083 --> 03:11:27,666
Swastik was my life.

2994
03:11:29,333 --> 03:11:31,375
I wanted to give you my empire,

2995
03:11:31,750 --> 03:11:34,125
and you just walked away,
just like that.

2996
03:11:35,125 --> 03:11:38,291
For eight years, I didn't talk to you.
Couldn't you have reached out to me?

2997
03:11:38,958 --> 03:11:40,666
Your mother kept in touch with you.

2998
03:11:40,791 --> 03:11:41,708
You had kids.

2999
03:11:42,125 --> 03:11:44,583
Everyone in the house knew their names
and had seen their photos, except me.

3000
03:11:45,291 --> 03:11:46,958
"I am your bastard son",

3001
03:11:47,583 --> 03:11:48,708
that's what you said!

3002
03:11:49,583 --> 03:11:50,791
I am your father!

3003
03:11:51,833 --> 03:11:54,375
I am your father, and you are my son!

3004
03:11:54,958 --> 03:11:56,416
And this is not a game!

3005
03:11:57,416 --> 03:11:59,125
What if I ask you all these question?

3006
03:12:00,791 --> 03:12:03,083
Papa, from which US university
did I graduate?

3007
03:12:03,833 --> 03:12:04,708
Forget it.

3008
03:12:05,458 --> 03:12:06,958
Where did I live in Virginia?

3009
03:12:08,208 --> 03:12:09,416
What was my designation?

3010
03:12:12,500 --> 03:12:13,458
Leave it, Papa.

3011
03:12:14,958 --> 03:12:16,166
You're going to win again.

3012
03:12:17,250 --> 03:12:21,791
Because if I start complaining,
you'll probably die before I finish.

3013
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:26,250
Just like always,
never letting me finish my thoughts.

3014
03:12:36,041 --> 03:12:36,916
Vijay.

3015
03:12:38,750 --> 03:12:39,625
Vijay...

3016
03:12:41,041 --> 03:12:42,250
I made a mistake, son.

3017
03:12:43,208 --> 03:12:45,125
I shouldn't have pushed you away from me.

3018
03:12:46,208 --> 03:12:47,541
I should have put everything aside...

3019
03:12:48,916 --> 03:12:50,500
and talked to you.

3020
03:12:52,208 --> 03:12:53,375
Not as a father...

3021
03:12:54,875 --> 03:12:56,000
but as a friend.

3022
03:12:57,750 --> 03:12:58,958
My punishment is that...

3023
03:13:00,583 --> 03:13:02,833
now I don't have the right or the time...

3024
03:13:03,958 --> 03:13:05,166
to regret.

3025
03:13:08,916 --> 03:13:10,875
But please, never forgive me.

3026
03:13:12,791 --> 03:13:16,208
Remember me however you want.

3027
03:13:23,125 --> 03:13:24,000
Vijay!

3028
03:13:26,208 --> 03:13:27,791
In the next life, you will be my father

3029
03:13:28,666 --> 03:13:29,875
and I will be your son.

3030
03:13:30,875 --> 03:13:34,541
So, don't make
the same stupid mistakes I made.

3031
03:13:35,791 --> 03:13:37,125
And in the life after that,

3032
03:13:37,833 --> 03:13:40,875
I will be your father again,
and you will be my son.

3033
03:13:41,750 --> 03:13:44,458
And you'll see how much I truly love you.

3034
03:13:45,375 --> 03:13:46,833
Then you can proudly say...

3035
03:13:47,791 --> 03:13:51,083
"My father is the best father
in the world."

3036
03:13:54,375 --> 03:13:58,458
{\an8}<i>There is one star in my sky</i>

3037
03:13:58,708 --> 03:14:02,458
{\an8}<i>And that one star is you</i>

3038
03:14:03,041 --> 03:14:07,416
<i>I have no one but you</i>

3039
03:14:07,500 --> 03:14:11,333
<i>- You are my whole world</i>
- Mishra Uncle...

3040
03:14:11,541 --> 03:14:15,875
<i>- I put you in a place...</i>
- What do I do now?

3041
03:14:16,208 --> 03:14:20,083
<i>Where no one is</i>

3042
03:14:20,750 --> 03:14:22,916
<i>Papa, my life</i>

3043
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:29,208
<i>Keep your hand
On my head every moment</i>

3044
03:14:29,625 --> 03:14:33,791
<i>Papa, my life, walk with me</i>

3045
03:14:33,958 --> 03:14:37,708
<i>You are the stone in every river</i>

3046
03:14:38,041 --> 03:14:40,083
<i>For me</i>

3047
03:14:40,291 --> 03:14:46,916
<i>These methods stop with you</i>

3048
03:14:52,041 --> 03:14:53,000
Vijay...

3049
03:14:54,666 --> 03:14:55,791
Vijay, I'm leaving you.

3050
03:14:57,000 --> 03:14:59,250
I'm heading back to the US with the kids.

3051
03:15:00,333 --> 03:15:01,291
Vijay!

3052
03:15:03,125 --> 03:15:04,041
Vijay!

3053
03:15:13,500 --> 03:15:17,875
<i>You are constantly in my heart</i>

3054
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:21,916
<i>Just like my heartbeat</i>

3055
03:15:22,291 --> 03:15:26,708
<i>You are with me in my head
No matter where I go</i>

3056
03:15:26,833 --> 03:15:30,625
<i>Whether you are there or not</i>

3057
03:15:30,958 --> 03:15:35,208
<i>You are always there in my sight</i>

3058
03:15:35,416 --> 03:15:39,458
<i>Wherever I go</i>

3059
03:15:40,041 --> 03:15:42,166
<i>Papa, my life</i>

3060
03:15:42,250 --> 03:15:48,416
<i>Keep your hand
On my head every moment</i>

3061
03:15:48,875 --> 03:15:53,041
<i>Papa, my life, walk with me</i>

3062
03:15:53,250 --> 03:15:57,083
<i>You are the stone in every river</i>

3063
03:15:57,375 --> 03:15:59,250
<i>For me</i>

3064
03:15:59,583 --> 03:16:05,666
<i>These methods stop with you</i>

3065
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:07,041
<i>Abrar has a younger brother...</i>

3066
03:17:07,791 --> 03:17:09,916
<i>who idolizes him
and loves him unconditionally.</i>

3067
03:17:10,375 --> 03:17:12,000
<i>He is a professional butcher.</i>

3068
03:17:12,583 --> 03:17:13,958
<i>He lives in Istanbul.</i>

3069
03:17:17,541 --> 03:17:20,333
<i>He got some surgeries done and
transformed himself into another Vijay.</i>

3070
03:18:42,833 --> 03:18:43,708
What happened?

3071
03:18:50,083 --> 03:18:51,958
I can't handle blood, Aziz.

3072
03:18:56,208 --> 03:18:57,958
This wasn't just because of that, right?

3073
03:19:09,208 --> 03:19:13,041
We won't know until the baby is born
whether it's Vijay's or mine.

3074
03:19:13,416 --> 03:19:14,958
If the baby doesn't look like me...

3075
03:19:15,708 --> 03:19:16,916
then it's mine.

3076
03:19:22,500 --> 03:19:24,500
Sister-in-law, I want to marry you.

3077
03:19:26,708 --> 03:19:27,666
You have two kids.

3078
03:19:28,541 --> 03:19:30,083
I will take full responsibility.

3079
03:19:31,541 --> 03:19:32,625
I hope you are okay with it.

3080
03:19:35,291 --> 03:19:36,166
Abid?

3081
03:19:38,000 --> 03:19:38,875
Zoya?

3082
03:19:39,708 --> 03:19:40,625
Good.

3083
03:19:54,166 --> 03:19:56,666
You were the one singing while
he was taking my brother's life, right?

3084
03:19:57,750 --> 03:19:59,583
And you were the one who
handed him a knife at the runway.
