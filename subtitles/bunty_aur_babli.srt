2
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,320
This is lndia...

3
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,053
the land that glistens, shines...

4
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:09,063
the land bedecked
with the glitter of dreams...

5
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,600
beckoning you...

6
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,102
if you nurse a hunger,
she says, here...

7
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,468
you'll find
what satisfies it. Come...

8
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:15,665
rub your shoulders
till they're blue...

9
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:18,633
with fame, wealth, power, glory...

10
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:20,606
and your life becomes...

11
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,112
a sunlit dream
you never want to wake out of

12
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:28,750
Yes, this is lndia...a dream...

13
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,922
that Bunty and Babli dreamt
every night of their lives

14
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,892
And this is the lndia they live in...

15
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:37,963
an lndia that says...

16
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:41,600
your dreams should end
where your arms do...

17
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,465
and you should feel only
as much hunger as you can satisfy...

18
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:46,468
step forward....

19
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:49,141
but only when
you're in step with the others...

20
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:52,834
float to the top but not
at the cost of anyone else

21
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,514
love, compassion,
honesty, respect...

22
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,444
are what matter most...

23
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,244
this too is lndia...

24
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:06,348
the lndia Bunty and Babli grew up in

25
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,384
but didn't feel like they belonged to

26
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,130
This world we live in
has two kinds of people

27
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,703
One, the kind that does
just one thing all their lives and...

28
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:18,495
the kind that does...

29
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,105
just about everything in one life

30
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,777
l didn't say that, they did and they
didn't just say it, they lived it

31
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,137
And how ! No one ever lived life...

32
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,178
like they lived theirs and perhaps...

33
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,043
no one ever will

34
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:35,512
So much excitement...
so much adventure, so many joys...

35
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,519
all in one single lifetime...

36
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:43,821
no one could have imagined it possible,
not even them. Or then again...

37
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,162
maybe they could have

Small town cocoons
These dull afternoons...

l want to pack them up

The river lies low...

Call me, oh, watch me go...

Stand aside, make way for me
Those clouds are mine to hold

48
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:40,604
Burnt in black on a white sheet sky
l'll write my name, big and bold

49
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:44,476
On the street
that curves around the moon...

50
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:48,450
At the bend is where l'll stay

51
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:57,154
On the street that curves around

The cool whispers of the wind

66
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:09,995
Ride across the earth, the sky
Leave the world behind, unhinged

67
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:18,035
My forehead adorned, my jewel, the moon
l can't walk unnoticed amidst the stars

68
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:26,110
My forehead shorn of all but the moon
l can't live unnoticed up here with stars

72

lt's not going to come.
- lt will

73
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,191
lt won't.- lt will

74
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,693
Boy, go down to the tap
and have your bath

75
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,392
Or you'll be standing at
the end of a very long line

76
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,837
No dearth of people
wanting to get into a line

77
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,100
What do you mean?
- What l mean Ma is...

78
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:09,714
this world has two kinds of people,
one, those who line up before taps...

79
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,545
and two, those who make themselves taps
so they won't need to stand in any line

80
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,715
l happen to belong to the latter.
- You don't belong anywhere

81
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,391
You've already spent
forty rupees on this gibberish

82
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:23,358
How much more will you blow up?
- Ma, how many times do l tell you...

83
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,964
l'm not spending anything.
This is an investment

84
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,963
For fifty bucks, this shower is
up and running... then l'll fix it...

85
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:33,935
to the community tap and everyone's
willing to part with fifty paise...

86
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,804
to bathe in a shower.lf five people
use it everyday, that's 2.50

87
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,044
ln twenty days, fifty bucks are back

88
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,271
That's 2.50 in profits
everyday from each shower

89
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,415
Stop. You're making my head spin

90
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:51,485
The problem with this Fursatganj,
talking sense sends heads spinning

91
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,151
Anyway, do you remember
my chit fund idea ?

92
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,386
A finance company in Lucknow...
- l don't want to know anything !

93
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,361
lf you don't stop now
you'll surely go to jail some day

94
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,808
There... l told you it'll come

95
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,412
Of course it will. Why won't it ?

96
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,082
How else will he drown his future ?

97
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:23,279
Why... oh today was your interview
for the railway job ! You didn't go ?

98
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,788
l went ! Pandey'ji
called to say that...

99
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,788
before l recommend my son
for another interview...

100
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:33,290
l should at least make sure that he
drags himself there on his own two legs

101
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,624
l've lain my thirty five years
in the service on the line...

102
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,326
and made him agree for
another chance tomorrow

103
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,600
Thank God he agreed

104
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:47,138
How does that matter?
l need to agree too

105
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:50,838
Rakesh, we're trying to be serious here

106
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,880
l told him l don't want to be
a ticket collector

107
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:57,021
So what do you want to be ?
The maker of failed schemes, for life ?

108
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,315
All of Fursatganj thinks
you're a deluded Don Quixote

109
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,960
You want them to coin new
euphemisms for you ? Everyone...

110
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:07,064
Fursatganj is packed with asses.
And all asses can do is...

111
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:13,171
chew the cud and bear the burden.
l wasn't born to do either

112
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,372
Oh you'll become a Birla-Tata-Ambani?
- Why can't l be ?

113
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,804
They didn't fall out of the sky.
They too were born here on this earth

114
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,947
At least they were born here. You belong
to a different planet altogether!

115
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,484
Dad, don't get me started again.
l've made up my mind

116
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,919
l'm not going to waste my entire life
trapped in a job

117
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:32,920
Look here

118
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:37,255
l've spent thirty five years in this job
You think my life's been a total waste ?

119
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:49,736
After a lifetime of service,
does the government even bother...

120
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:53,173
about your opinion?
After thirty five years of...

121
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,509
shuttling up and down that same
train route, does even one passenger...

122
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,412
from all those thousand trips remember
what you look like in your shabby coat ?

123
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,921
When you die, will anybody except
Ma and l, shed a single tear ?

124
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,614
Will the railways take a day off ?

125
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:15,766
Dad your life means nothing. There's
no respect, no fun, no meaning

126
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:27,104
When l walk wearing this shabby coat,
that seems to embarrass you so much...

127
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:34,285
people stop in their tracks
to pay me their respects

128
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:42,216
Shopkeepers are up on their feet
to attend to Mr Ticket Collector

129
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:51,533
Why?
Because my poor black cotton coat...

130
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:58,008
is untainted by ill-gotten gain...

131
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,611
it is the mark of my esteem

132
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,315
Rakesh...

133
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,153
the interview is at
9 o'clock tomorrow morning

134
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,626
Get there in time.
Or get lost

135
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:22,830
Find a meaning for your life
wherever you want, however you want to

136
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:30,138
Because we can't live up
to your high expectations...

137
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,480
we're sorry

138
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,163
There's something about you baby

139
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:04,970
You too

140
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,945
You're not half bad either

141
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,348
Go easy on the lipstick...

142
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:14,383
it shouldn't look too tacky.
And one thing you ought to know

143
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:18,089
A ragged skirt doesn't make you sexy

144
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:23,325
lt's what's in your eyes... like in mine

145
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,496
Dear God...

146
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:29,361
my daughter has gone insane!
- lf worshipping my beauty...

147
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:32,128
is tantamount to being insane,
then l plead insanity

148
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:36,570
lf craving for fame is insane
then l plead insanity

149
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,938
lf the desire to renounce this
pigeon-hole Pankinagar...

150
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,838
for the great wide marvellous
world outside is insane...

151
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,882
then l plead complete insanity

152
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,180
And you are driving me nuts.
Take off that shirt

153
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,013
l'm sorry, l don't believe
beauty needs cheap exposure

154
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,352
One tight slap
and all your beliefs will change

155
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,856
You've ruined all his best shirts

156
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:03,626
Ruined ? These shirts will fetch
millions. There'll be grand auctions

157
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:08,398
Supermodel Vimmi's shirts ! The ones
she wore when she dreamt of success

158
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:14,977
Ladies and gents, do l hear
a hundred thousand... One...Two... Three !

159
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,579
Jassi, where's my shirt ?

160
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,550
Right here...

161
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,712
What's she up to now?
- She's just fooling around...

162
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,050
Fooling around...?
Go on, enjoy yourself...

163
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,317
till the time you can

164
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:35,233
What are you trying to do?
- Trying to be coy about my marriage

165
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,761
But doesn't seem to be
coming too naturally

166
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,233
Your father isn't joking.
You won't find a man like Surinder...

167
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:44,068
even if you turn Kanpur and Lucknow
inside out. Count your blessings...

168
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:48,144
a head clerk has fallen into your lap
that too in a place like Pankinagar

169
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:52,347
Papa'ji, l think...
l'll run away from home

170
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:57,750
Listen to her ! l kept telling you
we shouldn't allow cable tv in her room

171
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,357
All day-and-nights she's whispering
to those naked witches on her walls

172
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,292
And now she even wants to run away.
- No harm in that, no ?

173
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,526
You go ahead, run away

174
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:13,403
But see, it's 1 1 o'clock.
Eat lunch before running

175
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,369
What are you saying?
- l don't want a weight on my mind...

176
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:17,974
my daughter running away
on an empty stomach ?

177
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,607
l'm warning you, l'll really run away
if you even think of marrying me off...

178
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,442
to that... that ten out of ten!
- Ten out of ten ?

179
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,051
That ass always got ten out of ten in
every godforsaken subject... what a nerd

180
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:33,615
Who wouldn't want to marry such a man?
- Then why don't you ? Spare me

181
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:38,556
Now get out of that outfit
and help your mother with the cooking

182
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,289
l've called them to lunch tomorrow

183
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,903
l want things to be finalised
before the evening tea hits the table

184
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:52,232
Enough. Don't make me hurt you

185
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,886
Why are you taking them off?
- You don't know why ?

186
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,194
lt's time you realised that you can't
live like you want to anymore

187
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:19,838
You'll have to adjust to
your new family's ways

188
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:25,907
You'll eat, drink, walk, sleep
the way they want you to

189
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:33,017
Look, l'm your mother.
All l want is to see you happy

190
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,246
Forget all of this

191
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:45,326
You're leaving this for a new world.
- lt feels like l'm leaving the world

192
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:51,101
The more you think about it
the more you'll hurt

193
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:55,170
Just do as l say.
You'll learn to be happy

194
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:06,041
Mummy, if l request Papa'ji not to
marry me off just yet, will he listen ?

195
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:13,714
The facial cream is on the washbasin.
Don't forget to apply it

196
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,880
Tea... piping hot tea...

197
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,747
A little extra milk
never killed a cow.- Sir ?

198
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:48,758
l said, two extra teaspoonfuls of milk
never killed the calf's mother. Pour

199
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,088
There's more milk than water in it, sir.
- More milk, l said

200
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,628
Hey give back my glass

201
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,357
Catch it if you can

202
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,043
Your name sir?
- l'm what you'd call Raj Kapoor Tiwari

203
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,547
Where's your seat here, show me...

204
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:27,398
l'm not on your list...the other one.
l talked to the ticket checker, paid him

205
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,959
Oh, so you've paid him a bribe

206
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,196
No, no...- Give me your address

207
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:37,102
Why do you need my address ?

208
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,776
Do you see that berth number ?

209
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,309
Take a look.- Number seven

210
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,641
Coach FC1 , berth number 7

211
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,476
Always reserved for...

212
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:51,918
the Fursatganj staff going to Lucknow.
l've been using this berth for 3 years

213
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:59,995
The entire railway division knows that.
How could anyone have given it to you ?

214
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,600
Could you tug that chain for me please ?

215
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:42,568
Trust Finance & Chit Fund Company
Loans, chit funds for every need

216
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:46,937
You think you're the first person
to come up with this idea ?

217
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,238
We spend eight hours a day in offices
like this, chewing tobacco, eh ?

218
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,176
200 out of every 1 00 finance companies
dream of a scheme like this...

219
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,351
but trip over their own two feet...

220
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:59,784
trying to find 500 investors
to chip in a thousand rupees each

221
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,585
The answer to my next question
is on your face but...

222
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:08,229
l'll ask you anyway... Mister, where
are your 500 investors ?

223
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,263
What if l tell you l have them ?

224
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:12,829
Where...?

225
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:14,794
Here

226
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,268
l've slogged it out for a whole year, sir

227
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:24,311
l've gotten together 500 investors from
my town and the neighbouring ones...

228
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,881
willing to put up a thousand rupees
each in any good finance company

229
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,778
Where are you from?

230
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:31,615
Fursatganj

231
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:37,690
Fursatganj ! Where l was once

232
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,260
Not one finance company...

233
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:45,129
will waste five minutes over
a list like this one

234
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,430
Talk of investments

235
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:53,840
Small town-guys have a habit of
dreaming big. No ban on dreaming

236
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:54,512
lndulge yourself

237
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:58,342
But next time,
come up with a scheme that...

238
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:03,749
a thousand others haven't thought up
before you. Get it ? Now excuse me

239
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,166
Where are you going, lady?
- To enter the contest

240
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,635
You can't go in.
- lf l can't go inside...

241
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,241
how do l take part in the competition?
Let me in. l've come really far

242
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:28,777
l said, you can't go in.
- l say, l have to enter

243
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,953
Can l help you ?
- Yes, myself Vimmi Saluja...

244
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,180
l've come to enter the contest.
- You're too late

245
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:42,588
What...?
- The entries closed two days ago

246
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,625
You mean the contest's begun?
- No, not yet

247
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,424
Oh, that's a relief.
- l said, entries have closed

248
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:51,398
But the contest hasn't begun!
- l said ''the-entries-have-closed''

249
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,400
So open up for two minutes,
l'll quickly squeeze in !

250
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:56,472
You're from some village?
Miss Quickly-squeeze-in !

251
00:22:56,675 --> 00:23:00,236
This is no village fair
to squeeze-in-slip-out when-you-wish

252
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:03,676
This is the Miss lndia contest,
but what would you know ?

253
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:05,816
Oh c'mon Pammi, forget it

254
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:10,477
One minute... would l know what ?
- The desire and the ability...

255
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,886
to become Miss lndia are two very
different things. So go home...

256
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:17,653
and start a beauty parlour.
- Why not beauty-parlour yourself ?

257
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:18,488
Excuse me ?

258
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:21,689
Ever watched your figure ?
At least ten kilos overweight...

259
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,494
with black-dyed hair and
desperately-curving-lipline...

260
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:29,504
with miles-thick lipstick. You know all
about make-up. Beauty parlour's for you

261
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,766
What a bitch

262
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:01,001
Listen...

263
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:06,809
Yes?
- Please come with me to the toilet

264
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:12,477
lt's right at the end of the platform
and it's really dark

265
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:18,251
Come

266
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:27,493
Weren't you on the
Jhansi Mail this morning ?

267
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:36,265
Returning? Here on business?
- Yes l came for the Miss lndia contest

268
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:41,970
So how was it ?

269
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,450
Good... very good

270
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:50,444
l got through the first round

271
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,117
Good... good... Miss lndia !

272
00:24:55,861 --> 00:25:00,298
And you ? Here on business too?
- Oh no... no...

273
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,428
Work is something
l don't really believe in

274
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,933
l came here for a meeting

275
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:12,336
There's a finance company here,
they want to buy my scheme

276
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:17,946
l had to come personally you see,
it's a matter of millions

277
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:25,615
So, you're becoming
a model soon?- l guess so

278
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:32,020
You'll become famous.
- Yes... l guess so

279
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:35,359
People will buzz around you
like bees around honey

280
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,826
Yes... l guess they will

281
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:47,373
Why are you crying ?

282
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,046
l didn't mean to insult you

283
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,382
No, don't take me otherwise

284
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:59,284
l belong to a decent family,
l wouldn't dream of it

285
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:03,056
Calm down, everyone's watching

286
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:06,230
Poor thing... she's in grieving

287
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,331
l was only sympathising...

288
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:12,800
Everything's fine

289
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:22,244
You'll be the first girl to cry after
making it to the Miss lndia contest

290
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:32,651
l didn't make it anywhere

291
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,285
Aren't you ashamed of lying ?

292
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:46,996
Actually, l lied too...

293
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,639
the manager of the finance company
didn't quite buy my scheme...

294
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,707
l think he doesn't have the drive

295
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,844
Bloody idiot

296
00:26:56,481 --> 00:27:00,281
Foulmouthing... me...?

297
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,681
Escort her to the loo
and then get abused for it ?

298
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,783
l escorted you !
Who do you think you are ?

299
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:19,000
You mean if you go back now...?
- Wedding bells...

300
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:23,330
That's too bad. - Very

301
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:24,399
Then ?

302
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:36,317
l'll run away.
- You already have

303
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:43,693
So, what'll you do now?
- What'll you do ?

304
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:50,058
Whatever l do, l'm not giving up.
And l'm not going back home

305
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:56,434
Then, where will you go? - Kanpur

306
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:01,143
Why Kanpur?
- The company has a head office there

307
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:05,305
l'll show my scheme to senior officers,
l'm sure they'll get it

308
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:10,383
Why don't you come
along to Kanpur? - Who me...?

309
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:15,650
Miss lndia contests are held all over.
Maybe they'll allow you to enter there

310
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:21,496
You got to find a way into the contest,
else what use was running away ?

311
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:48,924
So long, l guess the next time
l see you it'll be on TV

312
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:55,266
l guess so. Thank you.
And good luck for your big meeting

313
00:28:56,101 --> 00:29:00,663
Thanks but that was superfluous. l only
need to make a presentation and...

314
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,999
voila ! l'll have 1 00 finance companies
running rings around me

315
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,968
See you

316
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:17,379
Unbelievable. Got to admit...
very few people have brains as sharp

317
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:25,962
l say, just once in a whole year,
let me meet just one such person

318
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:35,370
But two in a single day, unbelievable!
Would you believe...

319
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:40,103
just half an hour ago, another man
came to me with an identical scheme

320
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:45,815
Who?
- Manager of our Lucknow branch...

321
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:51,250
Mr Qureishi ! lmagine... a rare gem
lay buried in my own backyard

322
00:29:52,423 --> 00:30:01,092
He got a 1 0,000 bonus on the spot !
He even had a list of 500 investors

323
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:03,832
Unbelievable ! What a man !
- Where's he staying ?

324
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:08,995
Landmark Hotel.
- ln Landmark ! And why not ?

325
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:17,740
The 1 0,000 bonus ! Give me as much
l'll go to live in a five star too

326
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,643
Next?- Vimmi Saluja

327
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,821
Address?
- 2/5 Ballygunj, Pankinagar

328
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:29,854
One minute...

329
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:36,427
Doesn't Pankinagar fall within
the Lucknow district ?

330
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:39,363
lt does?
- Yes, Lucknow district

331
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:46,071
You didn't fill up the form in Lucknow?
- What difference, here or there ?

332
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,837
l was passing through Kanpur
so l thought l'll get it over with

333
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,105
Very good

334
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,810
Please step outside

335
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:59,487
Sir'ji, just a matter of an address...
- Go away ! Rules are rules

336
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,191
Please...- Get lost

337
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,021
Oversmartness

338
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:16,764
Look, l can't bend the rules

339
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:21,138
But if you wish...

340
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:23,511
l can forget rules for a while

341
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:28,780
Yes sir!
- But nothing comes for free

342
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:32,054
Sir, l'll do whatever you wish !

343
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:36,091
Very good!
Once you're Miss lndia...

344
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:42,062
you'll have all the wealth,
all the fame your heart ever desired

345
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:47,804
But l? l'm still stuck to the same
... chair and table

346
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:48,864
Oh sure...

347
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:56,511
l have nothing right now...
but l promise, when l'm Miss lndia...

348
00:31:56,714 --> 00:32:00,377
l'll pay you...
everything you'll ever want

349
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:08,255
You're mistaken. You have everything
l'll ever want... right now

350
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:17,025
l won't force you. Registration closes
in five minutes. Think it over

351
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,902
You'll find me at the same table

352
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:01,845
What's your name?- Jajjan

353
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,240
You make tea?
- No, l serve tea

354
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:15,120
This world we live in boy,
has two kinds of people

355
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:19,687
One, those who serve tea.
And those to whom tea is served

356
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,562
The faster you become one of the latter,
the better the life that you'll live

357
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:25,496
Has somebody hurt you ?

358
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:35,472
Two teas and chips

359
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:37,511
Two?

360
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:41,946
Why ? Problem ?
- No. But who's the second cup for?

361
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,052
lf l drink two cups,
will it start a war?

362
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:49,515
God, this world we live in...!
Get a hold on this kid

363
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,893
lt's no use. - What ?

364
00:33:56,334 --> 00:34:00,668
No use being earnest, unwitting fools
getting shoved in stinking little towns

365
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:04,040
Then...?- Bombay...

366
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,108
the only city in all of lndia where
a man is recognised for his worth...

367
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:15,714
the only place where you can start from
the pavement and end up in palaces...

368
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,889
where ambition isn't pushed around,
but cheered, egging you on

369
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,148
How're you so sure?
- How...

370
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:26,295
if Dhirubhai Ambani, Ratan Tata, Birla
had been in Lucknow-Kanpur...

371
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:28,795
they'd be swatting flies in
Ambani General Stores, Tata Flour Mills

372
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,097
And Birla Tobacco Stall. Bombay...
gave them the recognition they deserved

373
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,634
Look where it got them...

374
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,506
So you want to go Bombay ?

375
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,382
You can come along too.
What'll you do here ?

376
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:51,313
All the top models are in Bombay. Damn
this narrow-minded small-town mob

377
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:55,583
lt's the place for Miss lndia, no?- Yes

378
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:01,621
A ticket to Bombay,
how much would it cost ?

379
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,001
Not that l have that kind of cash

380
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,801
l got the cash, don't worry.
- What...?

381
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:20,016
We've seen where truth has landed us.
Now let's say what they want to hear

382
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:23,979
And what's that...?
- Oi Jajjan, where's Landmark Hotel ?

383
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,153
One whiskey...
- Which one sir ?

384
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,851
lmported. How much for a Black Label?
- Four hundred, sir

385
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,826
For a bottle ?- No. 30 ml

386
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:34,892
Small peg

387
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:40,267
l'll try an lndian whiskey for a change.
And don't forget the peanuts

388
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:47,203
Some pretty suave people
you got walking into this Gazal Bar

389
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:54,383
One Black Label

390
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:55,176
Sir

391
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,181
Sir ! You here ?

392
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:05,256
Fursatganj ! All of Lucknow seems to be
pouring into Kanpur today

393
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:08,955
Slick ! What are you doing here ?
- You'll be seeing more of me here

394
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,063
What do you mean ?
- My scheme got rocking

395
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:16,672
Which... the same one ?
- No... it was unworkable

396
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:20,469
You tipped me off in time.
l could've wasted another good year

397
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,914
This is another scheme.
- Which is this ?

398
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:31,185
l explained this scheme, they offered me
a two per cent stake in the channel

399
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,622
What channel...?
- A news channel

400
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,785
News channel

401
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:43,925
Nowadays this news channel business
is taking off like a rocket

402
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:48,999
ln 3 months, they're giving investors
a 300 per cent return on investment

403
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,937
Cigarette ? - Really ?

404
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:56,078
How much... is the investment ?
- At least 1 00,000

405
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:02,408
Won't they take a little less ?
l mean, l could invest too...?

406
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,884
Why don't you have a chat ?

407
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,785
Give me an introduction

408
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:21,193
This is Mr Qureishi
- Q.Q.Qureishi

409
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:30,411
Q.Q.Qureishi, a very dear friend.
Whatever l am today is because of him

410
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:44,053
Mr Qureishi would like to invest
in the channel

411
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,152
How many millions ?

412
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:51,797
He's not like other investors...
this is just a friendly gesture...

413
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:53,402
about ten thousand ?- Ten

414
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:55,467
Ten...?

415
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:57,667
Fifteen... ?

416
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,803
But you're aware,
it should be at least...

417
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:07,743
Ok, all right,
now how can l refuse you ?

418
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:18,084
One request, this remains between us
... let this be our little secret

419
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:22,096
No, no... !
- Promise

420
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:26,700
We must be in Delhi by morning

421
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,072
So you take the cash from him...

422
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:33,742
and fetch us a receipt from my room

423
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:39,039
ln the meantime, if he has no objections
Mr Qureishi can give me company

424
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:40,908
Yes ?

425
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,750
Well ?- No... l mean no problem

426
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:52,853
Ten ?

427
00:38:58,035 --> 00:38:59,832
Fursatganj, don't forget the receipt

428
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:14,684
Would you like to
dance with me Mr Q.Q.Qureishi ?

429
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:26,222
You dance really well.- Thank you

430
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,666
Where's the ladies' room ?
- Thank you

431
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:37,102
The washroom... where is it ?
- Bartender, where's the washroom ?

432
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,119
Run

433
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,998
What d'you think of my acting ?
Better than yours ?

434
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,405
Who conned him to your table ?
- Who made the sucker dance ?

435
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:20,646
l'd love to see Q.Q.Qureishi dancing

436
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:26,956
Hey, the cash

437
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:28,419
Some sample

438
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,860
Your share. - You keep it

439
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:37,160
lt's your share.- Not a gift

440
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:40,768
Just bank it for me till Bombay.
l can't manage money

441
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,100
We had fun though, no ?

442
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:49,942
Lots...

443
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:07,821
Move it. Sit in the bus

444
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:13,561
Passengers for Dehradun and Ambala,
your bus is leaving

445
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:17,599
Name ?- Bunty

446
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,406
And the Mrs ?

447
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:22,436
Babli

448
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:27,241
Bunty... Babli... seats 2 1 and 22

449
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:29,116
Get inside

450
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:38,955
Bunty... Babli... what the hell...?
- Nothing... move on. 2 1 and 22

451
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:44,299
What do you mean nothing?
- Sit down, l'll explain

452
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:50,005
When l was a kid l always blamed
Bunty for all the mischief l did

453
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:53,835
And we've just stolen money. So...
- But... what the hell is Babli ?

454
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,973
Why, what's wrong ?
l don't have a problem with Bunty

455
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:01,082
You look like your Bunty !
But Babli... she sounds like a fat slob

456
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:06,656
Fat or thin, now it's sealed.
- You could've asked me

457
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,559
Ask my wife her name
in front of a bus conductor ?

458
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,459
Who are you calling your wife ?
- l didn't say that, he thought so

459
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:20,297
And you let it pass ! Now everyone
in this bus thinks l'm Bunty's wife

460
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:27,877
What are you doing ? Everyone will
think Bunty's wife is a shrew

461
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,872
Stop it !
- You stop it

462
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,309
l'm not talking.- Suits me

463
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:35,348
Babli, big deal

464
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:02,735
At least we managed enough
to get us to Bombay

465
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:08,744
This stash won't last us
a week in Bombay

466
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,450
And...?

467
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:19,421
And... l think we'll need lots more
if we want to make it in Bombay

468
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:23,562
Where will we get so much money ?
- The same place we got this from

469
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,123
You mean another... ?

470
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:32,606
Are you mad ? What are you saying ?
- l'm not saying a thing. Bunty is

471
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:39,909
And l'm doing what Bunty's saying ?
- Who are you to do ? Babli will

472
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:41,710
Babli ?

473
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:47,957
But l am Babli ! - Sure

474
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:52,492
You are when you are

475
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:54,893
You aren't when you aren't

476
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,562
Say, what are you now...?

477
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:02,834
Bunty. You...?

478
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:06,600
Babli...?

479
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:12,638
TmG

480
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:21,120
Babli Bose, Food lnspector.
l'll inspect your kitchen

481
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:26,763
We hear, the beer is adulterated here.
- Tony, a chilled beer for the sahib

482
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:30,161
One step, two step, he steps it up
swings it, pumps it, struts his stuff

483
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:31,231
Meet Bunty

484
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:37,505
Minute by minute, she turns it up
spins it so you can't get enough

485
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:38,640
Meet Babli

486
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:48,309
Spinning like tops,
orchestrating rip-offs...

487
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:53,184
they'll clean your pockets,
cock a snook and be off

488
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:59,060
There ain't a legit soul
from who they never stole

489
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:07,170
When they dig, they dig so deep
you can't get out of that hole

490
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:11,933
Bunty Saluja, Tourism department.
Unclean rooms. Got to inspect

491
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:15,339
Unclean ? How many days of inspection ?
- Three

492
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:26,055
Bunty And Babli

493
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:27,450
They maybe two...

494
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:31,094
but they're too much

495
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:41,834
Tough-2-catch, too fast-2-touch

496
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:49,701
Consider it your's

497
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,813
Take it away...

498
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:55,348
fly away, she's yours

499
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:05,093
What model number is this ?
- Model number can take a hike !

500
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:08,423
Why isn't your man back yet ?
- What man ?

501
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:15,162
Man... means husband.
- Husband ! What crap. You bloody fool

502
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:23,947
Love is wild like pigeon wings

503
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:31,612
Tantrums trip on diamond rings

504
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,454
Don't you blink

505
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:37,786
You might see their shadows pass

506
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:41,624
Tea cups clink. Tea cups crash.
Forgive, forget, they have a fight...

507
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,926
wipe their mouths
and take full flight...

508
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:50,732
come, come, come on, come on,
one step, two step, swing it Bunty

509
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:25,402
Bulandshahr is abuzz with
the amusing misadventures...

510
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:29,170
of this daring duo
who call themselves Bunty and Babli

511
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:34,578
People seem to be in awe
of their ingenuity and audacity

512
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:46,627
Would you like a room or a suite ?

513
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:51,826
No, l don't want just a room

514
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:57,469
l want the hotel...
we're here to buy this place

515
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:01,610
l never thought l'd sell this place.
But your strong background...

516
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:05,873
and this mind blowing offer...
l'd have to be a lunatic to refuse

517
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,077
How long are you here ?

518
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:12,186
A week maybe...
- Stay here then... as our guests

519
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:17,950
This hotel's as good as yours.
We'll discuss details over the weekend

520
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:23,222
No, doesn't look good. We can't stay
before we've signed the dotted line

521
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:25,799
l won't take no for an answer

522
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:31,640
Well if you insist... champagne ?

523
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:15,174
Searched every inch of Mussoorie sir,
l can't find them

524
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:19,549
What do you mean ? And their stuff ?
- They even stole ours

525
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:23,055
Damn them

526
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:31,298
Come away, come away

527
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:38,407
All our sparkles fly
right across the sky

528
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:45,571
Then we sight the morning light
Float up high

529
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,578
Witness the magic of Guru'ji

530
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:53,122
People running after you like this
... it's a heady feeling

531
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,518
What...?
- Makes me feels like l'm an achiever

532
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:08,598
They walk wrapped in perfume mists

533
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:17,607
Hold the world in love-locked fists

534
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:23,150
You won't see them flit about
till they want you to, and when you do...

535
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,948
he slides with a swagger.
- He's Bunty

536
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:30,456
She glides zig-zagger.
- She's Babli

537
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:34,687
Their tales are lore...
been told a score times and more

538
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:46,571
And will be sung forever more

539
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:50,736
l can't see any tunnel here...
- We've paid a hundred bucks apiece

540
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:53,245
Where's that Bunty guide ?

541
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:57,352
Spinning like tops,
orchestrating rip-offs...

542
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:02,651
they'll clean your pockets,
cock a snook and be off...

543
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:08,088
there ain't a legit soul
from who they never stole...

544
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:11,699
and they dig so deep
you can't get out that hole

545
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,563
One step, two step

546
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,237
Swings it, pumps it, struts his stuff

547
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:16,531
Oye Bunty

548
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:26,111
She turns it on, spins it
so you can't get enough. Oye Babli

549
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:29,716
Bunty Aur Babli
Bunty and Babli

550
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,186
They maybe two but they're too much
Tough-2-catch, too fast-2-touch

551
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,085
l'm so hungry l can't think straight

552
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:13,562
And you will shut up and eat
whatever's available. No tantrums

553
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:16,521
Makes you cry ?

554
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:22,797
What's to cry about ?
- None of your business

555
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:30,640
Look, what l meant was
you can't get pizzas out here

556
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,848
All right, l'll get whatever
you feel like

557
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:41,617
Tell me what you want

558
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:48,963
Who...?
- l want my mummy

559
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:55,532
But...

560
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:57,963
out here...?

561
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:00,641
l miss her

562
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:07,981
You miss her a lot ?

563
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:12,913
Go on, get it over with

564
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:45,813
Over ?

565
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:53,788
Not over ! l'm missing her,
not laying an egg ! Over !

566
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:03,832
What do you miss ?

567
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,303
When l was little...

568
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:13,675
Papa'ji would talk about taking us
for a holiday, far away from Pankinagar

569
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:20,513
But in all my years of waiting,
we never saved up enough for a holiday

570
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:26,453
You want to send some money home ?

571
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:32,260
Do you want to call them ?

572
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:38,132
Come...

573
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,949
No one's saying anything

574
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:02,697
Then why are you wasting your breath ?
- l don't know why... l think it's Vimmi

575
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:09,930
Who's this ?

576
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:13,107
Some nut

577
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:14,669
Papa'ji

578
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:17,270
lt's me... Papa'ji

579
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:22,012
Vimmi, my child...
where did you disappear ?

580
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:26,985
l'm okay Papa, l'm fine

581
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:29,522
Vimmi my child, where are you ?

582
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:34,362
l can't tell Mummy, but l'm fine

583
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:36,624
Look dear...

584
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:43,768
No Papa'ji, don't ask me to come back
now... l don't want to come back

585
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:49,176
But l really love both of you

586
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:55,340
No, my child, listen to me...
- No Papa'ji. l'm hanging up now

587
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:56,143
Bye...

588
00:55:56,386 --> 00:56:02,291
l love you both very much

589
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:18,136
You want to call home too ?

590
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:20,838
No

591
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:25,980
Folks at home
must be worried about you too

592
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:37,453
No one worries about me

593
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,061
What are you doing here ?

594
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:57,076
Wondering where he's now
... how he's doing

595
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:08,182
Do you think l was too harsh on him ?
- You were right in whatever you did

596
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:11,351
Have your tea, it's time to go to work

597
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:34,707
Enough ? Satisfied ?

598
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:38,786
lf you manage money like this in Bombay
in no time, you'll be back...

599
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:43,049
in your punk-whatever-town.
- Pankinagar, you bloody idiot

600
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:46,387
Wherever, but you're finished.
- What's left to count ?

601
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:51,396
You've blown it all up.
- l have, have l...?

602
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:57,401
Expensive dresses, shoploads of
makeup just fell out of the sky ?

603
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:01,069
They came from the same place as
your watch, designer shirt, jeans...

604
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:04,474
and... this deodorant that smells like
turnip pickle gone bad

605
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:06,114
They fell off the sky, they did

606
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:09,978
Now what ?

607
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,120
l've been thinking...

608
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:23,031
Let's... do it one more time ?
- No...

609
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:31,330
we've pooled enough to get us to
Bombay.- Vimmi this world we live in...

610
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:35,811
has two kinds of people. One...
those who collect enough and those...

611
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:42,042
who'll never have enough. Myself and
Tata-Birla-Ambanis are the other kind

612
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:48,790
That's why they're where they are today.
And once we're in Bombay...

613
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:56,831
we won't get another chance. So...
let's take one last crack. Just once more

614
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:00,464
You think so ?

615
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:03,105
l know so. So l say so

616
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:06,331
Who says so ? You or Bunty ?
- Bunty's always saying so

617
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:15,150
Today a little of me is with Bunty.
- Oye Rakesh... my sweet bloody idiot

618
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,240
This one.
- No problem

619
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:42,972
There's just one problem

620
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:46,740
Just tell me.
- l'm leaving for Mussoorie tonight

621
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:49,282
Oh, that is a beautiful place
- l know

622
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:52,548
Tomorrow l have an inauguration.
- Your inauguration ?

623
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,321
Not mine... my hotel's

624
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,580
Oh, l see

625
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:58,125
Look Mrs...- Miss...

626
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:04,831
Miss... earliest we can deliver
would be by tomorrow morning

627
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:12,432
lt's closing time, you see ?
And we can't stay open for one machine

628
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:15,911
No, no... not one machine.
- Then ?

629
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:18,876
All.- All...?

630
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:26,821
But if the mall isn't open...
- No... l'll open up myself... l mean...

631
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:28,422
l'll open it up myself for you

632
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,289
Lovely

633
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:36,065
Sixty thousand

634
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:42,836
You take cash don't you ?
- l take anything you say

635
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:03,017
Let's shop

636
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:10,754
Easy brother, easy. The stuff inside
is real precious

637
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:21,209
Sorry for troubling you so much.
- You can trouble me as much as you wish

638
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:25,013
Please visit our hotel sometime.
- Sure

639
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:28,112
Your machines are now yours

640
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:32,512
Here's the balance amount

641
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:36,457
Thank you very much
- Mention not

642
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,957
May God send customers like you
my way every day

643
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:45,632
l pray we come by
shops like yours everyday

644
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:53,008
l have the same...

645
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:58,537
We seem to share similar tastes.
- l wish we find more in common

646
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:15,220
Mehmood ! Let her rip.
- You sound like he's after us already

647
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:19,192
lf he isn't, then he soon will

648
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:23,269
Oye Bunty, you gave him a licking ?

649
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:46,123
300,000 worth of shades

650
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:49,790
400,000 in watches

651
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:53,993
700,000 in electronic items

652
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:55,067
Deal

653
01:02:58,441 --> 01:02:59,567
Time for a Chinese lunch. Come

654
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:04,908
l can't count any more

655
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:09,542
The incredible incident at the
renowned Center One Mall in Bareilly...

656
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:16,385
has confounded the police. Sources say,
the perpetrators of this heist are...

657
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:22,553
Bunty and Babli whose capers have
already made headlines in many cities

658
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:29,193
Even as investigations proceed, by now
Bunty and Babli must be far far away

659
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:32,833
Tomorrow morning ! Bombay.
- That soon ?

660
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:37,240
Before you've brushed your teeth.
This train gets there like a bullet

661
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:40,946
Good. We can get to work
the minute we get there

662
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:48,289
You're hunting for the top models ?
- Like you're catching your Tata-Birlas

663
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:52,552
Your share

664
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:57,227
Always splitting cash
at the drop of a hat ? What's with you ?

665
01:03:57,466 --> 01:04:00,765
Let's just get it over with, no ?
So tomorrow...

666
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:03,029
you get on with your life,
l'll get on with mine

667
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:07,742
What'll you do without me ?
l mean, on your own... in Bombay ?

668
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:09,840
Hog the whole bathroom ?

669
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:17,845
You'll have complete freedom too, no ?
Nobody will be getting on your nerves

670
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:24,123
Well you didn't bug me that much.
- Really now ?

671
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:28,128
The way you fought, l would have to be
the meanest man in the world

672
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:32,859
l can't believe, by tomorrow morning
l'll be in Bombay

673
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:37,228
All these dreams, all these years...
is everything finally coming true ?

674
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:44,743
Flap your wings, come on let's fly

675
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:53,253
Flap your wings, let's taste the sky

676
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:58,783
TmG

677
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,839
Balle-Balle on a Sundae-Sunday

678
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:36,289
Flap your wings, come on let's fly.
Flap your wings, let's taste the sky

679
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:49,507
Let's set the streets of Juliet on fire.
Dance with Romeo in the streets of desire

680
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:53,341
We explode with the light

681
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:55,744
Burn the dance floor, girl

682
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,476
Nach Baliye
Dance the Balle

683
01:05:57,687 --> 01:06:00,850
Want bangles on your wrist, love ?
- Nach Baliye

684
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:04,254
Want jewels in your hair, love ?
- Nach Baliye

685
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:09,159
Run anklets around your feet, love ?
- Nach Baliye

686
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:14,532
Give me bangles on my wrist, love

687
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:18,002
Weave jewels into my hair, love

688
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:23,736
Run anklets around my feet, love

689
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:31,651
Love to watch you baby,
turn around

690
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:46,566
The red carpet of dreams
unfurls for us to walk on

691
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:50,034
Fate's now a little toy,
to toss, to roll, to rock on

692
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:56,735
Take your bets now, gamble your life.
Fate's at my feet. Ready to ride ?

693
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:58,971
Then come...

694
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,307
take my hand, love...

695
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:03,815
l'll give you the ride of your life

696
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:07,251
Then take my hand, love...

697
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:10,425
give me the ride of my life

698
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:17,088
Let's set the streets of Juliet on fire,
dance with Romeo in the streets of desire

699
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:21,099
We explode with the light

700
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:23,669
Burn the dance floor, girl

701
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,602
Dance the Balle

702
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:58,969
Clap your hands everybody,
everybody just clap your hands

703
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:22,826
Day doesn't sink into night here

704
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:26,330
These roads stay awake, alight here

705
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:33,168
Tip-toeing upon my eyelids are dreams
that never sleep

706
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:36,776
Then take my hand, love...

707
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:40,312
l'll give you the ride of your life

708
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:26,883
Attention

709
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:34,159
Train from Delhi to Bombay is arriving
on platform 36 instead of platform 1 2

710
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:50,507
Bunty-Babli's largesse for the poor
Con duo named in several heists

711
01:11:00,522 --> 01:11:01,648
Bombay's really crowded, no ?

712
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:04,385
Everyone's here to make
their dreams come true, no ?

713
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,987
What's this stench ?
Must be fish, no...?

714
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:08,930
Where do you think
fashion shows happen here ?

715
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:12,890
Let's get you into a taxi
- And... you ?

716
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:17,666
l'm going back.
- What !

717
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:24,174
Look, l don't want to stay in Bombay.
- What do you mean ?

718
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:35,050
l just... wanted to be really famous...
a name to be reckoned with...

719
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:37,591
a name in the headlines

720
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:48,359
Vimmi, for the first time in my life
l think l have a talent no one else has

721
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:59,143
l realise now, l never was Rakesh.
l've always been Bunty...

722
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:01,705
l've always enjoyed being him

723
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:10,147
To tell you the truth, l never had
the perseverance it takes...

724
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,819
to become a Tata or Ambani,
nor the calibre

725
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:21,259
Anyway, doesn't matter now.
l think l've discovered my destination

726
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:23,168
And l'm on my way towards it

727
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:27,334
Look...

728
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:34,240
this is what l want to do...

729
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:39,149
all my life, freely

730
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:42,288
But you please become a model,
a supermodel...

731
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:43,185
so take care

732
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:53,492
All this... you did it all alone ?

733
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:57,633
That's not what l meant. - Then...?

734
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:02,202
Without you...
- You can't walk one step, you know ?

735
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:07,548
Wants himself in headlines !
Who wants to read about you ?

736
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:12,114
No one's interested in reading
or publishing a Bunty-minus-Babli

737
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:19,350
Truth is... without me, you could've
done nothing and you never will

738
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:23,993
Your taxi...

739
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:26,258
Tell me... can you ?

740
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:27,827
Yes

741
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:32,899
No

742
01:13:33,308 --> 01:13:34,570
Can you live without me ?

743
01:13:35,677 --> 01:13:36,336
Yes

744
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:44,478
Then why are you screaming taxi-taxi ?
- Because you need to go

745
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,817
Yes...
- So tell me... where ?

746
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:49,045
Where you want to go

747
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:03,133
Who says so ?

748
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:06,937
You or Babli ?

749
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:09,811
What do you think ?

750
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:12,803
Must be you

751
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:16,383
So will you do something about it ?

752
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:22,590
lf that's the case then
l must do something about it, no ?

753
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:28,121
What the hell !
l didn't mean that

754
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:33,293
Wasn't me. lt was Bunty.
- Everyone's staring

755
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:40,640
We're in Bombay.
No one looks at anyone here

756
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:46,310
Think it over

757
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:51,747
l won't let you rule over the bathroom.
- Done

758
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:55,554
No more sleeping alone on the floor.
- Sounds good

759
01:14:55,891 --> 01:15:00,089
What about all the modelling dreams ?
- That's Vimmi's problem

760
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:05,687
But you...?

761
01:15:05,722 --> 01:15:07,296
- l've become Babli

762
01:15:07,896 --> 01:15:08,521
Forever

763
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:32,884
You know what it's worth ?
Not five paise. lt's a fake

764
01:15:49,537 --> 01:15:51,971
Who...?
- What...?

765
01:15:52,607 --> 01:15:53,505
What's your name?

766
01:15:55,076 --> 01:15:55,735
Mehmood

767
01:15:57,312 --> 01:15:58,074
You're a comedian ?

768
01:16:01,783 --> 01:16:06,379
Let's start by making you laugh ?
Okay, two jokes for you

769
01:16:07,822 --> 01:16:08,413
One

770
01:16:09,991 --> 01:16:12,391
Mrs and Mr Flea come out
after a matinee show

771
01:16:13,294 --> 01:16:15,023
Mrs Flea says,
l'm tired today

772
01:16:15,964 --> 01:16:17,795
Mr Flea says,
honey don't worry, l'll hail us a dog

773
01:16:30,778 --> 01:16:35,681
You are that dog...
the one they rode for the hike

774
01:16:37,018 --> 01:16:38,542
Now spill it, did you go
to Center One that night or no ?

775
01:16:40,555 --> 01:16:41,146
No sir

776
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:47,150
This here, is my second joke

777
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,143
Where are those two now ?

778
01:16:54,202 --> 01:16:56,796
Long time... gone

779
01:16:59,040 --> 01:16:59,938
Names...?

780
01:17:00,675 --> 01:17:03,143
Bunty y Babli

781
01:17:08,683 --> 01:17:09,513
How old are they ?

782
01:17:10,051 --> 01:17:12,849
Bunty's around 23-24

783
01:17:14,622 --> 01:17:15,782
Babli is 20-21

784
01:17:16,290 --> 01:17:21,694
She was really sweet, well mannered
and intelligent, sir

785
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:25,623
Even the boy was all heart, great guy

786
01:17:26,134 --> 01:17:26,930
That's quite something, sir

787
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:28,902
No, you asses are quite something

788
01:17:30,905 --> 01:17:32,998
To think that petty criminals...

789
01:17:33,207 --> 01:17:39,339
booked for cheating, misdemeanour,
malfeasance, fraud and perjury...

790
01:17:39,547 --> 01:17:41,071
are quite something

791
01:17:42,383 --> 01:17:45,648
And not just you, the whole lot of you
from this generation is quite something

792
01:17:47,555 --> 01:17:52,458
Right and wrong, good esteem and bad,
good deeds and bad...

793
01:17:52,727 --> 01:17:54,092
you've forgotten what sets them apart

794
01:17:59,667 --> 01:18:04,798
But l can tell the difference.
And l'm going to teach you fools too

795
01:18:06,307 --> 01:18:09,708
The newspapers say that for
boys and girls in schools and colleges...

796
01:18:09,911 --> 01:18:14,939
these two crooks are role models.
- So they want to be role models ?

797
01:18:17,251 --> 01:18:17,876
Fine...

798
01:18:20,388 --> 01:18:22,379
then that's what they'll become...

799
01:18:24,625 --> 01:18:31,394
l'll make them a fine example
of a cure for this generation

800
01:18:35,103 --> 01:18:37,833
What did you say their names were ?
- Bunty and Babli

801
01:18:39,774 --> 01:18:42,757
This Bunty-Babli better watch out for me

802
01:19:01,229 --> 01:19:03,356
We'll never ever cheat on each other

803
01:19:04,699 --> 01:19:08,100
We'll always place each other
before ourselves

804
01:19:08,903 --> 01:19:09,460
OK

805
01:19:10,271 --> 01:19:12,296
We'll never ever break
each other's hearts

806
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:17,803
And if we do so accidentally, we won't
burst into tears without warning

807
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:24,011
Okay, we will never eat or drink
anything without each other

808
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,285
Except early morning tea

809
01:19:28,189 --> 01:19:29,952
You wake up like a queen at noon
l can't wait that long

810
01:19:32,293 --> 01:19:34,420
We'll give each other
the same amount of love forever

811
01:19:34,629 --> 01:19:38,395
Why ? We can give more !
l'll love you even more tomorrow...

812
01:19:38,633 --> 01:19:42,125
more the day after and so much more
the day after the day after

813
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:47,734
We'll cut off all ties
with those who don't understand us

814
01:19:47,942 --> 01:19:51,469
Except our parents.
- Your parents

815
01:19:55,616 --> 01:19:57,413
We'll be Bunty-Babli
for the rest of our lives

816
01:19:57,618 --> 01:20:01,384
And we'll live out all our dreams.
- Except...

817
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:05,453
Except...?
- Leave that to me

818
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:06,885
okej

819
01:20:08,162 --> 01:20:12,895
Now the groom may kiss the bride !
- Oye Rakesh just married !

820
01:20:32,053 --> 01:20:32,678
Look...

821
01:20:34,222 --> 01:20:38,989
right at the outset of this marriage
l want to tell you all about my past

822
01:20:40,194 --> 01:20:42,958
l don't want any issues later

823
01:20:45,032 --> 01:20:54,703
ln school, when l was in Class Two,
Mukesh used to sit behind me

824
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:58,911
He used to tug at my plaits

825
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:08,679
And you know...
it used to make me giggle like crazy

826
01:21:10,157 --> 01:21:11,852
These boys are all scoundrels

827
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:17,721
They'll try their luck
with every cute girl

828
01:21:19,734 --> 01:21:20,723
How true

829
01:21:22,403 --> 01:21:28,000
How lucky l am,
you aren't like those boys

830
01:21:28,909 --> 01:21:32,845
Rakesh... you're such a good boy

831
01:21:33,047 --> 01:21:34,537
Sweet boy

832
01:21:38,686 --> 01:21:48,027
So... what l was saying was...
now that you are my wife...

833
01:21:50,431 --> 01:21:53,923
my mate in joy and sorrow...

834
01:21:56,537 --> 01:21:57,629
for all my days to come...

835
01:22:00,007 --> 01:22:04,410
and nights... understand ?

836
01:22:15,089 --> 01:22:16,647
Asleep ? On your wedding night !

837
01:22:28,703 --> 01:22:32,139
This world we live in
has two kinds of people...

838
01:22:34,208 --> 01:22:40,078
those who aren't married
and those who are

839
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:43,007
So...?

840
01:22:44,852 --> 01:22:46,513
So you belong to the latter, no ?

841
01:22:48,689 --> 01:22:49,383
So?

842
01:22:51,459 --> 01:22:52,619
So marry me now you fool

843
01:23:31,065 --> 01:23:35,365
TMG

844
01:23:38,973 --> 01:23:43,967
The clouds have torn

845
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:14,531
My sky has flown

846
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:30,246
l see my skies breaking free
of the earth at the horizon...

847
01:24:30,724 --> 01:24:37,857
soft, slow, on tip-toe
bit by thieving bit...

848
01:24:38,065 --> 01:24:45,699
soft, slow, tip-toeing my love

849
01:24:45,906 --> 01:24:53,836
Do you see what l see...
the earth flows like a river...

850
01:24:54,048 --> 01:25:01,580
earth in water, water in earth
dissolve and begin to shiver

851
01:25:50,871 --> 01:25:58,505
Then my sky breaks free
of the earth at the horizon

852
01:25:58,712 --> 01:26:06,312
No consciousness of what l am
l have no sense of what l'll be

853
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:14,256
This time now seems unreal
This can't be happening to me

854
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:22,698
You slowly dissolve in me
l slowly fade into you

855
01:26:24,438 --> 01:26:32,038
Our feet stop, pick up a dream
Our paths shift, it's coming true

856
01:26:32,246 --> 01:26:39,880
The sky turns over lazily
on it's cloud bed

857
01:26:40,087 --> 01:26:47,892
lt just might melt,
rain down to kiss the ground

858
01:26:48,095 --> 01:26:55,900
The earth dips its toe tips
in a water well

859
01:26:56,537 --> 01:27:03,101
lt just might find feet
roll up, start walking around...

860
01:27:04,311 --> 01:27:11,080
soft, slow, on tip-toe
bit by thieving bit...

861
01:27:47,154 --> 01:27:54,617
Say the word and l stop.
Say the other and l move

862
01:27:54,828 --> 01:28:02,792
lf this is madness that consumes me,
let it be a madness too

863
01:28:03,003 --> 01:28:10,409
Say the word and l stop.
Say the other and l move

864
01:28:10,611 --> 01:28:19,076
A stranger to my destinations
l go where you want me to

865
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:59,353
Soft, bit by thieving bit

866
01:29:00,461 --> 01:29:07,367
Softly, my love

867
01:29:28,188 --> 01:29:34,923
Babli is Bunty's and Bunty is Babli's
Each other's forever they'll be

868
01:29:36,063 --> 01:29:40,466
Babli is Bunty's and Bunty is Babli's
Each other's forever they'll be

869
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:45,070
Each other's forever...
- They'll be

870
01:29:49,843 --> 01:29:53,643
They began their lives...

871
01:29:54,882 --> 01:29:59,478
in small sleepy towns,
towns they detested

872
01:30:00,487 --> 01:30:05,618
Not for poverty, need or misfortune.
Only for fun

873
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,989
Turning to crime for fun?
l'd never ever heard that before

874
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:13,957
News of Bunty-Babli's capers
poured in from all quarters...

875
01:30:14,201 --> 01:30:17,830
dripping into my ears
like red hot molten iron

876
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:22,008
Girls and boys in schools and colleges
began to idolize them as new age heroes

877
01:30:25,712 --> 01:30:28,681
Constantly breathing down their necks,
l even started to think like them...

878
01:30:29,383 --> 01:30:33,683
what next, their next sharp turn...?
My hunches were hitting bull's eye...

879
01:30:34,888 --> 01:30:39,018
and l was inching closer to them
with every passing day

880
01:30:40,561 --> 01:30:45,362
They took their infamy for success
and quickly jumped from cons to scams

881
01:30:45,599 --> 01:30:49,365
Scams no one had ever heard of
or imagined before

882
01:30:53,907 --> 01:30:56,535
Okay, how about Kerala ?
- Too hot

883
01:30:57,277 --> 01:30:59,541
Manali ?
- No, it is too cold

884
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:02,874
Jaipur ?
- lt's too dusty

885
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:05,711
Ladakh ?
- lt's too lonely, Harry

886
01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:10,215
How many times am l gonna tell you,
it's a damn historical monument...

887
01:31:10,424 --> 01:31:13,222
not a hotel which l can rent

888
01:31:13,427 --> 01:31:16,225
That's your problem Harry,
you said if we came to lndia...

889
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:19,058
l could get married wherever l want.
This is what l want

890
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:22,400
You are impossible

891
01:31:22,603 --> 01:31:24,571
Am l... l am ?
- Yes

892
01:31:24,938 --> 01:31:27,168
Really ? Fine !
- Yes

893
01:31:40,954 --> 01:31:44,082
Do you see what l see?
- l'm not blind

894
01:31:44,291 --> 01:31:47,419
Do you hear what l hear ?
- l'm not deaf

895
01:31:47,628 --> 01:31:53,260
Are you thinking what l'm thinking ?
- l'm no mind reader. Get to the point

896
01:31:57,471 --> 01:32:02,272
Protesters... thirty. Taxi drivers...?
- Four

897
01:32:02,476 --> 01:32:05,934
School children ?
- Twenty. With one teacher

898
01:32:07,581 --> 01:32:09,606
Newspaper ?
- Agra Times

899
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:13,619
Minister's office.
- Very good !

900
01:32:14,655 --> 01:32:19,115
And a wedding bash.
- Oye Rakesh ! A first round knockout

901
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:26,299
l want to marry there Harry,
not put it in my living room

902
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:28,468
l told you it's not possible Kate

903
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:34,470
Selling Taj...
- Never, never

904
01:32:34,675 --> 01:32:36,302
Government don't be...
- Clever clever

905
01:32:38,011 --> 01:32:43,813
My car... Mercedes... Mercedes...
- Mercedes stuck in traffic jam

906
01:32:44,685 --> 01:32:47,483
Students protesting Taj sale.
- What sale ?

907
01:32:47,721 --> 01:32:50,315
The Taj is on sale.
Sir this is my Mercedes. Please sit

908
01:32:51,858 --> 01:33:04,498
Please sir... the government is selling
the Taj. We won't let them sell it

909
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:09,835
Extremely sorry sir, l apologise

910
01:33:10,410 --> 01:33:11,502

By him, sir

915
01:33:34,735 --> 01:33:35,702
Excuse me

916
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:40,035
Hold on

917
01:33:47,748 --> 01:33:53,550
No sir, it is not possible.
We cannot sell Taj Mahal to a foreigner

918
01:33:54,588 --> 01:34:00,049
Even if the price is high ?
- No price is too high for Taj Mahal

919
01:34:01,261 --> 01:34:03,388
How about 100 million dollars?
- No sir

920
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:05,898

926
01:34:38,465 --> 01:34:40,262
Who is Phoolsakhi-ji?

01:34:40,467 --> 01:34:47,100
Minister in charge of
purchase and selling of the Taj Mahal

928
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:57,775
Where's the typist ?

929
01:34:57,984 --> 01:35:00,282
She's down with viral fever.
We're getting another typist

930

Get her quickly.
- l'll be in the office all day today

01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:07,285
Of course.
- The typist is here madam'ji

933
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:11,888
Sit !

934
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:20,628
My niece's doctoral thesis.

Of course, it's me. Go on

Sir...

942

You brought the other money ?

943
01:36:32,812 --> 01:36:36,373
l can't believe ! Someone is actually
selling the Taj Mahal

944
01:36:39,252 --> 01:36:42,380
Nor can l believe !
Someone is actually buying

945
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:45,387
This ass is going to get kicked

946
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:47,389
Crowshit on your egghead

947
01:36:54,601 --> 01:36:55,727
He'll be crying for help in two days

How are you madam ?

950
01:37:24,631 --> 01:37:26,758
Would you believe
l've been dying to see you ?

951
01:37:29,002 --> 01:37:31,937
Madam, this is Mr Harry Epstein

952
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:34,105
He wants to buy the Taj Mahal

953
01:37:34,307 --> 01:37:34,932
Exactly

954
01:37:36,977 --> 01:37:37,944
l'm not selling

955
01:37:39,479 --> 01:37:42,778
But madam, we had a deal...
- Why are you late ?

956
01:37:43,316 --> 01:37:43,941
But ma'am...

957
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:44,775
Shut up !

958
01:37:45,485 --> 01:37:47,783
So you can't sell the Taj Mahal to me ?

959
01:37:50,323 --> 01:37:51,790
lt's all a big mistake

960
01:37:52,993 --> 01:37:54,961
And you have wasted my time

961
01:37:56,896 --> 01:37:57,794
One minute

962
01:38:01,835 --> 01:38:08,468
l said l can't sell the Taj Mahal
but it doesn't mean you can't have it

963
01:38:09,175 --> 01:38:10,301
l don't understand

964
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:16,342
You can lease it on rent

965
01:38:19,686 --> 01:38:20,311
For how long ?

966
01:38:21,521 --> 01:38:22,818
Five years

Why are you protesting ?
- Because we have grievances

What grievances ?
- Meet our demands or else

973
01:38:54,387 --> 01:38:55,046

01:38:56,556 --> 01:38:58,683
The revolution...

Quit lndia...?

Goodbye

993
01:40:09,963 --> 01:40:12,090
What happened to this elevator ?
- Could be stuck somewhere

01:40:15,034 --> 01:40:20,301
lt's coming.
- Let's go

995
01:40:31,151 --> 01:40:34,450

He says he owns the Taj Mahal !

1001
01:41:26,873 --> 01:41:29,171
Poor thing,
God can really be cruel sometimes

1002
01:41:29,909 --> 01:41:34,846
Open the gate before l fire you

1003
01:41:35,048 --> 01:41:37,676
Dismiss ?
He says he'll get us dismissed

Doctor ? You need one ?
We call doctor ?

1005
01:41:41,387 --> 01:41:44,515
No doctor ! You talk to Mr Bunty

1006
01:41:45,558 --> 01:41:47,025
He wants some Bunty fellow

1007
01:41:48,061 --> 01:41:50,359
What Bunty...? Hey wait a minute
are they Bunty and Babli ?

1008
01:42:24,898 --> 01:42:26,092
So finally you arrive !

1009
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:29,728
They sold the Taj and scooted while
you stood by and watched it happen ?

1010
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:33,898
Tomorrow when you sell it again
l'll still be left watching

1011
01:42:34,107 --> 01:42:36,234
What !
- Look madam...

1012
01:42:38,444 --> 01:42:41,242
a bull doesn't budge
until he sees red in his face...

1013
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:43,244
and it takes a scam to prod me into
action. l just got the news, no ?

1014
01:42:43,449 --> 01:42:46,077
That's no way to talk.
- Really ? And how did they talk ?

1015
01:42:46,619 --> 01:42:51,249
Go on, file your report about
descriptions, characteristics

1016
01:42:52,458 --> 01:42:53,925
Stop staring at me and do it

1017
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:03,432
No one could've pulled off this caper
without the help of insiders

1018
01:43:03,636 --> 01:43:05,763
Who could it be ?
- Could've been you, madam

1019
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:08,767
You left her alone in the room
at a perfect time

1020
01:43:09,976 --> 01:43:17,940
Corruption happens at the top floor.
But one has to climb from the ground floor

1021
01:43:20,987 --> 01:43:28,450
There's a saying amongst us policemen.
Orderlies make more under the table

1022
01:43:32,999 --> 01:43:33,624
See son...

1023
01:43:35,501 --> 01:43:41,963
you shouldn't have gone to the wedding,
that too in a new car. Getting it ?

1024
01:43:51,250 --> 01:43:51,978
Hey trumpet

1025
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:54,482
Yes sir ?

1026
01:43:55,021 --> 01:43:56,147
What's the most requested
song nowadays ?

1027
01:43:58,458 --> 01:44:02,485
Babu'ji, slow it down now

1028
01:44:03,863 --> 01:44:04,830
Stand up here

1029
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:08,325
Play

1030
01:44:19,212 --> 01:44:21,180
l heard you took an American
to his wedding altar

1031
01:44:26,219 --> 01:44:28,187
No, sir

1032
01:44:28,421 --> 01:44:32,858
l know their names.
l want to know where they are

1033
01:44:40,066 --> 01:44:44,025
Harry says, he was so smooth,
and convincing. Harry's no fool

1034
01:44:44,737 --> 01:44:46,364
And you believed ?
- l did

1035
01:44:46,572 --> 01:44:50,201
lt was in the Times of lndia.
- All newspapers say...

1036
01:44:50,410 --> 01:44:52,807
all Americans have sex all the day,
l believe ?

1037
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:59,210
Don't look at it, you hear me ?
Don't look at it

1038
01:44:59,452 --> 01:45:02,546
Sir how about leaving ?
What can we possibly get to know here ?

1039
01:45:02,755 --> 01:45:06,885
Here you learn
to what lengths a man can go...

1040
01:45:07,093 --> 01:45:07,718
for the smallest of things

1041
01:45:09,262 --> 01:45:13,221
Get the serial numbers of the currency
that he withdrew from his bank

1042
01:45:14,267 --> 01:45:16,064
Tell me joke

1043
01:45:16,769 --> 01:45:17,565
Non-veg

1044
01:45:31,150 --> 01:45:34,916
Tired of turning wheels ? Now watch
how the wheels of fortune turn

1045
01:45:36,122 --> 01:45:41,082
l didn't see a thing. What can l say?
l'm a simple honest man

1046
01:45:41,461 --> 01:45:46,421
God ! This one turns out to be honest!
Wheel back that car...

1047
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:49,097
go on... back out...

1048
01:45:49,635 --> 01:45:54,595
go away, far away

1049
01:45:55,308 --> 01:45:56,935
There. Stop

1050
01:45:57,643 --> 01:46:00,942
The longer the distance,
the more it looks like an accident

1051
01:46:01,180 --> 01:46:05,947
Don't move or l'll shoot.
- Sir, what are you saying ?

1052
01:46:06,185 --> 01:46:09,621
l told you ! l saw nothing.
- No one's ever seen...

1053
01:46:09,822 --> 01:46:11,619
what's about to happen right now

1054
01:46:12,725 --> 01:46:15,125
Come on, slam the car.
- No... please

1055
01:46:15,328 --> 01:46:17,796
Slam him.
- Please ! No...

1056
01:46:19,532 --> 01:46:20,123
l saw, l saw! l saw everything

1057
01:46:20,333 --> 01:46:21,459
Turn off the engine

1058
01:46:22,001 --> 01:46:23,298
Stand straight

1059
01:46:25,905 --> 01:46:32,555
See no evil. Speak no evil. Hear no evil
but if you can profit, grab it

1060
01:46:33,179 --> 01:46:36,637
Gandhi'ji would've come here personally
to whack you for being so honest

1061
01:46:37,350 --> 01:46:41,480
Who else was in it with them?
Go on, give him every detail

1062
01:46:42,922 --> 01:46:46,323
What's wrong ? Why are you sulking?
You're upset with me ?

1063
01:46:46,592 --> 01:46:51,996
Moron, the Taj got sold, not your taxi.
Like some nuts ? No ? Suit yourself

1064
01:46:52,198 --> 01:46:56,328
There was no corner of the country
Bunty and Babli hadn't been to

1065
01:46:56,536 --> 01:47:00,495
And every newspaper
was cheering their ingenuity

1066
01:47:00,740 --> 01:47:04,335
But l was dying to see them
behind bars

1067
01:47:04,336 --> 01:47:07,002
6 MONTH LATER

1068
01:47:07,580 --> 01:47:10,845
No there's no mistake about this order.
Your assignment is being changed

1069
01:47:11,050 --> 01:47:14,850
But l've completely
committed myself to the case

1070
01:47:15,721 --> 01:47:18,019
Bunty-Babli's case is being assigned
to the federal agencies

1071
01:47:18,224 --> 01:47:20,021
To whom ?
- Federal investigation

1072
01:47:20,226 --> 01:47:21,352
God !

1073
01:47:22,728 --> 01:47:27,028
Our politicians have become honest?
The feds have time for Bunty and Babli ?

1074
01:47:27,233 --> 01:47:30,031
They have your sympathies?
- Not those two

1075
01:47:30,236 --> 01:47:34,696
My sympathies are with the feds.
- You think the feds can't get them ?

1076
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:38,868
Why ?
- Because they can't think like them

1077
01:47:39,078 --> 01:47:40,875
And you can?

1078
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:43,878
l'm beginning to feel
we're related somehow

1079
01:47:47,587 --> 01:47:51,045
From tomorrow, you're taking charge
of the gold at the airport

1080
01:47:56,629 --> 01:47:57,561
Very well sir

1081
01:47:58,631 --> 01:47:59,893
You're the boss

1082
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:03,393
l'll take charge of hell
if you want me to

1083
01:48:04,103 --> 01:48:06,571
Anyway what's the score?
- What ?

1084
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:11,398
l found myself a night-watchman's job.
This is how l got to bide my time

1085
01:48:12,645 --> 01:48:13,236
Dashrath Singh...

1086
01:48:16,515 --> 01:48:19,916
lf there's anybody who'll lay a finger
on Bunty and Babli, it's me

1087
01:48:33,132 --> 01:48:36,431
You find this funny ?
You can do this yourself the next time

1088
01:48:36,636 --> 01:48:39,104
l won't be able to do this
even if l tried, love

1089
01:48:40,306 --> 01:48:42,433
But you can make a mockery of
those who do ?

1090
01:48:43,142 --> 01:48:48,603
Ok, l'm sorry
- What idiot could've made you a father

1091
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:51,116
You

1092
01:48:55,488 --> 01:48:58,457
One rum, large

1093
01:48:59,158 --> 01:49:01,126
You don't need to pay sir

1094
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:03,794
Did l mention l'm a policeman?
- Hear me out, sir

1095
01:49:04,030 --> 01:49:08,626
The gentleman out there is hosting
food and drinks for all guests tonight

1096
01:49:08,834 --> 01:49:11,302
Who...?
- The man in black

1097
01:49:12,505 --> 01:49:14,302
They're buying this restaurant

1098
01:49:14,507 --> 01:49:18,307
No way. We're picking up the tab
for everyone tonight

1099
01:49:18,511 --> 01:49:21,139
Not tonight. Tomorrow

1100
01:49:21,514 --> 01:49:28,317
From tomorrow, this hotel is yours
to do as you please. But tonight's on me

1101
01:49:28,688 --> 01:49:35,992
Friends, cocktails and dinner
for everyone on the house

1102
01:49:39,198 --> 01:49:39,823
Vodka

1103
01:49:44,603 --> 01:49:45,262
Whiskey

1104
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:47,664
Cocktail?

1105
01:49:49,542 --> 01:49:50,201
Gin

1106
01:49:55,047 --> 01:49:56,014
Rum

1107
01:49:58,551 --> 01:50:03,181
Flying to the moon?
- You're selling the tickets ?

1108
01:50:04,223 --> 01:50:06,691
You've just bought yourself
a one-way ticket

1109
01:50:08,227 --> 01:50:14,860
l don't believe much in buying tickets
but yes, l do want to fly to the moon

1110
01:50:15,234 --> 01:50:16,861
You're a man in a hurry?

1111
01:50:18,904 --> 01:50:19,871
Somewhat

1112
01:50:21,907 --> 01:50:24,535
There's this one place in which
men-in-a-hurry usually end up

1113
01:50:31,083 --> 01:50:32,550
You see...
- What ?

1114
01:50:33,452 --> 01:50:38,219
This world we live in
has two kinds of people

1115
01:50:38,424 --> 01:50:41,723
l see.
- One, the kind that listens

1116
01:50:41,994 --> 01:50:48,058
And the kind that talks.
l belong to the latter

1117
01:50:50,803 --> 01:50:55,740
So sure of yourself ? What do you do?
- Cleaning

1118
01:50:57,943 --> 01:51:02,403
l'm in the cleaning business.
We clean out places

1119
01:51:02,782 --> 01:51:05,250
What kind of places ?
- Any kind

1120
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:12,250
So you like tidy places?
- No, l like tidy sums of money

1121
01:51:15,294 --> 01:51:19,253
lnteresting man.
Where are you from?
- Allahabad

1122
01:51:19,498 --> 01:51:22,592
Aha, you look that type

1123
01:51:23,836 --> 01:51:25,428
Sir, one more large ?

1124
01:51:26,472 --> 01:51:27,598
Bring it on then

1125
01:51:30,810 --> 01:51:32,141
What's happening here ?

1126
01:51:32,645 --> 01:51:36,445
You're smoking in front of your baby?
- How the hell can he see me ?

1127
01:51:36,649 --> 01:51:39,117
Babies know everything.
- How can they know everything ?

1128
01:51:39,318 --> 01:51:39,909
Stop it !

1129
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:45,780
l get the feeling l'm her baby

1130
01:51:46,492 --> 01:51:47,789
And he who is he ?

1131
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:49,618
l... am...
- He is...

1132
01:51:49,829 --> 01:51:51,456
Whoever, doesn't matter. Come on

1133
01:51:52,198 --> 01:51:55,292
Women... are like this only.
- How and how do you think women are ?

1134
01:51:56,502 --> 01:52:00,302
Oye, don't stoke my anger.
- Hello, what's happening here ?

1135
01:52:01,173 --> 01:52:04,973
A fight can't you see?
- That l can, but why ?

1136
01:52:05,177 --> 01:52:09,807
Private matters of husband-wife!
How meddlesome !

1137
01:52:10,349 --> 01:52:11,475
Please stub that out

1138
01:52:12,351 --> 01:52:15,149
You look like a long lost father!
Ought to be setting an example for him

1139
01:52:16,088 --> 01:52:19,319
And you better come along.
l'm checking out the rooms in this hotel

1140
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:21,986
Don't take too long

1141
01:52:26,565 --> 01:52:30,001
Don't come back in an hour or two.
Spoilt the mood for no rhyme or reason

1142
01:52:30,536 --> 01:52:32,663
You seem to be much fallen-in-love

1143
01:52:36,542 --> 01:52:40,501
You've never fallen... in love?

1144
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:47,018
Once, a little

1145
01:52:48,554 --> 01:52:49,680
What?

1146
01:52:51,056 --> 01:52:52,182
A little

1147
01:52:57,396 --> 01:53:02,857
ln a summer of Delhi
l came upon her

1148
01:53:04,069 --> 01:53:07,869
Every single day on bus number 481 ...

1149
01:53:08,541 --> 01:53:11,203
l would fall all over myself
to vacate the ladies' seat...

1150
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:14,208
and she would sit down
with the sweetest smile

1151
01:53:17,283 --> 01:53:20,047
For a whole year...
- You never spoke ?

1152
01:53:20,286 --> 01:53:26,555
When our eyes were saying so much
how could words dare to interfere ?

1153
01:53:28,827 --> 01:53:29,623
But...

1154
01:53:32,431 --> 01:53:35,229
l can shower her with gifts, can't l ?

1155
01:53:35,768 --> 01:53:41,070
So every week, l'd fall over myself
to give her my gift

1156
01:53:41,273 --> 01:53:42,740
And she...
- Would smile ?

1157
01:53:42,942 --> 01:53:43,567
And take it

1158
01:53:44,777 --> 01:53:49,908
And l'm sure that one day, in return for
all my gifts she would give me...

1159
01:53:50,115 --> 01:53:54,575
that one big gift l've been
waiting for.
- So did the gift arrive ?

1160
01:53:54,853 --> 01:53:56,081
Winter arrived

1161
01:53:58,958 --> 01:54:00,926
On the 2 1 st of December...

1162
01:54:01,961 --> 01:54:06,921
wrapped in a maroon shawl
and a warm smile...

1163
01:54:07,132 --> 01:54:09,259
she stepped into the bus.
Radiance on her face and in her hands...

1164
01:54:09,468 --> 01:54:15,100
a Golden Bakery box.
lnside that box...

1165
01:54:16,175 --> 01:54:22,944
were the world's most beautiful
heart shaped... you know...

1166
01:54:23,816 --> 01:54:26,284
heart-shaped pastries

1167
01:54:28,821 --> 01:54:32,450
And then
for the first time in a year...

1168
01:54:34,827 --> 01:54:37,955
she spoke her first words to me

1169
01:54:43,235 --> 01:54:44,293
Please...

1170
01:54:46,372 --> 01:54:50,308
would you distribute these pastries
to all the passengers

1171
01:54:50,843 --> 01:54:52,640
l just got engaged

1172
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:02,960
Ei handsome
- Yeah?

1173
01:55:04,857 --> 01:55:06,154
What happened ?

1174
01:55:29,048 --> 01:55:30,174
She's calling you

1175
01:55:32,217 --> 01:55:33,013
Who is ?

1176
01:55:33,952 --> 01:55:37,353
Tonight's your night

1177
01:55:40,726 --> 01:55:46,187
Those pangs you feel in your heart
have pained me too

1178
01:55:47,900 --> 01:55:52,200
Why not drown our pains tonight?

1179
01:55:54,406 --> 01:55:55,031
Nice

1180
01:56:02,915 --> 01:56:09,718
Rare are those moments in life
when desire calls

1181
01:56:12,257 --> 01:56:16,557
Come into my arms,
or come and slit my throat

1182
01:56:28,273 --> 01:56:29,740
Oh forget it...

1183
01:56:30,442 --> 01:56:33,070
this give and take of hearts
takes a lot of heart...

1184
01:56:33,612 --> 01:56:39,244
and doing it so boldly for the world
to see... it's a woman's art you see

1185
01:56:40,119 --> 01:56:43,452
ln this winning and losing
of hearts what are men worth ?

1186
01:56:46,625 --> 01:56:55,761
<i>His ruthless gaze...</i>

1187
01:56:55,968 --> 01:56:58,937
<i>tore up the street...</i>

1188
01:56:59,705 --> 01:57:05,940
<i>took me apart</i>

1189
01:57:06,745 --> 01:57:11,114
<i>lt ran a razor's edge
down the willing side of my heart</i>

1190
01:57:48,821 --> 01:57:51,813
<i>TmG</i>

1191
01:57:53,659 --> 01:57:56,822
<i>l fall to restless pieces...</i>

1192
01:57:58,697 --> 01:58:03,498
<i>don't look at me that way</i>

1193
01:58:03,702 --> 01:58:13,668
<i>l fall to restless pieces,
don't look at me that way</i>

1194
01:58:24,723 --> 01:58:29,160
<i>A townful of men in ruin
surrenders to what l say</i>

1195
01:58:29,728 --> 01:58:31,195
<i>stretch with desire, l take my bow</i>

1196
01:58:31,396 --> 01:58:33,864
<i>l stretch with desire...</i>

1197
01:58:34,066 --> 01:58:36,034
<i>come touch me now</i>

1198
01:58:36,602 --> 01:58:41,301
<i>Night eyes...</i>

1199
01:58:41,507 --> 01:58:46,171
<i>night eyes... your night eyes...</i>

1200
01:58:46,612 --> 01:58:56,214
<i>The moon sleeps inside those night eyes</i>

1201
01:58:56,421 --> 01:59:01,381
<i>Night eyes, your night eyes
Night falls inside those night eyes</i>

1202
01:59:01,627 --> 01:59:06,724
<i>Night eyes, my night eyes
We are one inside twin night eyes</i>

1203
01:59:34,293 --> 01:59:37,387
<i>Night eyes, your night eyes
The moon sleeps inside those night eyes</i>

1204
01:59:39,231 --> 01:59:43,565
<i>These sighs you swore,
wrote them in kohl</i>

1205
01:59:44,236 --> 01:59:49,003
<i>Come to life inside these eyes</i>

1206
01:59:49,207 --> 01:59:53,268
<i>That kiss you left on my handkerchief</i>

1207
01:59:53,912 --> 01:59:56,210
<i>l knot it until it dies</i>

1208
01:59:56,415 --> 01:59:59,111
<i>Oh your words are wisps
from incense bowls</i>

1209
02:00:04,323 --> 02:00:14,631
<i>You waft in lazy
like the warm wind rolls</i>

1210
02:00:14,833 --> 02:00:18,963
<i>l bow, l stretch... come touch me</i>

1211
02:00:19,171 --> 02:00:41,516
<i>l stretch with desire, l take my bow</i>

1212
02:01:19,398 --> 02:01:22,629
<i>Night eyes, my night eyes
You're a shadow inside my night eyes</i>

1213
02:01:24,403 --> 02:01:27,839
<i>These eyes take me by surprise</i>

1214
02:01:29,474 --> 02:01:34,275
<i>Ask private questions, brook no lies</i>

1215
02:01:34,479 --> 02:01:38,313
<i>Hide under those veil-like lids</i>

1216
02:01:39,418 --> 02:01:44,185
<i>The curtains behind which she shies</i>

1217
02:01:44,322 --> 02:01:49,555
<i>No curtains hide my pain,
no lies try to guard me</i>

1218
02:02:27,099 --> 02:02:31,763
<i>l hurt only when
she gives her word not to scar me</i>

1219
02:02:32,170 --> 02:02:36,470
<i>Night eyes, your night eyes l was
stung when l sung to your night eyes</i>

1220
02:02:48,987 --> 02:02:51,854
<i>Night eyes, your night eyes
The moon sleeps inside my night eyes</i>

1221
02:02:52,023 --> 02:02:55,186
<i>You are mine
in the memories of old stone cities</i>

1222
02:02:55,327 --> 02:02:57,852
<i>Our songs still echo
in those forlorn cities</i>

1223
02:02:58,330 --> 02:03:01,197
<i>From the south gate arch
to where the north gate lies...</i>

1224
02:03:02,033 --> 02:03:05,935
<i>you and l are lore set in stone cities</i>

1225
02:03:06,138 --> 02:03:10,165
<i>l hear the call of the saint on the wall</i>

1226
02:03:10,342 --> 02:03:12,242
<i>And swear
by the black beauty of your eyes</i>

1227
02:03:12,444 --> 02:03:14,378
<i>l'm the guardian
from evil your eyes never had</i>

1228
02:03:14,579 --> 02:03:16,638
<i>l'll suffuse them with smiles
so they never look sad</i>

1229
02:03:16,815 --> 02:03:19,215
<i>Our bodies, they ache
Our lips, they quake</i>

1230
02:03:19,216 --> 02:03:20,995
<i>Come touch me, oh touch me,
oh touch me now</i>

1231
02:03:20,996 --> 02:03:23,198
<i>Tonight is the night,
the night is tonight</i>

1232
02:03:23,199 --> 02:03:25,155
<i>Tonight's the night,

Madam, l am your only Adam

1239
02:04:34,693 --> 02:04:40,928
Night eyes...
oh the dark of her nights in my eyes

1240
02:04:41,099 --> 02:04:45,229
Why do you dole out free drinks?

1241
02:04:45,937 --> 02:04:52,900
Why give free drinks, you fool!
How will you run your hotel ?

1242
02:04:56,781 --> 02:04:57,577
Anyway...

1243
02:04:59,451 --> 02:05:01,248
l enjoyed your company

1244
02:05:03,788 --> 02:05:08,748
l feel satisfied and a little in love

1245
02:05:09,661 --> 02:05:17,261
And it helped me forget those two

1246
02:05:20,472 --> 02:05:26,775
Forget them... you've nothing to do
with those scoundrels

1247
02:05:32,350 --> 02:05:34,079
Generally...

1248
02:05:39,157 --> 02:05:42,615
l don't take to strangers too well

1249
02:05:44,329 --> 02:05:46,456
But l don't know...

1250
02:05:49,367 --> 02:05:57,968
l don't know why the two of you
have touched my heart

1251
02:06:00,378 --> 02:06:04,109
We've done what...?
- Touched my heart...

1252
02:06:05,684 --> 02:06:10,314
you could've been my children

1253
02:06:11,856 --> 02:06:14,984
You haven't told us your name.
- You haven't told...

1254
02:06:15,593 --> 02:06:17,823
My name is Dashrath

1255
02:06:18,863 --> 02:06:23,493
Dashrath Singh,
Deputy Commissioner of Police

1256
02:06:24,602 --> 02:06:32,509
You're a police'wallah?
- What did you think ? Balloon' wallah?

1257
02:06:37,048 --> 02:06:38,515
Why what's come over you ?

1258
02:06:40,385 --> 02:06:42,012
What's it ?
- Sir, Rickshaw' wallah...

1259
02:06:42,721 --> 02:06:44,018
Sit in the rickshaw

1260
02:06:44,389 --> 02:06:46,857
Go on, take him home.
- Yes, take me home

1261
02:06:47,058 --> 02:06:49,185
lt's very late.
- Very late at night

1262
02:06:51,096 --> 02:06:57,194
Take me to the airport
... no not there

1263
02:06:57,902 --> 02:07:01,861
l'm going to Police Lines.
- Go on, quick

1264
02:07:10,782 --> 02:07:14,377
Oh my God, the very same Dashrath
Singh the one who's been after us ?

1265
02:07:16,254 --> 02:07:20,884
My baby almost had a heart attack!
That was close, let's get out of here

1266
02:07:21,459 --> 02:07:28,388
Get out ? The fun's only just begun
- What are you talking about ?

1267
02:07:31,002 --> 02:07:38,738
Look, he never knew what we look like.
He still doesn't. But now...

1268
02:07:38,943 --> 02:07:42,401
we know who he is
and we also know that...

1269
02:07:42,981 --> 02:07:47,577
he's in charge of the security
of the gold stashed at the airport

1270
02:07:50,155 --> 02:07:54,922
By God ! You are...
- Vimmi, if we don't...

1271
02:07:55,126 --> 02:07:56,252
steal the meat
right from the lion's den...

1272
02:07:56,461 --> 02:07:59,658
what did we achieve?
- Your hunger's getting out of hand

1273
02:08:02,267 --> 02:08:07,899
Now we're a threesome. We'll need
more food... what do you say ?

1274
02:08:09,707 --> 02:08:10,639
You'll get us killed someday

1275
02:08:17,148 --> 02:08:19,275
lndia's Central Bank doesn't keep
it's gold in any one place

1276
02:08:19,484 --> 02:08:22,612
To protect the gold from
fires, floods or earthquakes...

1277
02:08:22,921 --> 02:08:24,912
the cache is split over
four different cities

1278
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:27,958
Depending on the requirements
of various banks...

1279
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:32,287
this gold is shuttled by air between
these four cities once every week

1280
02:08:33,998 --> 02:08:38,298
How they cracked this confidential
information, they haven't divulged

1281
02:08:39,170 --> 02:08:43,470
But what they did that day
no one could have ever imagined

1282
02:08:44,342 --> 02:08:45,138
Not even me...

1283
02:08:48,847 --> 02:08:52,476
Delhi-Mumbai, 9.1 0 pm tonight.
Korpal, Puneet, Mr

1284
02:08:53,218 --> 02:08:59,316
Delhi-Calcutta, 9.40 pm.
Sharma, Vandana, Mrs

1285
02:09:00,525 --> 02:09:03,153
What's this other ticket for?
- Backup

1286
02:09:17,041 --> 02:09:19,839
Why the Air Traffic
Control number?- Backup

1287
02:09:20,378 --> 02:09:26,010
A back up for everything?
Oye Rakesh, is there one for you too ?

1288
02:09:27,552 --> 02:09:28,348
Yes

1289
02:09:28,553 --> 02:09:29,212
Who ?

1290
02:09:30,722 --> 02:09:31,347
You

1291
02:09:34,392 --> 02:09:35,188
Smart

1292
02:11:16,661 --> 02:11:20,620
Call back the Jet airways flight
Mumbai. The bomb is ticking

1293
02:11:20,732 --> 02:11:23,826
What nonsense.
A bomb on the plane ?

1294
02:11:30,508 --> 02:11:32,806
Jet 9W31 2. Yes Delhi Control ?

1295
02:11:33,244 --> 02:11:36,304
Turn back and proceed for landing
on emergency runway number 2

1296
02:11:36,514 --> 02:11:37,981
There is a bomb scare

1297
02:11:38,182 --> 02:11:39,308
Delhi Control is this a joke?

1298
02:11:39,517 --> 02:11:40,643
Bomb on board, he says

1299
02:11:40,852 --> 02:11:45,152
Jet 9W31 2. Turning back

1300
02:11:46,357 --> 02:11:49,815
Which runway?
- Number 2. Bomb squad is on the runway

1301
02:11:50,028 --> 02:11:51,655
The caller's number. Get it now

1302
02:11:51,863 --> 02:11:52,659
Go get the number from them. Now !

1303
02:11:53,531 --> 02:11:54,828
We can't have the number

1304
02:11:55,033 --> 02:11:59,333
lt isn't under our jurisdiction.
- As long as the gold is on board...

1305
02:11:59,537 --> 02:12:01,334
this plane, the bomb, this airport,
everything is under our jurisdiction

1306
02:12:46,250 --> 02:12:48,718
How many people knew about the gold?
- Four bank employees

1307
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:51,388
Are you implying the news was leaked?
- Give me the key to the box

1308
02:12:51,589 --> 02:12:53,386
But we are not permitted to open it.
- Give me the key

1309
02:12:53,591 --> 02:12:55,889
Now it's your responsibility.
- The bomb might explode any time, sir

1310
02:12:56,094 --> 02:13:01,396
The bomb has exploded. Send message to
headquarters. l am assuming command

1311
02:13:16,114 --> 02:13:17,240
DCP Dashrath Singh here...

1312
02:13:17,949 --> 02:13:19,416
Surround the airport area

1313
02:13:19,951 --> 02:13:23,250
Locate persons who do not have
any reason to be here at this hour

1314
02:13:23,621 --> 02:13:27,421
Take suspects into custody
and inform immediately

1315
02:13:36,634 --> 02:13:38,261
They received the bomb scare
from this number

1316
02:13:38,469 --> 02:13:39,128
Dial

1317
02:13:44,475 --> 02:13:45,601
Ringing

1318
02:14:58,382 --> 02:15:00,850
Orange Maruti Swift 5700

1319
02:15:07,225 --> 02:15:12,026
Vimmi we'll have to ditch this car.
They've spotted it. Get out !

1320
02:15:31,749 --> 02:15:33,546
Stop... taxi

1321
02:15:34,585 --> 02:15:38,316
Stop... please

1322
02:15:42,093 --> 02:15:46,723
Papa'ji, please help us ! l'll give you
more money than you ever imagined

1323
02:15:46,931 --> 02:15:50,389
Son, for this job, l won't take money
even if you give it to me...

1324
02:15:50,601 --> 02:15:55,231
come my child, get up,
you'll do fine

1325
02:15:55,439 --> 02:15:58,067
Have faith in god. Faith prevails

1326
02:15:58,276 --> 02:16:03,236
Sir, what are you saying ? Policemen
in every hospital and nursing home ?

1327
02:16:03,447 --> 02:16:06,299
We won't have men for policing the city.
- She's in labour. She's about to deliver

1328
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:08,908
She goes at dar for a moment

1329
02:16:10,788 --> 02:16:15,818
Every child born in Delhi tonight
will see a policeman's face...

1330
02:16:15,853 --> 02:16:18,057
before anything else

1331
02:16:19,630 --> 02:16:25,364
That Dashrath Singh figured me out.
- How are you so sure?

1332
02:16:25,970 --> 02:16:30,430
l know. l saw it in his eyes...

1333
02:16:34,145 --> 02:16:34,736
Then...

1334
02:16:35,479 --> 02:16:39,609
in no time every hospital in Delhi
will be crawling with policemen

1335
02:16:41,319 --> 02:16:44,186
Which hospital
do you want to go to son ?

1336
02:16:45,756 --> 02:16:48,452
The biggest...
the biggest hospital in Delhi

1337
02:16:48,659 --> 02:16:53,062
Not a hospital or nursing home,
they'll go to a nondescript clinic

1338
02:16:54,498 --> 02:17:00,960
lf l know that Bunty, he'll definitely
take Babli to the biggest hospital

1339
02:17:06,444 --> 02:17:08,469
Vimmi, don't be afraid

1340
02:17:08,679 --> 02:17:13,878
This hospital is packed choc-a-bloc
with newborns and their mothers

1341
02:17:14,085 --> 02:17:15,814
lt'll take them ages to check each bed.
But you please hurry it up

1342
02:17:16,020 --> 02:17:18,648
lt isn't in my hands, bloody idiot !

1343
02:17:19,624 --> 02:17:22,320
l told you
you'll get us killed someday

1344
02:17:22,526 --> 02:17:23,493
Hush

1345
02:17:23,794 --> 02:17:29,232
But hey, what life did l have
before l met you ?

1346
02:17:44,548 --> 02:17:46,345
ls everything all right?
- Yes

1347
02:17:48,486 --> 02:17:51,683
Papa'ji... if you weren't here today...
- There would have been someone else

1348
02:17:52,556 --> 02:17:55,684
The Lord up there runs
a regular courier service

1349
02:17:56,727 --> 02:18:00,026
He always provides for ones in need

1350
02:18:38,769 --> 02:18:40,066
Where are you going ?

1351
02:18:40,271 --> 02:18:42,739
You can't go in

1352
02:19:13,137 --> 02:19:17,198
Pointless... he must've taped
the gate downstairs. Walk

1353
02:19:30,921 --> 02:19:33,287
Those two have fled the hospital
but they haven't fled Delhi yet

1354
02:19:35,993 --> 02:19:37,620
Seal Delhi, sir

1355
02:19:47,838 --> 02:19:54,641
Papa'ji, all that you've done for us...
- One honest man would do for another

1356
02:19:56,847 --> 02:19:58,246
Papa'ji, you're kidding me

1357
02:20:00,117 --> 02:20:04,053
By now you must have figured that
we aren't half as honest as we seem

1358
02:20:07,191 --> 02:20:10,991
l don't know what you've done
to make these people hunt you down...

1359
02:20:13,697 --> 02:20:22,799
but l see a simple honesty
in your eyes... take care son.

1360
02:20:30,281 --> 02:20:32,181
God bless you

1361
02:20:56,240 --> 02:20:58,970
For the next week or so
they'll be baying for our blood

1362
02:20:59,210 --> 02:21:05,046
We'll return afterwards... but
where have you hidden the gold ?

1363
02:21:06,016 --> 02:21:07,540
What's your baby, a boy or a girl ?

1364
02:21:10,254 --> 02:21:11,482
What will you name your baby ?

1365
02:21:13,090 --> 02:21:17,220
Before you think of a name
you need to see the baby at least ?

1366
02:21:19,930 --> 02:21:24,594
A day has gone by, have you
even taken one look at your baby ?

1367
02:21:26,036 --> 02:21:30,735
Did you hold your child in your arms,
even once... once even ?

1368
02:21:38,282 --> 02:21:45,120
Vimmi, you know we didn't have any time
for these. Had l stopped for all this...

1369
02:21:45,422 --> 02:21:47,890
all three of us would've either been
jailed or killed by now

1370
02:21:48,626 --> 02:21:54,189
Some reason for celebration !
The day he is born... his parents die

1371
02:21:54,732 --> 02:21:58,600
Cursed fate to be born with !
- Not his fault, is it ?

1372
02:21:58,802 --> 02:22:01,032
That's what l'm saying!
What wrong has he done...

1373
02:22:01,639 --> 02:22:05,268
to deserve parents
who can go to jail anytime...

1374
02:22:05,976 --> 02:22:07,375
leaving him to rot on the streets

1375
02:22:12,483 --> 02:22:14,951
What are you trying to say?
- Enough

1376
02:22:16,987 --> 02:22:19,956
l won't do this anymore.
Neither will you...

1377
02:22:23,494 --> 02:22:29,364
Then what else can we do?
- Anything, whatever everyone else does

1378
02:22:31,502 --> 02:22:33,470
lf we had to end up doing
what everybody else does...

1379
02:22:33,704 --> 02:22:39,404
why did we ever run away from home?
- Because we were wrong

1380
02:22:45,316 --> 02:22:52,620
Now we're not free to live as we like.
Now we're responsible for one more life

1381
02:22:53,524 --> 02:22:57,255
How's he going to grow up?
- How ? With us, that's how

1382
02:22:57,861 --> 02:23:01,160
With us?
And which school will he go to ?

1383
02:23:02,533 --> 02:23:06,162
You know this world we live in
has two kinds of people. One...

1384
02:23:06,370 --> 02:23:10,170
who waste the best years of their lives
in schools and colleges. And...

1385
02:23:10,374 --> 02:23:15,334
the kind who school themselves. Like us.
We taught us to do what we're doing

1386
02:23:15,546 --> 02:23:17,343
Which is what he'll learn?
- Of course !

1387
02:23:17,715 --> 02:23:21,242
And then he'll go to jail someday?
- Have we ever been to jail?

1388
02:23:22,219 --> 02:23:24,687
We very nearly got thrown into jail

1389
02:23:25,990 --> 02:23:30,689
l don't want my son
growing up behind bars...

1390
02:23:31,895 --> 02:23:33,590
or dying young on the run

1391
02:23:35,065 --> 02:23:40,435
Do you remember agreeing on
all our marriage vows except...

1392
02:23:40,838 --> 02:23:42,533
We'll be Bunty-Babli
for the rest of our lives

1393
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:46,537
And we'll live out all our dreams.
- Except...

1394
02:23:47,578 --> 02:23:50,547
Except...?
- Leave that to me

1395
02:23:51,582 --> 02:23:52,207
Okay

1396
02:23:52,983 --> 02:23:54,382
This is the exception Rakesh

1397
02:23:55,586 --> 02:23:58,487
You're getting over-emotional
about this motherhood business

1398
02:24:02,092 --> 02:24:05,892
But now l am whatever l am.
Now l want to hear your decision

1399
02:24:06,597 --> 02:24:09,395
Choose. lt's either this life
... or a life together

1400
02:24:25,616 --> 02:24:26,913
So what have you decided?

1401
02:24:31,288 --> 02:24:32,915
What'll l do without the two of you ?

1402
02:24:40,464 --> 02:24:42,432
Those marriage vows
weren't mere words

1403
02:24:46,970 --> 02:24:48,369
Fursatganj or Pankinagar?

1404
02:24:50,140 --> 02:24:52,438
ls it you that's saying this or... ?

1405
02:24:52,643 --> 02:24:54,873
Bunty and Rakesh. -Both

1406
02:25:03,320 --> 02:25:03,877
What ?

1407
02:25:04,488 --> 02:25:05,045
Tickets

1408
02:25:08,826 --> 02:25:11,556
Since when are we buying tickets ?
- From today

1409
02:25:12,996 --> 02:25:14,623
Why become so damn honest ?

1410
02:25:24,007 --> 02:25:26,567
Oye Rakesh, you're in love

1411
02:25:28,679 --> 02:25:30,306
Oh all right

1412
02:25:33,183 --> 02:25:39,315
Rakesh my boy, this world we live in
has two kinds of men. One...

1413
02:25:39,523 --> 02:25:41,320
the kind that thinks twice
before getting married

1414
02:25:41,525 --> 02:25:44,494
And the kind that thinks afterwards
like you, you idiot

1415
02:25:49,199 --> 02:25:50,496
Two tickets for Fursatganj

1416
02:25:50,868 --> 02:25:51,459
Name ?

1417
02:25:52,536 --> 02:25:54,163
Rakesh Trivedi, Vimmi Trivedi

1418
02:25:57,708 --> 02:25:59,175
Bunty and Babli

1419
02:26:01,712 --> 02:26:04,340
You've had a long run.
You must be tired

1420
02:26:40,918 --> 02:26:42,044
Can we have some water ?

1421
02:26:44,254 --> 02:26:45,221
Die of thirst dog !

1422
02:26:46,590 --> 02:26:48,114
Not for me. For the two of them

1423
02:27:11,114 --> 02:27:15,414
You won't believe me but we quit
being crooks half an hour ago

1424
02:27:17,788 --> 02:27:23,249
Absolutely right, l won't believe you.
- But if l insist l'm telling the truth ?

1425
02:27:23,460 --> 02:27:27,089
l'll start doing right now
what l had planned to do to you in jail

1426
02:27:29,633 --> 02:27:32,431
Why are you looking at me like that ?
- He's telling the truth

1427
02:27:32,970 --> 02:27:36,428
Guaranteed by you,
lndia's biggest bonafide liar ?

1428
02:27:37,808 --> 02:27:39,105
l'm not lying

1429
02:27:39,409 --> 02:27:42,606
A dog's tail insists it became
ramrod straight half an hour ago ?

1430
02:27:42,813 --> 02:27:47,716
You're as old as my father... no one's
had the cheek to talk to her like that

1431
02:27:48,318 --> 02:27:51,287
So you respect your elders now, do you ?
- And why shouldn't we ?

1432
02:27:51,488 --> 02:27:53,786
Now don't tell me you pray
first thing every morning too !

1433
02:27:53,991 --> 02:27:54,958
She does

1434
02:27:55,659 --> 02:27:57,627
So...?
- So what !

1435
02:27:58,095 --> 02:28:03,465
Now you pray to your heart's content
in jail ! lt's all your fault...

1436
02:28:03,667 --> 02:28:05,464
now suffer.
- My fault ?

1437
02:28:06,003 --> 02:28:09,063
Who's idea was it to go straight ?
- lt was for a good cause...

1438
02:28:09,273 --> 02:28:12,071
do you want your son to go to jail ?
- So where's he going now ?

1439
02:28:12,442 --> 02:28:18,642
Now l see how the two of you
have been fooling people for years

1440
02:28:22,352 --> 02:28:23,478
Pappu is hungry

1441
02:28:24,855 --> 02:28:27,983
Pappu ?
When did we start calling him Pappu ?

1442
02:28:28,191 --> 02:28:32,560
Got to call him something no?
You're thinking of the gold all the time

1443
02:28:35,832 --> 02:28:41,361
Let's step outside for a while

1444
02:28:42,873 --> 02:28:45,341
l'm not going anywhere.
- Up

1445
02:28:48,078 --> 02:28:53,106
Darned luck. No one ever caught us
when we were in the thick of it

1446
02:28:54,117 --> 02:28:59,680
But the moment we quit...
- Why did you get into all this ?

1447
02:29:03,660 --> 02:29:10,828
l wanted to become someone important.
- And... you became ?

1448
02:29:13,070 --> 02:29:15,868
You won't understand.
- Why...

1449
02:29:17,140 --> 02:29:18,402
why won't l understand ?

1450
02:29:19,976 --> 02:29:21,876
Because he never did.
- Who ?

1451
02:29:23,747 --> 02:29:24,714
My father

1452
02:29:28,185 --> 02:29:29,482
He's just like you

1453
02:29:33,190 --> 02:29:34,885
You're trying to con me again

1454
02:29:42,933 --> 02:29:45,902
May l...?
- A smoke ? Sure...

1455
02:29:48,538 --> 02:29:49,470
Where are you going ?

1456
02:29:50,841 --> 02:29:52,638
lf she sees me smoking
she'll scream

1457
02:29:57,781 --> 02:29:59,578
The child will stay with the mother

1458
02:30:08,725 --> 02:30:10,317
What's the use of crying now ?

1459
02:30:12,195 --> 02:30:15,096
Should've considered this beforehand.
- What else to do ?

1460
02:30:17,968 --> 02:30:20,732
Become a ticket collector and
collect ten rupee bribes all my life ?

1461
02:30:29,813 --> 02:30:30,939
You can come in

1462
02:30:49,166 --> 02:30:51,464
We'll have to make a phone call
to your home or mine

1463
02:30:52,068 --> 02:30:56,471
We certainly can't take him with us.
- No, it won't come to that

1464
02:30:56,940 --> 02:31:00,569
l'll figure something.
- And con ourselves out of this one too ?

1465
02:31:00,777 --> 02:31:02,176
What else to do ?

1466
02:31:04,080 --> 02:31:08,107
Take with me to jail, the very son
for whose sake l gave up everything ?

1467
02:31:12,856 --> 02:31:17,343
What justice ! Jails are for reforming.
And here, three people are being jailed

1468
02:31:17,344 --> 02:31:21,161
Text: By RahelSurshi :)

1469
02:31:21,364 --> 02:31:24,231
Two of whom have reformed
and a third who's completely innocent

1470
02:31:26,036 --> 02:31:31,668
Don't worry Vimmi. l'll crack a plan.
- What plan Rakesh ?

1471
02:31:32,042 --> 02:31:33,703
We've run out of plans

1472
02:31:40,484 --> 02:31:42,679
Vimmi do you have any idea
what jails are like ?

1473
02:31:48,558 --> 02:31:50,458
How will you spend
so many years inside one ?

1474
02:31:54,664 --> 02:31:59,966
Let's do something,
l'll take the blame for everything

1475
02:32:02,239 --> 02:32:05,538
Then you're free to go home
to Fursatganj with the baby

1476
02:32:08,678 --> 02:32:10,873
All you wanted was to become a model

1477
02:32:13,250 --> 02:32:14,808
l dragged you into this whole thing

1478
02:32:21,057 --> 02:32:26,359
You can't even make a cup of tea
for yourself. ln jail... how ?

1479
02:32:26,530 --> 02:32:30,296
l'll manage Vimmi,
don't worry about me

1480
02:32:32,636 --> 02:32:34,695
Have you ever managed to do
anything alone ?

1481
02:32:34,971 --> 02:32:43,401
ln any case,
Bunty is nothing without Babli

1482
02:33:05,635 --> 02:33:06,567
Get up

1483
02:33:07,571 --> 02:33:08,435
Unlock yourselves...

1484
02:33:10,140 --> 02:33:11,038
l can't do it...

1485
02:33:12,976 --> 02:33:14,603
We're nearing the railway signal
on the outskirts of Delhi

1486
02:33:17,047 --> 02:33:18,605
The train halts there for two minutes

1487
02:33:20,750 --> 02:33:21,774
The two of...

1488
02:33:23,019 --> 02:33:27,319
The three of you can get off
and go wherever you wish

1489
02:33:28,692 --> 02:33:31,320
No one recognises
Bunty and Babli except me

1490
02:33:34,164 --> 02:33:35,529
And no one ever will

1491
02:33:55,051 --> 02:33:58,145
Sir...
- Shut up. Not a word

1492
02:33:59,022 --> 02:34:01,149
Or l just might change my mind

1493
02:34:02,192 --> 02:34:02,817
Get going

1494
02:34:06,196 --> 02:34:07,663
That's enough

1495
02:34:32,555 --> 02:34:38,221
Whether it was my life's biggest mistake
or their best con act, l didn't know

1496
02:34:40,397 --> 02:34:43,924
But policemen are human too,
believe it or not...

1497
02:34:45,135 --> 02:34:49,037
we wear those uniforms only on our body,
at heart we're as vulnerable as babies

1498
02:34:51,775 --> 02:34:57,873
l believed l had destroyed Bunty-Babli,
so l let Rakesh and Vimmi go...

1499
02:34:58,948 --> 02:35:06,320
because l think the law needs
to destroy crime, not lives

1500
02:35:07,657 --> 02:35:10,558
The bank's gold was recovered from
the spot Babli had indicated

1501
02:35:11,628 --> 02:35:18,557
The recoveries continued
for months afterwards...

1502
02:35:19,035 --> 02:35:22,061
Monies and valuables
stolen by Bunty and Babli

1503
02:35:22,272 --> 02:35:25,571
l think they had told me
the truth about going back...

1504
02:35:25,809 --> 02:35:29,802
to live respectable,
honest lives like their parents

1505
02:35:37,754 --> 02:35:40,587
Rakesh'ji could you perhaps
increase the pressure

1506
02:35:45,628 --> 02:35:46,424
What a joy

1507
02:35:50,467 --> 02:35:54,460
This world we live in
has two kinds of Pappus. One...

1508
02:35:55,004 --> 02:35:57,438
the kind who obey their parents
and get to eat chocolates

1509
02:35:57,841 --> 02:36:01,937
and the kind that doesn't
and gets locked up inside toilets

1510
02:36:02,145 --> 02:36:03,635
You are...?
- The first

1511
02:36:05,148 --> 02:36:06,615
My darling baby

1512
02:36:07,984 --> 02:36:11,442
But he didn't even drink his milk.
- He'll eat the chocolate

1513
02:36:12,322 --> 02:36:14,813
What good are chocolates?
You and your fads

1514
02:36:15,024 --> 02:36:19,393
No, l'm feeling cold...
- Forget the cold. Be fashionable

1515
02:36:25,401 --> 02:36:26,834
What are you teaching Pappu ?

1516
02:36:27,504 --> 02:36:31,964
To speak the truth
and pray every morning

1517
02:36:32,175 --> 02:36:35,542
Where's my son ? One of his friends
is waiting downstairs

1518
02:36:36,679 --> 02:36:39,876
Friends and folks in Fursatganj
find all the time for fun

1519
02:36:40,083 --> 02:36:43,678
You fix the name of this city.
l'll fix this friend

1520
02:36:47,924 --> 02:36:50,654
My son is genius from...

1521
02:36:51,661 --> 02:36:52,650
childhood

1522
02:36:53,663 --> 02:36:55,221
l am very lucky

1523
02:36:55,565 --> 02:36:58,659
l got a daughter-in-law
who is very very smart

1524
02:37:00,036 --> 02:37:03,096
lt's such a joy to know that
our son and his wife...

1525
02:37:03,306 --> 02:37:08,073
have done things so important that
your department still remembers them

1526
02:37:10,013 --> 02:37:15,815
Never told folks at home
what all you achieved ?

1527
02:37:16,553 --> 02:37:19,044
Maybe you should tell us

1528
02:37:21,558 --> 02:37:23,185
Nervous already ?

1529
02:37:25,562 --> 02:37:27,052
A scam is in the offing

1530
02:37:29,232 --> 02:37:30,494
Huge scam

1531
02:37:33,703 --> 02:37:34,670
Sir...

1532
02:37:37,006 --> 02:37:40,737
l swear by my son,
l've given it up

1533
02:37:42,245 --> 02:37:44,440
l've no idea of
what scams are happening

1534
02:37:45,982 --> 02:37:48,382
For three years now,
l'm following a work-home-work routine

1535
02:37:48,585 --> 02:37:51,782
This scam has got to be stopped.
- Then go ahead and stop it

1536
02:37:57,927 --> 02:37:59,121
We cannot stop it

1537
02:38:00,530 --> 02:38:01,929
Who else can ?

1538
02:38:05,702 --> 02:38:06,498
You

1539
02:38:11,674 --> 02:38:15,804
Then save me from this
respectable-dignified life ! Please

1540
02:38:16,145 --> 02:38:17,976
Who's saying this ?
You or...?
- We both

1541
02:38:19,949 --> 02:38:20,973
l'm through

1542
02:38:21,217 --> 02:38:24,744
lf l make mango pickle
one more time l'll die

1543
02:38:24,954 --> 02:38:26,581
lt's killing me, Rakesh

1544
02:38:45,141 --> 02:38:48,633
Keep the faith

1545
02:39:19,842 --> 02:39:22,675
Hace tiempo me dijo que estaba
en el negocio de la limpieza

1546
02:39:22,879 --> 02:39:25,814
Once upon a time he told me that
he was in the business of cleaning

1547
02:39:28,254 --> 02:40:00,146
