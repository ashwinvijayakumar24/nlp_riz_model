1
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:55,432
Would you please come with me, Sir?

2
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:00,273
Would you come with me, Sir?

3
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:18,640
Hands in front.

4
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:30,074
Hands behind your head.

5
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:31,834
Behind your head and turn around.

6
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,037
Open your mouth. Open your mouth.

7
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:50,552
Anything on the watch-list, George?

8
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:53,675
No flags. He's clean.

9
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:59,073
Okay. Mr. Khan, we are done here.

10
00:06:01,321 --> 00:06:02,436
You can go.

11
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:05,390
Put your stuff in your bag.

12
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:09,394
Gone. lt's gone.. my last flight
to Washington DC has left.

13
00:06:10,201 --> 00:06:12,192
The last American
Airlines flight has left.

14
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:15,034
The next flight leaves after
seven hours and five minutes.

15
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:18,033
United 59. United.. United 59.

16
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:23,429
lt leaves in the morning at 6.10.
Ticket $366.. it costs $366.

17
00:06:23,521 --> 00:06:26,194
l don't have the money.

18
00:06:26,281 --> 00:06:28,237
l have to take a bus
to Washington DC now.

19
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,393
Okay. l have to take a
bus to Washington DC now.

20
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:33,517
Why are you going to Washington DC?

21
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:37,272
l am going to meet the
President of the United States.

22
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:42,635
Why is that?
ls he a friend of yours?

23
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:45,872
Oh, no, no, no, no.
He's not a friend. No, no, no.

24
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:47,917
l have something to say to him.

25
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:50,599
Oh yeah?
- Yes.

26
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:53,951
Well, tell the President
something from me too then.

27
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:58,557
Okay. Okay.
- Tell him l said, howdy.

28
00:06:58,761 --> 00:07:01,400
Howdy? How.. Okay.

29
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:03,590
Pen?

30
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:08,677
J. Marshall.

31
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:11,076
John.
- John.

32
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:14,433
John.
- John. John Marshall says howdy.

33
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:17,030
Howdy. Okay. Howdy.

34
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:19,589
Yes. Okay. Okay.
John Marshall says..

35
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:22,639
But l have.. my own
message to give to him first.

36
00:07:22,721 --> 00:07:24,439
Oh yeah? What is that?

37
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:25,795
You know where Osama is?

38
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:30,238
Oh, no, no, no, no. No.
This is not my message. No, no, no.

39
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:33,437
What is your message, Mr. Khan?

40
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:35,833
l have to say to him..

41
00:07:37,561 --> 00:07:41,156
My name is Khan. And
l am not a terrorist.

42
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:39,794
May Allah bless this
letter l'm writing to you.

43
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:42,550
The book 'Different Minds' says..

44
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:45,917
..that people like us can't
express their emotions in words.

45
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:48,595
But we can write them easily.

46
00:08:48,881 --> 00:08:51,679
l can fill thousands of pages,
millions of times with..

47
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:53,513
'l love you, Mandira.'

48
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:56,076
But not once could l say it to you.

49
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,152
Perhaps that's why
you are angry with me.

50
00:08:58,281 --> 00:09:01,796
l had promised you that
l would meet the President..

51
00:09:01,881 --> 00:09:03,519
..so, my attempts are on.

52
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:07,389
Meanwhile whenever l have time,
l will write all..

53
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:09,676
..that l couldn't say to you.

54
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:14,035
And then, you will love me again.

55
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:23,311
My Abbu (father) Dilawar
Amanullah Khan worked for..

56
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:26,438
..the S.T. workshop in Borivali.

57
00:09:26,681 --> 00:09:28,273
He took me with him
to work everyday.

58
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:31,353
And left me to play in the garage.

59
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:35,076
l know how to repair
broken things since then.

60
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:39,599
Strangely, l could
never repair Abbu.

61
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:41,992
Hey, is this your dad's place?

62
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,673
Go home and kill your time.

63
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:45,115
Kill? Kill?

64
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:47,078
Get out now! Out!

65
00:09:57,121 --> 00:10:01,433
You fool! ldiot! Ruined my clothes!

66
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:11,471
Ammi.. Ammi.. Ammi..

67
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:13,474
Zakir is sleeping.

68
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:15,070
What's this?

69
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:17,277
'Kill time.'
- How did you get so wet?

70
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:18,794
'Kill time.' l want to 'kill time.'
- What?

71
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,509
Abdul Workshop asked me to
go home and 'kill time.'

72
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,473
How do l do that?

73
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:24,710
'Kill time? '

74
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:28,640
ls that what the devil told you?

75
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,191
Okay. l'll teach you
how to 'kill time.'

76
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:32,914
Like this. Like this.

77
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:35,520
This way.

78
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:47,474
Come on, Rizu.

79
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:50,192
Give me a hug.. just once?

80
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:53,436
Come on. Come on.

81
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:58,633
My Ammi (mother) Razia Khan.

82
00:10:58,721 --> 00:11:01,519
l feel peace when you hug me.

83
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:04,035
She was from Jalalpur, UP.

84
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:06,631
She embroidered clothes.

85
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:10,795
No doctor could tell her
why l was the way l was.

86
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:13,914
But Ammi.. She never
felt the need to know why.

87
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:16,556
l don't know how, but
she found a way to know me.

88
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:18,313
Just like you.

89
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:25,351
Fools! All of them!!

90
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:27,955
Each one of them should
be shot dead mercilessly!

91
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,713
Didn't even spare our women!

92
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:32,440
Dogs! Rogues! ldiots!

93
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:34,113
Are you guys with me?

94
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:35,953
Rogues. All of them.

95
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,714
Each one of them should
be shot dead mercilessly.

96
00:11:41,681 --> 00:11:43,353
l had told you not to step out.

97
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:45,200
Now, come on. Let's eat.

98
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:47,318
Rogues. All of them.

99
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:51,030
Each one of them should
be shot dead mercilessly.

100
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:52,919
Rogues. All of them.

101
00:11:53,001 --> 00:11:54,195
What did you say?

102
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:55,550
Rogues. All of them.

103
00:11:55,641 --> 00:11:56,710
Where did you hear that?

104
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:57,916
Each one of them
should be shot dead.

105
00:11:58,001 --> 00:11:59,070
Shut up!

106
00:11:59,161 --> 00:12:00,389
Rogues. All of them.

107
00:12:00,481 --> 00:12:02,392
Shut up, Rizu.

108
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:04,679
Come with me. Come.

109
00:12:04,881 --> 00:12:06,075
Look at this.

110
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:11,400
This is you. Rizvan. Who?

111
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:13,320
Rizvan.
- Yes.

112
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:18,357
And this is the person who
has a stick in his hand.

113
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:20,279
And he is beating you.

114
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:23,280
lt's bad.. beating is bad.
- Yes. lt's bad.

115
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:25,949
Now, this is you again, Rizvan.

116
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:31,676
And this is the
person who has a lollipop.

117
00:12:31,761 --> 00:12:32,830
And he gives it to you.

118
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:35,071
Lollipop is sweet.
lt's a good thing.

119
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:36,753
Good boy.
- Good boy.

120
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:41,313
Now, tell me which one of these is
a Hindu and which one, a Muslim?

121
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:47,513
Both look alike.

122
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,235
Good.

123
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:52,751
Remember one thing, son.

124
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:56,313
There are only two kinds
of people in this world.

125
00:12:57,681 --> 00:13:01,196
Good people who do good deeds.

126
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,915
And bad people who do bad.

127
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:07,434
That's the only
difference in human beings.

128
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:10,190
There's no other difference.
Understood?

129
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:14,077
What did you understand?
Tell me. Tell me.

130
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:18,712
Good people. Bad people.
No other difference.

131
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:22,874
Ammi's lesson was not
taught in any school.

132
00:13:23,241 --> 00:13:26,153
Not in my school at least.

133
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:41,552
Master Wadia lives somewhere here.

134
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:43,154
Give me the map.

135
00:13:45,121 --> 00:13:46,440
Come fast.

136
00:13:47,401 --> 00:13:53,397
Rizu, what are you doing?
Stop that and come here.

137
00:13:56,761 --> 00:13:59,434
Hang on. Coming.

138
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:04,200
Hello. l'm Razia. This
is Rizu. l mean Rizvan.

139
00:14:04,441 --> 00:14:06,477
l have heard a lot about you.

140
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:09,155
That you are a very learned man.
You have a lot of degrees.

141
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:10,635
B.A., M.A.

142
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:11,995
Whatever!

143
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:17,760
But people say you don't do anything.
That's a good thing!

144
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:24,470
Rizu. My Rizu is a sharp boy.

145
00:14:24,921 --> 00:14:28,231
So, l thought if you agree to
teach him here, in your house

146
00:14:28,321 --> 00:14:31,279
That way, you can pass
your time too, isn't it?

147
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:32,760
What nonsense!

148
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:36,391
Mr. Wadia. Mr. Wadia. Trust me.

149
00:14:36,841 --> 00:14:39,116
My Rizu is an intelligent boy.

150
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:42,639
Rizu.. Talk to Mr. Wadia in English.

151
00:14:42,721 --> 00:14:43,995
Speak in English. Come on.

152
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:45,514
Say something in English.

153
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:46,920
Wadia. Wadia.

154
00:14:47,481 --> 00:14:50,791
Wadia family is a Parsi
family originally based in Surat.

155
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:56,399
Launji Narsolaunji Wadia started the
Wadia ship building dynasty in 1 736.

156
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:59,314
When he obtained a contract from
the British East lndia Company..

157
00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:01,392
..for building docks
and ships in Bombay.

158
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:04,278
Wadia. Wadia.

159
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:07,797
The highway man came riding..

160
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:11,430
..riding up to the old lnn-door.

161
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:17,592
The highway man came
riding up to the old lnn-door.

162
00:15:19,441 --> 00:15:27,394
Ammi.. l'm hungry.
Let's go. l'm hungry.

163
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:30,791
Ammi said master
Wadia was a good man.

164
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:34,518
Good people did good deeds.

165
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:37,914
Master Wadia taught
me a lot of things.

166
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:41,152
About books. And about life too.

167
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:47,794
Rizvan. Rizvan, don't come here.

168
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:51,430
There's too much water.
Go home! Go home!

169
00:15:56,161 --> 00:15:57,833
Mr. Wadia. What are you doing?

170
00:15:57,921 --> 00:15:59,240
Come out!

171
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:02,313
Your pupil is amazing!

172
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:07,078
What's going on? Why
are you guys screaming?

173
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:12,519
Rizvan, what are you doing?
l asked you to go home.

174
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:23,275
Too good.

175
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,397
You are pumping water out.

176
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:28,393
That's amazing. Genius. Genius.

177
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:32,080
He is my pupil. My pupil.

178
00:16:47,641 --> 00:16:49,393
You think he can repair all this?

179
00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:51,233
You know, Mr. Wadia?

180
00:16:51,321 --> 00:16:55,951
My Rizu did nothing short of
a miracle near his house.

181
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,474
The water had filled till here.
- Mother!

182
00:16:57,561 --> 00:16:58,710
One minute!

183
00:16:58,801 --> 00:16:59,916
The water was till here.

184
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:01,878
Rizu fixed some motor type of thing.

185
00:17:01,961 --> 00:17:03,076
One minute!

186
00:17:03,161 --> 00:17:04,992
Put the motor in the water,
and the water was gone!

187
00:17:05,081 --> 00:17:06,434
l saw it with my own eyes.

188
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:08,159
Really?
- Yes.

189
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:14,029
Zakir.

190
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:16,272
You won a cup, didn't you?

191
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:19,032
l'm really happy about that.

192
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:21,355
And Rizu?

193
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,150
Even he is happy for you.

194
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:27,592
You should be happy too.

195
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:29,593
He is your brother, isn't he?

196
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,241
Good boy. Wipe your tears.

197
00:17:32,321 --> 00:17:33,640
Come on.

198
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:36,633
You are my good son, aren't you?

199
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:38,279
You are my good son, aren't you?

200
00:17:39,281 --> 00:17:41,237
You are my good son, aren't you?

201
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:43,792
You are my good son, aren't you?

202
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:48,121
Zakir was fortunate.

203
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:50,636
He could cry.

204
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:56,794
Zakir, Rizu says it's
going to be very cold there.

205
00:17:56,881 --> 00:17:59,953
You have taken everything,
right? Don't forget anything.

206
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:03,119
l will miss you, my son.

207
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:05,556
Only if you find time from
bhai (brother) will you miss me!

208
00:18:13,121 --> 00:18:16,875
As soon as he completed 18 years,
Zakir left for America.

209
00:18:17,121 --> 00:18:20,670
He got a scholarship
at Michigan University.

210
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:26,477
l felt very bad when he left.

211
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:29,833
But l never told him.

212
00:18:29,921 --> 00:18:34,358
And in just a few days,
l got accustomed to his absence.

213
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,354
Ammi. Hasina teaches
at the university.

214
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:40,435
She can't leave mid-term and come.

215
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:45,270
lt's her first Eid (festival)
in the family after the wedding.

216
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:50,791
We haven't even seen her yet.
Come here, please.

217
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:52,670
Ammi.

218
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:54,555
Don't worry.

219
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:56,791
Your immigration will
be done in a few days.

220
00:18:57,281 --> 00:18:58,999
Then you will live with us.

221
00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:05,200
l won't go anywhere without Rizvan.

222
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:08,315
l know that.

223
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:11,355
l'm sponsoring bhai as well.

224
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:16,232
Okay, Ammi. l have to hang
up now. l'll call later.

225
00:19:16,761 --> 00:19:18,080
Yeah?

226
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:39,070
Oh, Lord.
- Oh, lord.

227
00:19:42,441 --> 00:19:44,272
Ammi, you should sleep now.

228
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:47,080
Sleeping calms the mind and
provides rest to the body.

229
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:48,675
Shut up!

230
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:51,112
Nothing is wrong with me.

231
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,794
Just missing Zakir, that's all.

232
00:19:55,521 --> 00:19:56,749
His laughter.

233
00:19:57,481 --> 00:19:58,709
His anger.

234
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:00,959
The sound of his gargling.

235
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:04,431
At 7 am. At 2pm. 9pm.

236
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:28,877
Enough peace?

237
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:36,035
Please, Rizu. Two minutes?
Only two minutes.

238
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:39,273
Only two minutes?

239
00:20:44,081 --> 00:20:47,357
1001 , 1002.

240
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:50,752
But Mandira, the effect
of those two minutes..

241
00:20:50,841 --> 00:20:55,596
..lasted only for six months,
four days and 1 7 hours.

242
00:21:06,121 --> 00:21:10,717
Ammi died of
congestive cardiomyopathy.

243
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:14,714
Her heart became too
big for its own good.

244
00:21:24,801 --> 00:21:27,361
Before dying, Ammi made me promise..

245
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:30,911
..that like Zakir, l would
make a happy life for myself.

246
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:35,521
That l would go to America.

247
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:52,758
And then l came here..

248
00:21:52,841 --> 00:21:56,595
..to your favourite city.
San Francisco.

249
00:21:59,961 --> 00:22:04,830
And it was scary. Very scary.

250
00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:28,396
Bhai, this is Hasina.

251
00:22:29,161 --> 00:22:30,799
Hello, bhai.

252
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:33,800
How are you?

253
00:22:37,681 --> 00:22:38,909
Hope your flight was comfortable.

254
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:40,320
Hello.

255
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:43,439
Come on. Let's go in.

256
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:45,839
Hello to you too.

257
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:49,910
Zakir's wife, Hasina.

258
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:52,870
She was from Brooklyn, New York.

259
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:56,317
She taught psychology
in the university here.

260
00:22:57,281 --> 00:23:00,512
She was the first to find out..

261
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:14,313
..that l had Asperger's Syndrome.

262
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:19,754
My fear of new places. New people.

263
00:23:21,521 --> 00:23:25,116
My hatred for the colour
yellow and sharp sounds.

264
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:30,751
The reason for me
being so different..

265
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:33,992
..from everyone was
defined in just two words..

266
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:37,154
..Asperger's Syndrome.

267
00:23:39,321 --> 00:23:40,436
Take this.

268
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:41,670
When you look through this..

269
00:23:41,761 --> 00:23:43,513
..it will be like watching TV.

270
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:44,795
TV?

271
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,600
This way, you won't be
scared of new places or roads.

272
00:23:47,681 --> 00:23:48,750
Not scared?

273
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:51,833
No. Just press this button.
See.. try?

274
00:23:58,161 --> 00:24:00,277
l took bhai to the Autistic Society.

275
00:24:00,361 --> 00:24:02,397
Hi, Mrs. Brennan.
- Hi.

276
00:24:02,561 --> 00:24:04,472
Sorry.
- l had.

277
00:24:04,561 --> 00:24:06,950
Mrs. Brennan there
believes that bhai is better..

278
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,396
..than most people with Asperger's.

279
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:13,830
Maybe in odd ways, but at
least he can express his feelings.

280
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:17,519
And l think your Ammi had
a lot to with it, Zakir.

281
00:24:23,441 --> 00:24:25,113
Good morning.
- Good morning.

282
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:26,720
This is our office.

283
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:28,359
Come in. Have a good look.

284
00:24:28,441 --> 00:24:29,590
Have a good look.

285
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:31,512
What are you doing? Come this way.

286
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:33,918
What did l have when
l came to America?

287
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:35,798
Nothing. But today?

288
00:24:35,881 --> 00:24:37,553
See for yourself.

289
00:24:37,761 --> 00:24:40,195
l am the biggest dealer
for Mehnaz Herbal Products.

290
00:24:42,521 --> 00:24:44,637
Because this is America.
- America.

291
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:47,076
Here, the harder you work,
the more successful you get.

292
00:24:47,161 --> 00:24:47,832
America.

293
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:50,310
l have worked very hard.
Now, it's your turn.

294
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:51,516
America.
- Okay?

295
00:24:51,601 --> 00:24:52,875
Shall we? Come.

296
00:24:55,201 --> 00:24:56,873
Not that way. This way

297
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:57,711
America.

298
00:24:57,801 --> 00:25:01,874
Come. These are all our products
and these are the details.

299
00:25:02,121 --> 00:25:04,316
You will be given the names
and addresses of all the salons.

300
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:07,154
You will go to every one of
them and sell these. Understand?

301
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:08,117
No.

302
00:25:08,201 --> 00:25:09,475
You will.

303
00:25:17,201 --> 00:25:19,476
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products.

304
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,153
Mehnaz..

305
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:28,638
The rose water in the clay mask
cleans and clarifies your skin..

306
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:32,396
..and makes you glow
like a newly-wed bride.

307
00:25:33,361 --> 00:25:35,955
A newly-wed bride.

308
00:25:39,841 --> 00:25:44,437
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products.
All of them.

309
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:49,515
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products will
make you glow like a newly-wed bride.

310
00:25:49,601 --> 00:25:51,319
l'm divorced.

311
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,719
We have nothing for
the newly-divorced.

312
00:25:54,961 --> 00:25:56,758
Just a pimple cream won't help.

313
00:25:56,841 --> 00:26:00,151
You need to cleanse your face,
and your system.

314
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:03,039
l think that maybe l
just need a boyfriend.

315
00:26:03,121 --> 00:26:05,635
Oh, no, no. You
don't need a boyfriend.

316
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:08,838
You need this and Jamal Gota.

317
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:10,474
lndian laxative.

318
00:26:11,401 --> 00:26:14,757
lt says that the product
will reach you in seven days.

319
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:15,910
We're lying.

320
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:18,196
lt will reach you only in ten days.

321
00:27:22,761 --> 00:27:24,991
Move!

322
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:34,193
Come on! Move it!

323
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:38,316
Come on. Get out of
the way, you freak.

324
00:27:39,521 --> 00:27:40,590
No, no, no.

325
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:44,840
Get out of here. Come on.

326
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:46,070
Hey, you guys, just leave him alone.

327
00:27:46,161 --> 00:27:47,230
Stop it.

328
00:27:47,321 --> 00:27:49,391
Stop it, okay? Just go.

329
00:27:49,561 --> 00:27:50,880
Go, please.

330
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:54,680
Are you okay?

331
00:27:56,201 --> 00:27:57,475
Are you scared?

332
00:27:58,201 --> 00:27:59,475
lt's okay.

333
00:27:59,561 --> 00:28:01,791
Look, there's nothing
wrong with being scared.

334
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,517
Just don't make your fear so large..

335
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,034
..that it stops you
from achieving your goal.

336
00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:08,237
Okay? All right, bye.

337
00:28:47,281 --> 00:28:49,590
Hello. Welcome to Karma.

338
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:51,114
l'm the manager here.

339
00:28:51,201 --> 00:28:52,554
Can l help you?

340
00:28:54,521 --> 00:28:55,874
Oh God.

341
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:58,429
l think you have recognised me.

342
00:28:58,721 --> 00:29:00,837
lt's all right. Don't be shy.

343
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:03,710
l am Rita Singh. Ex Miss lndia.

344
00:29:04,361 --> 00:29:05,840
These blow-dryers..

345
00:29:05,921 --> 00:29:08,640
l am Rita Singh. Ex Miss lndia.

346
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:13,158
You look old. You must have
been Miss lndia before l was born.

347
00:29:13,241 --> 00:29:14,469
Okay?

348
00:29:20,281 --> 00:29:23,000
The theory of entrainment
in Physics states that..

349
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:28,951
..some specific sounds increase
the rate of your heartbeat.

350
00:29:34,881 --> 00:29:36,758
For me, Mandira..

351
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:42,030
..that specific sound has always
been the sound of your laughter.

352
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:45,920
So, you were coming here?

353
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:47,514
Don't take it personally, Rita.

354
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:50,073
l hope you've come for a haircut.

355
00:29:50,561 --> 00:29:52,392
You have got great hair.
- Okay.

356
00:29:52,801 --> 00:29:53,870
Okay.
- Okay.

357
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:54,791
Take an appointment.

358
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:58,999
My name is Rizvan Khan. Khan. Khan.

359
00:29:59,521 --> 00:30:02,240
l may look a little strange to you..

360
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:04,881
..but that's because
l have Asperger's Syndrome.

361
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:08,317
lt's named after Dr. Hans Asperger.

362
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:11,439
That doesn't mean l'm mad.

363
00:30:11,521 --> 00:30:13,239
Oh, no, no, no, no.

364
00:30:13,321 --> 00:30:15,152
l'm very intelligent.

365
00:30:15,241 --> 00:30:18,392
Very smart. Very smart.

366
00:30:18,481 --> 00:30:21,279
But there are certain
things l don't understand.

367
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,797
For instance, people say when l go
to their houses, ''Come, Rizvan..

368
00:30:24,881 --> 00:30:26,439
..think of it as your own house.''

369
00:30:26,521 --> 00:30:27,590
But how do l do that..

370
00:30:27,681 --> 00:30:29,353
..when the house isn't mine?

371
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:32,956
l don't understand why people
say one thing and think another.

372
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:36,158
My Ammi would say there are only
two kinds of people in the world.

373
00:30:36,241 --> 00:30:38,311
Good people and bad people.

374
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:39,754
l'm a good person.

375
00:30:39,841 --> 00:30:41,991
l do good deeds.

376
00:30:42,081 --> 00:30:44,800
l'm here to sell Mehnaz
Herbal Beauty products.

377
00:30:44,881 --> 00:30:46,234
l don't know how to sell.

378
00:30:46,321 --> 00:30:49,438
But my brother Zakir
tells me that's my job.

379
00:30:49,721 --> 00:30:51,712
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty products.

380
00:30:51,801 --> 00:30:53,393
..they are good products.

381
00:30:53,481 --> 00:30:55,631
l have tried them all on me.

382
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:58,633
That's why my skin glows.

383
00:30:58,721 --> 00:31:02,077
Shinning like a newly-wed bride.

384
00:31:02,641 --> 00:31:04,916
Allow me.. Allow me to show you..

385
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:08,676
..all the Mehnaz Herbal
Beauty products, please.

386
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:11,680
May l?

387
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:13,600
Yes, you can.

388
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,156
So tell me.

389
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:16,879
Which product will
make me beautiful?

390
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:18,110
No.

391
00:31:18,201 --> 00:31:21,034
No product can make you beautiful.

392
00:31:21,121 --> 00:31:22,679
That's rude.
- No, no.

393
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:26,314
Beauty products can
only enhance the skin.

394
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:28,319
They cannot make you beautiful.

395
00:31:28,401 --> 00:31:29,550
Wow.

396
00:31:29,641 --> 00:31:30,710
A salesman, and yet
you speak the truth?

397
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:32,553
Always. Always.

398
00:31:33,441 --> 00:31:34,590
How many products do you have?

399
00:31:34,681 --> 00:31:36,592
22. 22.

400
00:31:36,681 --> 00:31:37,750
Give six of each.

401
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:39,513
Oh no, no, no. No.

402
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:42,957
All our products expire
in three months. lt dies.

403
00:31:43,761 --> 00:31:44,830
You need only four.

404
00:31:44,921 --> 00:31:46,912
The rest will get spoilt.

405
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:50,155
What did you say the name was?

406
00:31:51,281 --> 00:31:54,034
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products.

407
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,349
Your name?

408
00:31:56,841 --> 00:31:58,115
Rizvan Khan.

409
00:31:58,201 --> 00:31:59,270
Khan.

410
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:03,230
l'm Mandira.
- Mandira.

411
00:32:04,401 --> 00:32:05,754
Hi.
- Hi.

412
00:32:08,281 --> 00:32:09,430
Hi.

413
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:11,589
Hi.

414
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:34,271
lsn't this shocking pink
a little too shocking?

415
00:33:34,361 --> 00:33:36,511
Not at all! lt looks beautiful!

416
00:33:36,601 --> 00:33:37,954
Pink is so your colour.

417
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:39,110
Really?
- Yeah.

418
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:40,316
l agree.

419
00:33:44,681 --> 00:33:47,070
Hello. Hello.

420
00:33:47,161 --> 00:33:49,595
Hi. Nice colour.

421
00:33:49,681 --> 00:33:52,241
Oh yes. Pink is so my colour.

422
00:33:52,681 --> 00:33:54,876
Oh no, no, no. No cell phone.
No cell phone.

423
00:33:54,961 --> 00:33:55,837
Why?

424
00:33:55,921 --> 00:33:57,354
Because bees die due to cell phones.

425
00:33:57,441 --> 00:33:58,351
Who?!

426
00:33:58,441 --> 00:33:59,317
Bees. Bees. Bees.

427
00:33:59,401 --> 00:34:02,996
Cell phone signals cause bees to
lose their way home, and they die.

428
00:34:03,081 --> 00:34:04,514
They die. They die.

429
00:34:04,601 --> 00:34:05,590
lt's not good.

430
00:34:05,681 --> 00:34:06,909
Because Albert Einstein has said..

431
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:08,912
Albert Einstein has apparently said.

432
00:34:09,001 --> 00:34:09,638
Apparently said..

433
00:34:09,721 --> 00:34:11,871
That if all the bees
in the world die..

434
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:13,872
..exactly four years
after that all men will die.

435
00:34:13,961 --> 00:34:14,837
That's right. That's right.

436
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:17,116
All men die. All men die.

437
00:34:17,201 --> 00:34:20,477
Oh no. No cell phones then. lf all
the men die, what will happen to me?

438
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:22,119
You're bad.

439
00:34:22,201 --> 00:34:25,955
This cream has an extra
care skin nourishing lotion..

440
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:29,272
..which contains Aloe Vera,
Calamine and Jojoba oil..

441
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:33,400
..which restore the
pH scale of the skin.

442
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:38,239
The pH is an algorithm of
the activity of hydrogen ions..

443
00:34:38,321 --> 00:34:39,834
..in a solution..

444
00:34:39,921 --> 00:34:42,355
..which tells you how
acidic or basic it is.

445
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:44,511
The exponentials of
hydrogen ions being very high..

446
00:34:44,601 --> 00:34:46,000
..it's not practical to measure it.

447
00:34:46,081 --> 00:34:50,518
lt's not an absolute term,
it's just a relative.

448
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:57,797
Basically it means..
this cream is very nice.

449
00:34:58,441 --> 00:35:00,193
Okay.
- Okay.

450
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:05,034
l'll take it.
- Okay.

451
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:57,954
l trained for a year and then
took a further course in LA.

452
00:35:58,041 --> 00:35:59,952
l mean.. But l did want to make it.

453
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:01,599
l think training is really important.

454
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:02,955
How can you cut
somebody's hair without it?

455
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,360
And that's how l came here.

456
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:05,556
You?

457
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:07,552
Were you saying something to me?

458
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:09,958
And l think you know the most
we know the most we can do is..

459
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:12,271
..just texturise it a
little bit, thin it out. And..

460
00:36:12,361 --> 00:36:14,556
Even l want to have my
hair cut by you, Mandira.

461
00:36:15,281 --> 00:36:17,272
Yeah. l know, Rizvan. But..

462
00:36:17,361 --> 00:36:19,716
Please, please. Please
cut my hair. Please.

463
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:21,154
Yeah. And l am dying
to cut your hair.

464
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:23,675
No, no, no, no. Don't die.
- But maybe later?

465
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:25,433
No, don't die.
Just cut my hair now.

466
00:36:25,521 --> 00:36:27,432
Rizvan..
- No, now.

467
00:37:04,481 --> 00:37:06,312
So? How is it?

468
00:37:08,121 --> 00:37:09,520
Marry me.

469
00:37:10,481 --> 00:37:12,153
Marry me.

470
00:37:12,321 --> 00:37:13,754
Liked it so much?!

471
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:15,669
Hang on. One second.

472
00:37:15,761 --> 00:37:16,830
Marry me.
- Excuse me.

473
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:18,240
Hello?

474
00:37:18,761 --> 00:37:20,194
Sameer. Hi.

475
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:21,111
Reached home?

476
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:22,793
Okay. Okay, l'm coming.

477
00:37:22,881 --> 00:37:24,519
Bye. Love you.

478
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:27,314
Sameer?

479
00:37:29,001 --> 00:37:31,515
Sameer! Sameer! Sam!

480
00:37:31,601 --> 00:37:33,751
Come on. Please, hurry up.
- Coming!

481
00:37:35,241 --> 00:37:37,516
Quickly. Come on! Come on! Come on!

482
00:37:37,601 --> 00:37:39,512
You put everything into the bag?
- Yup.

483
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:41,273
Summer camp project?
- Yup.

484
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:42,760
Lunch.
- Yup.

485
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:44,069
Soccer gear?

486
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,435
l think l forgot.

487
00:37:45,521 --> 00:37:48,399
Mom, stop acting. You
forgot deliberately.

488
00:37:48,481 --> 00:37:49,914
Do you have to play soccer?
lt's dangerous.

489
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,070
What if you get hurt playing?

490
00:37:51,161 --> 00:37:52,514
What if l get hurt
running this way with you?

491
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:53,670
Nothing will happen to you here.

492
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:55,558
l'm here. Your Mom!

493
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:56,756
Mom, stop being so dramatic.

494
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,194
You are such a drama queen.

495
00:37:58,281 --> 00:37:59,600
Yeah, l am.

496
00:37:59,681 --> 00:38:03,356
Okay. Almost there.
Almost there. Almost there.

497
00:38:03,441 --> 00:38:04,271
Thank God. We are on time.

498
00:38:04,361 --> 00:38:05,840
Okay. Bye, Mom.

499
00:38:06,441 --> 00:38:07,920
Where's my hug? Where's my kiss?

500
00:38:08,001 --> 00:38:09,753
Stop it, Mom. l have got reputation.

501
00:38:09,841 --> 00:38:10,910
Reputation.

502
00:38:11,001 --> 00:38:12,400
Bye!
- Bye!

503
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:15,757
Bye! The apple of my eye.
Love me till l die..

504
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,110
Bye!

505
00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:21,631
Oh God. Oh shit.

506
00:38:27,161 --> 00:38:28,560
Hey, Rizvan. Hi.

507
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:30,757
Hi. Any sales appointment?

508
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,035
You are divorced.

509
00:38:32,121 --> 00:38:33,236
Divorced.

510
00:38:33,321 --> 00:38:35,152
Rita told me you are divorced.

511
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:38,438
You were 19 when you
had an arranged marriage.

512
00:38:38,521 --> 00:38:40,000
You came to America
with your husband.

513
00:38:40,081 --> 00:38:41,275
He harassed you a
lot for three years..

514
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,192
..and then left for
Australia with another woman.

515
00:38:43,281 --> 00:38:45,954
lt must take a long time to
run till Australia, right?

516
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:48,677
He divorced you from there and
didn't even pay you alimony.

517
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:51,833
Such a beast! Slimy! ldiot!

518
00:38:51,921 --> 00:38:53,354
He hasn't called you even
once in the last four years.

519
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:55,159
Hasn't even spoken to Sam.

520
00:38:55,241 --> 00:38:56,754
Now, where is he going
to come back..

521
00:38:56,841 --> 00:38:58,274
Slimy bastard, mother..

522
00:38:58,441 --> 00:38:59,635
Mother..

523
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,832
..l can't say the next word.

524
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,279
You have said enough.

525
00:39:05,441 --> 00:39:07,079
Thank you.
- Welcome.

526
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,440
Marry me.
- Just go.

527
00:39:11,521 --> 00:39:13,239
Marry me.
- Just go, okay?

528
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:14,390
Marry me.

529
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:24,515
Okay.

530
00:39:27,921 --> 00:39:28,990
Mandira..
- No, Rita.

531
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:30,275
No more appointments tomorrow!

532
00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:32,272
Mrs. V is coming tomorrow and
her hair colouring takes time.

533
00:39:32,361 --> 00:39:33,510
Okay. Bye.

534
00:39:35,921 --> 00:39:37,639
Bye.
- Bye, girl.

535
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:48,759
Rizvan, are you okay?

536
00:39:51,001 --> 00:39:54,357
No!
- What? Rizvan!

537
00:39:54,681 --> 00:39:55,830
Please..
- No..

538
00:39:56,921 --> 00:39:58,832
What happened?!

539
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:11,270
Hi.

540
00:40:11,641 --> 00:40:12,756
You run fast.

541
00:40:12,841 --> 00:40:18,313
l don't like yellow.

542
00:40:18,481 --> 00:40:19,709
Okay.
- No.

543
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:21,270
ls that for me?

544
00:40:21,361 --> 00:40:23,158
Yes. This and this.

545
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:25,110
But l won't give it to you.

546
00:40:25,201 --> 00:40:25,838
Why?!
- No.

547
00:40:25,921 --> 00:40:27,513
l love balloons.
- No, no, no, no.

548
00:40:27,601 --> 00:40:29,239
ln fact, Sam loves balloons.
- No.

549
00:40:29,321 --> 00:40:31,755
Whenever he sees them, he
wants to set them free in the sky.

550
00:40:31,841 --> 00:40:35,550
Red, blue, pink, green..
these colours look good on you.

551
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,509
Yellow, yellow, dirty fellow.

552
00:40:38,601 --> 00:40:39,716
Yellow, yellow, dirty fellow.

553
00:40:39,801 --> 00:40:40,870
Okay.
- Okay.

554
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:42,360
Sorry.
- Sorry.

555
00:40:43,081 --> 00:40:45,390
Can we go now?
- Okay. - lt's cold.

556
00:40:45,481 --> 00:40:47,551
Okay?
- Okay.

557
00:40:47,841 --> 00:40:49,035
Let's go.

558
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:53,030
Look. l'm sorry l was angry.

559
00:40:53,521 --> 00:40:57,480
Your words reminded me of
all that l wanted to forget.

560
00:40:57,561 --> 00:40:59,358
He really was a..

561
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:01,593
..beast. Slimy. ldiot.
- Yeah.

562
00:41:01,681 --> 00:41:03,911
Slimy. ldiot and all that.

563
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:06,072
So, you don't love him?

564
00:41:06,241 --> 00:41:08,630
No. No, no. Of course not.

565
00:41:08,761 --> 00:41:13,198
Not that, but l feel bad that
Sam will never know his father.

566
00:41:13,281 --> 00:41:14,839
lf you don't love him, marry me.

567
00:41:16,681 --> 00:41:18,080
Marriage is not a joke.

568
00:41:18,161 --> 00:41:19,480
You know. You don't even know me.

569
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:20,835
l know you well.

570
00:41:20,921 --> 00:41:22,593
You give fruit to
Roger the homeless.

571
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:24,831
You cut hair. You do
good deeds. You are good.

572
00:41:24,921 --> 00:41:26,274
You're okay. - Knowing
just that is not good enough.

573
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:27,077
Yes. Yes. lt's enough for me.

574
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:27,593
Marry me.

575
00:41:27,681 --> 00:41:30,434
lt's.. - Marry me. - Oh,
God. l want to kill myself.

576
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,273
Marry me. - l'm fed up.. - Oh, no,
no, no, no, no. Don't kill yourself.

577
00:41:32,361 --> 00:41:33,635
Oh, no, don't kill yourself.

578
00:41:33,721 --> 00:41:36,030
Don't die. Please, don't die.
- l'm joking.

579
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:38,032
Please don't die.
- l was joking. - Please don't die.

580
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,679
Relax, l'm joking.
- Please don't die.

581
00:41:39,761 --> 00:41:40,830
l don't understand..

582
00:41:40,921 --> 00:41:42,149
Mandira. Mandira.
- l was joking..

583
00:41:42,241 --> 00:41:43,435
Cable car. 1873.

584
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:47,309
The first cable car was
started in San Francisco in 1873.

585
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:51,476
1873. - You know you're ridiculous.
You're just ridiculous.

586
00:41:51,881 --> 00:41:52,472
l mean..

587
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:54,711
Either you are stuck in the
'marry me, marry me' loop..

588
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:57,395
..or you keep recounting
the history of San Francisco.

589
00:41:57,761 --> 00:41:59,274
l don't want to know. Okay?

590
00:41:59,361 --> 00:42:01,033
l know everything about this city.

591
00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:02,600
Liar. Liar.

592
00:42:02,681 --> 00:42:04,751
lt's impossible to know
everything about a city.

593
00:42:04,841 --> 00:42:05,591
l've tried.
- Really?

594
00:42:05,681 --> 00:42:07,000
Liar. Liar.

595
00:42:07,081 --> 00:42:08,275
Are you challenging me?
- Bum on fire.

596
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:09,350
Liar. Liar. - Are you
challenging me? - Bum on fire.

597
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:10,840
Okay. You're on.
- l'm on.

598
00:42:10,921 --> 00:42:11,956
You're on.
- Liar. Liar..

599
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:15,829
lf you can show me one
place or thing in this city..

600
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:18,879
..that l haven't seen before then..
- You'll marry me.

601
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,430
You'll marry me.
- Whatever.

602
00:42:22,521 --> 00:42:23,271
Whatever.
- Okay. Okay.

603
00:42:23,361 --> 00:42:24,191
You'll marry me.

604
00:42:24,281 --> 00:42:25,430
But till then..

605
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:26,840
..you will shut your encyclopedia.
- Okay.

606
00:42:26,921 --> 00:42:27,910
And no 'marry me, marry me'.
- Okay.

607
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:29,514
Okay.
- Okay. Whatever.

608
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:31,080
You'll marry me.

609
00:42:31,961 --> 00:42:36,193
And you're right.. the first cable
car came to San Francisco in 1873.

610
00:42:36,281 --> 00:42:37,475
Yeah.

611
00:42:37,561 --> 00:42:40,678
And in the same year, the
first tram was started in Kolkata.

612
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:41,671
Did you know that?

613
00:42:41,761 --> 00:42:43,353
No. You're smart.

614
00:42:43,481 --> 00:42:44,357
That l am.

615
00:42:44,441 --> 00:42:46,750
And pretty.
- That too.

616
00:42:46,841 --> 00:42:48,752
l'm pretty smart too.

617
00:42:49,721 --> 00:42:51,279
Mom. Come on.

618
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:52,555
Coming. One minute, Sam.

619
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:53,915
l'll just come back, okay?
- Okay.

620
00:42:54,001 --> 00:42:55,036
Yeah. Let me handle it.

621
00:42:55,121 --> 00:42:57,681
Mrs. V, you are looking beautiful.
- You are the best.

622
00:42:57,761 --> 00:43:00,275
But you make me come
too far for my hair.

623
00:43:00,361 --> 00:43:03,671
Please accept my offer
and move to Banville.

624
00:43:03,761 --> 00:43:05,752
You are very generous,
Mrs. V, but l..

625
00:43:05,841 --> 00:43:08,196
Shh about that.
Sara, you tell her.

626
00:43:08,281 --> 00:43:09,680
You should move, Mandira.

627
00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:11,592
We'll be neighbours.
lt will be fun.

628
00:43:11,801 --> 00:43:13,996
Mrs. V, l just don't know..
- Mom, come on.

629
00:43:14,081 --> 00:43:15,196
Okay. l am just coming back.

630
00:43:15,281 --> 00:43:17,237
Give me a minute. Sam..
- Don't worry, Granny. She'll move.

631
00:43:17,321 --> 00:43:18,640
God, he's driving me crazy.
- Mom!

632
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:19,597
Yes. Yes. What is it?

633
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:21,080
Mom. Come on.
- Where?

634
00:43:21,241 --> 00:43:23,709
You forgot? Discovery museum.

635
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,757
Oh, my God. l'm so sorry.
Sam, l forgot.

636
00:43:25,841 --> 00:43:26,830
Not fair.
- l remember.

637
00:43:26,921 --> 00:43:28,036
You always forget.

638
00:43:28,121 --> 00:43:29,474
Mandira. Mandira,
l have made a list of places..

639
00:43:29,561 --> 00:43:31,040
All my friends have been there!

640
00:43:31,121 --> 00:43:32,270
..which you may not have seen..
- Even l want to go. Let's go now!

641
00:43:32,361 --> 00:43:33,430
No, l don't care.
- Just.. Just..

642
00:43:33,521 --> 00:43:34,636
..then we can do what you
have asked me not to speak about.

643
00:43:34,721 --> 00:43:35,790
Let's go now! Now! Now!

644
00:43:35,881 --> 00:43:36,950
Sam, Just..

645
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:38,235
lt's just 22 minutes away from here.
We can take a cable car..

646
00:43:38,321 --> 00:43:39,390
Just.. Just.. Just shut up.

647
00:43:39,481 --> 00:43:40,596
One minute.

648
00:43:40,681 --> 00:43:41,830
Just give me a minute, okay?

649
00:43:41,921 --> 00:43:42,990
This list can wait.

650
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:44,355
First, you have to
do something for me.

651
00:43:44,441 --> 00:43:46,113
Will you take Sam
to Discovery museum?

652
00:43:46,201 --> 00:43:47,350
No.
- Please.

653
00:43:47,441 --> 00:43:48,999

Oh, no, no, no, no.

Okay. Okay.

Okay, l'll take him.

660
00:43:57,321 --> 00:43:58,879
Let's go, Sam.

661
00:43:58,961 --> 00:44:00,838
Let's go, Sam.
- Okay.

662
00:44:00,921 --> 00:44:02,673
Look after him and
don't let go of the hand.

663
00:44:02,761 --> 00:44:04,513
Okay?
- Okay.

664
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:07,801
Not mine. His hand.

665
00:44:08,761 --> 00:44:10,592
Please, please, don't kill yourself.

666
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,990
Sam, where's your hand?

667
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:15,510
What are you doing?

668
00:44:15,601 --> 00:44:17,592
Mom said not to let go of your hand.

669
00:44:17,801 --> 00:44:19,280
Mom is mad!

670
00:44:19,361 --> 00:44:20,237
No touching, okay?

671
00:44:20,321 --> 00:44:21,276
No touching?
- Get it?

672
00:44:21,361 --> 00:44:23,670
Okay. Okay. No touching.

673
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:24,671
l like that. No touching.

674
00:44:24,761 --> 00:44:26,194
Okay, everybody knows how to play.

675
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:28,511
We have Team A. Hello. Welcome.

676
00:44:28,601 --> 00:44:30,592
And Team B. Good luck.

677
00:44:30,681 --> 00:44:33,479
But now we need one
more team. We need Team C.

678
00:44:33,561 --> 00:44:35,517
Now who's going to be Team C?

679
00:44:35,681 --> 00:44:36,750
What game is this?

680
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,718
Can't you see? lt's a puzzle.

681
00:44:38,881 --> 00:44:40,837
This grid has names of
animals hidden in it.

682
00:44:40,921 --> 00:44:46,314
The team that identifies the maximum
number of animals wins a prize.

683
00:44:46,401 --> 00:44:47,629
Team C, anybody?

684
00:44:47,721 --> 00:44:50,554
Last time Mom and l played, we lost.

685
00:44:50,641 --> 00:44:51,994
Stupid game.

686
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:55,278
Who's brave enough to
try to win the prize?

687
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:13,269
Mom is mad!

688
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:16,956
Who wants to volunteer to be
Team C and win this fabulous prize?

689
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:19,595
Oh terrific. We have a volunteer.

690
00:45:19,681 --> 00:45:22,673
Okay, just step forward and
we'll get started with the game.

691
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:26,151
What are you doing? No, no, no,
it's embarrassing. - No touching.

692
00:45:26,241 --> 00:45:26,957
Please! We'll lose.
- No touching.

693
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:27,837
No..

704
00:46:04,521 --> 00:46:06,637
Let's hear it for Team C.

705
00:46:08,841 --> 00:46:10,638
Mom! Mom! We won.

706
00:46:11,321 --> 00:46:13,960
Oh wow. Hugging, my son?
That's special.

707
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:14,871
What did you win?

708
00:46:14,961 --> 00:46:17,270
Here! We won because of Khan.

709
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:20,831
Oh no, no, no, no.
My name is not Khan, its Khan.

710
00:46:20,921 --> 00:46:22,400
That's what l said.. Khan.

711
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:27,151
No, not Khan. From the epiglottis,
Khan. Khan.

712
00:46:28,241 --> 00:46:33,440
From the epiglottis.
Epiglottis. Khan.

713
00:46:33,521 --> 00:46:35,512
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Time out. Time out.

714
00:46:35,601 --> 00:46:36,795
Time out.
- Khan.

715
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:38,109
Okay? Okay?
- Khan.

716
00:46:38,241 --> 00:46:41,836
ls there any other place
you want to show me, Khan?

717
00:46:41,921 --> 00:46:43,036
Yeah.

718
00:46:47,161 --> 00:46:48,560
Been here.

719
00:46:49,841 --> 00:46:51,035
Seen this.

720
00:46:52,001 --> 00:46:53,434
Bowed here.

721
00:46:53,721 --> 00:46:55,757
Fell in there.
- l know.

722
00:46:55,841 --> 00:46:56,910
Then why are we here?

723
00:46:57,001 --> 00:46:58,434
Sam wanted to feed the ducks.

724
00:46:58,521 --> 00:47:00,910
Oh, yeah Khan, Khan come
on let's go feed the ducks.

725
00:47:01,001 --> 00:47:03,561
Come on! You want to hold my hands.
- Okay.

726
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:16,520
You know, Khan.
- l don't know.

727
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:19,240
l was 22 when l divorced.

728
00:47:19,321 --> 00:47:21,630
l was only 22 years old.
- 22.

729
00:47:22,401 --> 00:47:23,959
l had nothing.

730
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,115
No money.

731
00:47:26,361 --> 00:47:28,317
No parental support.

732
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:31,430
l didn't even have a house.

733
00:47:31,521 --> 00:47:32,749
Okay.

734
00:47:33,401 --> 00:47:35,437
l had only Sam with me.

735
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:39,435
l didn't know what the
future had in store.

736
00:47:40,601 --> 00:47:43,240
One day, as l was thinking,
l started walking.

737
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:48,352
l walked a lot and
stopped after reaching here.

738
00:47:51,601 --> 00:47:52,954
There was no way ahead.

739
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:54,679
Yeah, only water.

740
00:47:54,761 --> 00:47:56,399
So, l turned back.

741
00:47:58,641 --> 00:48:01,394
Saw the entire city in front of me.

742
00:48:02,561 --> 00:48:06,873
And for a minute, l felt
it was waiting for me.

743
00:48:07,601 --> 00:48:09,557
l decided then..

744
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:14,314
No, l'm going to make this work.

745
00:48:14,761 --> 00:48:16,319
And l'm going to win.

746
00:48:16,841 --> 00:48:18,240
We shall overcome.

747
00:48:18,321 --> 00:48:19,276
We shall overcome?

748
00:48:19,361 --> 00:48:21,431
Yes! We shall overcome.

749
00:48:21,521 --> 00:48:23,000
lt's my favourite song.

750
00:48:23,121 --> 00:48:27,592
We shall overcome.
We shall overcome.

751
00:48:27,681 --> 00:48:31,993
We shall overcome. One day.

752
00:48:32,081 --> 00:48:40,750
The heart believes in it.
That we shall overcome one day.

753
00:48:40,841 --> 00:48:42,672
Oh, no, no, no, no.

754
00:48:42,761 --> 00:48:44,240
You sing badly.

755
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:45,470
You suck. You suck.
- What?!

756
00:48:45,561 --> 00:48:48,075
What?! As if you are any better!

757
00:48:58,961 --> 00:49:00,519
You are staring at me.

758
00:49:00,601 --> 00:49:01,875
You are staring.

759
00:49:02,121 --> 00:49:03,600
You are staring.
- Okay.

760
00:49:03,681 --> 00:49:04,796
Okay.

761
00:49:05,761 --> 00:49:08,753
Sam and l are moving
to Banville next month.

762
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:10,156
Banville.

763
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:13,080
l'm opening my own salon there.

764
00:49:13,161 --> 00:49:14,276
Banvile, California.

765
00:49:14,361 --> 00:49:16,716
Population 30,000.
- Yes.

766
00:49:16,801 --> 00:49:18,871
Take me with you, Mandira.

767
00:49:19,241 --> 00:49:20,754
l'm thin, l won't need much space.

768
00:49:20,841 --> 00:49:21,910
l'll keep an eye on Sam.

769
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,434
l'll never let go of his hand.

770
00:49:23,521 --> 00:49:25,557
Dishwasher, microwave,
washing machine, refrigerator..

771
00:49:25,641 --> 00:49:27,120
..l'll repair everything.

772
00:49:27,201 --> 00:49:28,873
Dishwasher, microwave oven,
washing machine..

773
00:49:28,961 --> 00:49:30,792
..refrigerator
l'll repair everything.

774
00:49:30,881 --> 00:49:31,711
Please take me with you.
- Khan.

775
00:49:31,801 --> 00:49:33,029
No, no. Please take me with you.

776
00:49:33,121 --> 00:49:34,759
Khan, we are getting late.
We have to go.

777
00:49:34,841 --> 00:49:35,956
No, no please take me with you

778
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:39,954
Khan, we are getting late.
We have to go. - Okay, okay

779
00:49:40,921 --> 00:49:43,719
And by the way,
l have been here before.

780
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:49,152
Come on.
- Okay.

781
00:49:49,761 --> 00:49:53,197
Many things frighten me, Mandira.

782
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:57,797
But nothing frightens me more
than the thought of losing you.

783
00:50:06,761 --> 00:50:09,036
l was scared then..

784
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:12,279
..and l'm scared now.

785
00:50:24,081 --> 00:50:26,151
We're full, partner, no room.

786
00:50:26,241 --> 00:50:29,278
Okay.. is there any
other motel nearby?

787
00:50:29,361 --> 00:50:32,080
Oh, you are an lndian.
l'll make some adjustments.

788
00:50:32,161 --> 00:50:35,153
You know, it's a Saturday.

789
00:50:35,321 --> 00:50:38,154
So, all the honeymoon
couples have booked my rooms.

790
00:50:38,241 --> 00:50:39,310
Saturday?

791
00:50:39,401 --> 00:50:41,835
Why? Do they marry
only on Saturdays here?

792
00:50:42,001 --> 00:50:46,756
The one-night marriages..
try and understand.

793
00:50:46,841 --> 00:50:47,751
But you don't worry.

794
00:50:47,841 --> 00:50:49,274
You can stay in my room.

795
00:50:49,361 --> 00:50:51,113
lt has a nude channel too!

796
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:52,520
Nude channel?

797
00:50:52,601 --> 00:50:55,195
The naughty and noisy channel.

798
00:50:55,281 --> 00:50:57,795
Naughty? Noisy?

799
00:50:58,561 --> 00:50:59,755
Down. Down!

800
00:50:59,841 --> 00:51:02,116
You fool. You idiot!

801
00:51:02,201 --> 00:51:05,193
l'll burn that fair
skin of yours, you idiot!

802
00:51:06,801 --> 00:51:08,757
Rascal! Rascal!

803
00:51:08,841 --> 00:51:11,150
All this is because
of the lousy Muslims.

804
00:51:11,241 --> 00:51:13,277
Six years ago, they blew
up the World Trade Centre..

805
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,158
..and today, we bear
the brunt of it.

806
00:51:15,241 --> 00:51:18,278
They call for jihad (holy war) and
we have to suffer the consequences.

807
00:51:18,361 --> 00:51:22,036
And these white folk?
All blind donkeys!

808
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:24,351
Can't you make out the difference
between a Gandhian lndian..

809
00:51:24,441 --> 00:51:27,831
..and a violent Muslim?

810
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:29,559
Should l show you?!

811
00:51:29,761 --> 00:51:33,071
l'm going to put a board
out here: No Muslims Allowed!

812
00:51:33,281 --> 00:51:35,636
This is the fourth
glass broken by the rogues!

813
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:40,556
Don't worry, Brother. Come here.
lt's dangerous out there.

814
00:51:40,641 --> 00:51:44,111
Listen.. come back!
What's your name?

815
00:51:45,241 --> 00:51:48,313
My name is Khan, and
l'm not a terrorist.

816
00:51:54,841 --> 00:51:56,433
Thank you.

817
00:52:01,681 --> 00:52:03,399
l miss you Mandira.

818
00:52:03,761 --> 00:52:07,993
l know l can't return
before meeting the President.

819
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:12,518
l couldn't meet him in Washington,
so, now l'm going to Santa Fe.

820
00:52:12,761 --> 00:52:15,878
One can achieve
everything by trying, Mandira.

821
00:52:16,121 --> 00:52:19,591
Like l found that place. That day.

822
00:52:25,321 --> 00:52:27,073
Yes, l'm coming, coming.

823
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:29,154
Khan, thank God.

824
00:52:29,241 --> 00:52:30,151
Where were you all these days?

825
00:52:30,241 --> 00:52:31,276
l was so worried about you.

826
00:52:31,361 --> 00:52:32,589
You could have called.

827
00:52:32,681 --> 00:52:34,160
But no, you won't.

828
00:52:34,241 --> 00:52:36,357
Cell phones are bad for bees.
- Now.

829
00:52:36,441 --> 00:52:37,669
What?

830
00:52:38,761 --> 00:52:41,036
But wait. Tell me
where we are going?

831
00:52:41,121 --> 00:52:44,033
l am not dressed properly.
l don't even have my shoes.

832
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:56,594
Here. lt's close.

833
00:52:56,681 --> 00:52:58,000
Where?

834
00:53:09,441 --> 00:53:11,193
What do you mean one minute?

835
00:53:11,681 --> 00:53:12,875
One minute.

836
00:53:12,961 --> 00:53:14,917
Keep quiet, Mandira. Quiet.
- Okay.

837
00:53:15,001 --> 00:53:16,992
Quiet, Mandira. Quiet, quiet.
- Okay.

838
00:53:17,081 --> 00:53:18,799
Quiet.
- Okay.

839
00:53:19,241 --> 00:53:21,311
l have been timing it for six days.

840
00:53:21,401 --> 00:53:22,117
One minute.

841
00:53:22,201 --> 00:53:22,713
Close your eyes.

842
00:53:22,801 --> 00:53:24,120
Close your eyes.
- Okay.

843
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,111
Now, now, now, now.
- Okay.

844
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:26,680
Close your eyes. Okay.

845
00:53:26,761 --> 00:53:31,152
Okay, okay, okay, okay

846
00:53:38,321 --> 00:53:39,800
Now, open your eyes.

847
00:53:39,881 --> 00:53:40,950
Open your eyes.

848
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:42,997
Open now. Now, now.

849
00:53:43,081 --> 00:53:44,833
Now, please.

850
00:54:01,921 --> 00:54:05,391
Have you seen this before?

851
00:54:12,921 --> 00:54:14,400
No.

852
00:54:20,801 --> 00:54:22,120
Khan.
- Okay.

853
00:54:23,681 --> 00:54:24,955
Marry me.

854
00:54:33,921 --> 00:54:35,320
Marry me.

855
00:54:37,801 --> 00:54:40,873
Okay.
- Marry me.

856
00:54:45,721 --> 00:54:48,679
You cannot marry her.
lt's blasphemy!

857
00:54:49,401 --> 00:54:52,677
And if you do, l will
sever all ties with you.

858
00:54:52,761 --> 00:54:55,036
You will have no place in my house.

859
00:54:56,521 --> 00:54:58,239
She is a Hindu.

860
00:54:58,321 --> 00:55:00,835
There's a lot of difference between
them and us, understood?

861
00:55:04,361 --> 00:55:07,034
No. There's no difference.

862
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:11,873
Good people.. bad people.
There's no other difference.

863
00:55:22,441 --> 00:55:23,794
Mandira.

864
00:55:24,881 --> 00:55:26,314
Welcome.

865
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:30,440
So, after your marriage,
will my name be Sameer Khan?

866
00:55:31,001 --> 00:55:34,311
lt will be Sameer Khan,
from the epiglottis.

867
00:58:01,361 --> 00:58:02,840
Khan.
- Yeah.

868
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:07,190
We can't do this without touching.

869
00:58:07,281 --> 00:58:08,430
l know.
- You know.

870
00:58:08,521 --> 00:58:09,556
Yeah.

871
00:58:09,641 --> 00:58:12,519
l have read it in this book.

872
00:58:12,721 --> 00:58:16,430
lntercourse for dumbos,
by Dr. Richard k. Woomer.

873
00:58:17,121 --> 00:58:19,840
Okay.
- Nice pictures.

874
00:58:23,761 --> 00:58:24,989
l think we should do it.

875
00:58:25,081 --> 00:58:31,236
Now, now we should do it now.
- One minute, and..

876
00:58:31,321 --> 00:58:32,959
Oh, no, no not one minute.

877
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:34,315
Yeah.

878
00:58:34,401 --> 00:58:36,710
lt will take longer than one minute.

879
00:59:17,281 --> 00:59:18,953
Bye, Khan.
- Bye, Sam.

880
00:59:19,281 --> 00:59:22,079
Lunch. Lunch. Lunch. Lunch. Lunch.
- Quick, quick.

881
00:59:22,161 --> 00:59:22,911
Bye, Joe.

882
00:59:23,001 --> 00:59:25,515
Bye! The apple of my eye!

883
00:59:45,121 --> 00:59:46,998
And your hair looks
very pretty, ma'am.

884
00:59:47,081 --> 00:59:50,118
Thank you, sweetheart.
- You're welcome, sweetheart.

885
00:59:50,641 --> 00:59:52,632
Were you flirting with her?

886
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:57,112
You're not a liar.
- Okay.

887
00:59:57,201 --> 00:59:59,510
Reese, l've to do my homework.
Let me go home.

888
00:59:59,601 --> 01:00:01,193
Just 10 minutes, okay.
- Only 10 minutes.

889
01:00:01,281 --> 01:00:02,350
Alright.

890
01:00:02,681 --> 01:00:06,230
Surprise.

891
01:00:08,281 --> 01:00:09,839
Thank you, Daddy.

892
01:00:10,121 --> 01:00:12,396
Daddy? What about me?

893
01:00:12,601 --> 01:00:17,152
Happy birthday to you.

894
01:00:19,561 --> 01:00:25,033
Mandira. Mandira, can we
have sex please. - Now?

895
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:27,159
Now, now is good.

896
01:00:42,001 --> 01:00:46,552
With Allah's blessings,
l fulfilled my promise to Ammi.

897
01:00:46,921 --> 01:00:50,755
l made a happy life for myself.

898
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:05,353
Hello.

899
01:01:06,681 --> 01:01:07,830
Yes, Sarah.

900
01:01:10,241 --> 01:01:11,560
What?

901
01:01:12,841 --> 01:01:14,513
Khan, switch on the TV, please.

902
01:01:14,601 --> 01:01:16,478
Yes, Sarah let me
call you back, okay.

903
01:01:18,001 --> 01:01:20,561
l've never seen
anything like this before..

904
01:01:21,361 --> 01:01:23,079
Oh, my God!

905
01:01:23,521 --> 01:01:28,117
A second plane.. a second
plane just hit the other tower.

906
01:01:28,201 --> 01:01:32,752
The skyline of Manhattan
has been changed forever.

907
01:01:32,961 --> 01:01:35,873
New York's twin towers are gone.

908
01:01:40,601 --> 01:01:42,637
Both towers have been hit.

909
01:01:42,721 --> 01:01:46,555
lt must've been
a coordinated attack..

910
01:02:16,721 --> 01:02:20,077
Mom, why are Reese and Mrs. Garrick
taking money from everyone?

911
01:02:20,161 --> 01:02:21,355
Donations, baby.

912
01:02:21,441 --> 01:02:25,832
For the family of the fire-fighters
who died saving people during 9/11 .

913
01:02:26,841 --> 01:02:28,797
Hi.
- Hi.

914
01:02:28,881 --> 01:02:30,712
How is it going?
- Good, good.

915
01:02:30,801 --> 01:02:32,598
The Johnson's just
gave a thousand dollars.

916
01:02:32,681 --> 01:02:33,830
Wow.

917
01:02:34,081 --> 01:02:35,150
Thank you.

918
01:02:35,241 --> 01:02:36,230
Oh, God.
- Here.

919
01:02:36,321 --> 01:02:38,073
3500 dollars.

920
01:02:38,161 --> 01:02:40,391
lt's annual Zakat
(religious tax ) money.

921
01:02:40,481 --> 01:02:42,392
lt's a duty in lslam.
Duty, duty, duty.

922
01:02:42,521 --> 01:02:44,591
ln lslam they donate a certain
percentage of their..

923
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:46,592
..income each year in charity.
- Yes.

924
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:48,273
This year, how could
it be anything else?

925
01:02:48,361 --> 01:02:53,913
Yes, that's $3502
and 50 cents exactly.

926
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:54,435
ln the western world, history
is marked simply by BC and AD.

927
01:03:54,921 --> 01:03:59,358
But now, there is a
third distinction. 9/11 .

928
01:04:04,161 --> 01:04:07,039
Reports are in from
various parts of America that..

929
01:04:07,121 --> 01:04:10,636
..Muslims are being
targeted and attacked.

930
01:04:12,441 --> 01:04:13,999
Back off.

931
01:04:14,481 --> 01:04:15,834
Get away.

932
01:04:15,921 --> 01:04:18,879
A Sikh employee in Michigan
was shot dead by his employer..

933
01:04:18,961 --> 01:04:22,078
..because he was
mistaken for an Afghani.

934
01:04:22,161 --> 01:04:25,039
ln the wake of 9/11 , a lot of
American Muslims are changing..

935
01:04:25,121 --> 01:04:28,033
..their names to escape
racial profiling.

936
01:04:28,121 --> 01:04:30,954
Questions are being raised
about America's biased views..

937
01:04:31,041 --> 01:04:33,111
..towards the lslamic community.

938
01:04:33,201 --> 01:04:36,796
Even as Muslim women wearing
hijabs (veils) are being targeted.

939
01:04:36,881 --> 01:04:43,229
Post 9/11 , America's view
towards its lslamic inhabitants..

940
01:04:43,321 --> 01:04:44,470
..is changing rapidly.

941
01:04:48,041 --> 01:04:49,793
They must be getting late.

942
01:04:49,881 --> 01:04:51,599
Let's mom drop you today.

943
01:04:51,681 --> 01:04:53,558
And we'll grab an
ice-cream on the way. - Yeah.

944
01:04:53,641 --> 01:04:54,835
Come on.

945
01:04:55,161 --> 01:04:56,640
Of all the religions in the world..

946
01:04:56,721 --> 01:04:59,394
..lslam is the most violent
and aggressive.

947
01:04:59,481 --> 01:05:04,350
lt encourages killing or 'Jihad'
as they call it, in the name of God.

948
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:28,990
Sam, you need to tell your
mom about this. - No, Reese.

949
01:05:29,361 --> 01:05:31,921
l think she already has
too much to worry about.

950
01:05:53,801 --> 01:05:55,951
Get out of my country.

951
01:06:12,361 --> 01:06:16,559
Don't wear this now.

952
01:06:22,721 --> 01:06:26,270
Allah will understand.
These people won't.

953
01:06:29,681 --> 01:06:31,160
Never.

954
01:06:37,601 --> 01:06:38,795
Yes?

955
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:42,957
l'm Mandira. l heard
about Hasina, so..

956
01:06:45,721 --> 01:06:48,918
She is upstairs,
bhabi (sister-in-law).

957
01:06:55,401 --> 01:06:57,232
He won't come in.

958
01:07:15,601 --> 01:07:21,551
Bhai, please come in. Please.

959
01:07:39,201 --> 01:07:42,238
You are my good son, aren't you?

960
01:07:44,121 --> 01:07:46,316
You are my good son, aren't you?

961
01:07:48,841 --> 01:07:52,629
Alright, Mandira,
you'll join us on Monday.

962
01:07:53,681 --> 01:07:55,080
Thank you so much.

963
01:07:55,921 --> 01:07:58,355
l just want to clarify one thing.

964
01:07:58,801 --> 01:08:02,237
My last name is Khan,
my husband is Muslim.

965
01:08:03,721 --> 01:08:08,112
We'll see you on Monday.
- Thanks.

966
01:08:12,161 --> 01:08:15,756
Khan. l got the job, l got the job.
- Okay.

967
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:16,876
l got the job.
- Okay.

968
01:08:16,961 --> 01:08:17,996
Now, everything will be all right.

969
01:08:18,081 --> 01:08:19,150
We'll do it. We'll do it.
- l know.

970
01:08:19,241 --> 01:08:19,991
We'll do it.
- We'll do it.

971
01:08:20,081 --> 01:08:20,672
Yes, yes, yes.

972
01:08:20,761 --> 01:08:23,559
We shall overcome?

973
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:28,078
We shall overcome.
We shall overcome.

974
01:08:28,161 --> 01:08:29,514
You suck.

975
01:08:29,601 --> 01:08:32,035
You suck. Please don't sing.

976
01:08:33,641 --> 01:08:38,920
We shall overcome. l know,
Mandira, we will..

977
01:08:40,641 --> 01:08:46,716
l'm in Santa Fe, New Mexico,
to meet the President.

978
01:08:49,521 --> 01:08:51,796
His motorcade has 12 cars..

979
01:08:51,881 --> 01:08:58,150
..but no one tells me
which car the President is in.

980
01:09:09,921 --> 01:09:16,076
Mandira, l don't know why, but l
keep failing to meet the President.

981
01:09:16,161 --> 01:09:18,629
But l know l have to meet him.

982
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:21,793
l have to tell him about Sam.

983
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:27,519
Sam. Khan.

984
01:09:27,601 --> 01:09:29,353
So there you guys are.

985
01:09:29,441 --> 01:09:31,318
So, how was your day?

986
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:32,959
Again Xbox?

987
01:09:33,841 --> 01:09:35,991
Make place for me,
make place for me.

988
01:09:36,081 --> 01:09:38,231
Don't hug me mom.
- Come here, sweety.

989
01:09:38,321 --> 01:09:39,356
Don't hug me.

990
01:09:39,601 --> 01:09:43,435
And how are you sweetheart? - No,
no don't hug me, don't hug me, no.

991
01:09:47,881 --> 01:09:49,758
Phone.

992
01:09:49,841 --> 01:09:51,593
But l'll be back.
- Why?

993
01:09:51,841 --> 01:09:53,718
Because you've no choice.

994
01:09:55,921 --> 01:09:58,515
Hello. Hey Sarah.

995
01:10:06,561 --> 01:10:09,394
Reese, pass Mrs. Khan the salad.

996
01:10:10,521 --> 01:10:12,591
Sam, you okay?
- Yeah, l'm fine.

997
01:10:12,681 --> 01:10:14,990
Sarah, we are fine.

998
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:19,280
l'm fine.

999
01:10:22,081 --> 01:10:23,116
Rizvan, how is the chicken?

1000
01:10:23,201 --> 01:10:26,477
Do you like it?
- No, not at all.

1001
01:10:29,561 --> 01:10:32,121
Did l.. did l say a joke?

1002
01:10:32,641 --> 01:10:34,074
Yes you did, Rizvan.

1003
01:10:34,161 --> 01:10:37,631
And a very good one indeed.
- Thank you Mark.

1004
01:10:37,841 --> 01:10:39,797
But the chicken is not good.

1005
01:10:40,561 --> 01:10:44,190
lt's a new recipe. l..
- Don't make it ever again.

1006
01:10:45,881 --> 01:10:49,476
Mark was going to cover the
war in Afghanistan, Mandira.

1007
01:10:50,641 --> 01:10:52,233
Ammi was right.

1008
01:10:52,321 --> 01:10:54,357
Families are not just made by blood.

1009
01:10:54,441 --> 01:10:56,159
They are made with love too.

1010
01:10:56,241 --> 01:11:00,757
Sarah, Mark and Reese had
become a part of our world.

1011
01:11:00,921 --> 01:11:04,800
But l never told them that..

1012
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:07,272
l should have told them.

1013
01:11:31,521 --> 01:11:33,159
Take care, buddy.

1014
01:11:35,561 --> 01:11:38,075
See you, Reese.
- Take care, Reese.

1015
01:11:40,681 --> 01:11:42,160
Hey, Reese.

1016
01:11:58,841 --> 01:12:03,835
ln chapter five, verse 32 of the
Quran, Allah has decreed that..

1017
01:12:04,081 --> 01:12:10,793
..the death of one innocent is
equal to the death of humanity.

1018
01:12:21,321 --> 01:12:30,036
l knew that the death of innocents in
9/11 would cost the entire humanity.

1019
01:12:30,441 --> 01:12:34,957
But l did not know that you
and l would have to pay..

1020
01:12:35,041 --> 01:12:36,952
..the biggest price, Mandira.

1021
01:12:37,801 --> 01:12:42,272
Why did this happen
to us, Mandira? Why?

1022
01:12:50,584 --> 01:12:53,337
Reese. Just talk to me man.

1023
01:12:53,424 --> 01:12:55,892
Wait a minute. Why are
you ignoring me, Reese?

1024
01:12:55,984 --> 01:12:57,337
lts been so many days since..

1025
01:12:57,424 --> 01:12:59,938
Reese, listen to me. Wait a minute.

1026
01:13:00,424 --> 01:13:02,460
Please listen to me man.

1027
01:13:02,624 --> 01:13:04,819
What's the problem?
What have l done?

1028
01:13:04,904 --> 01:13:06,576
Reese, just listen to me.
- Piss off.

1029
01:13:06,664 --> 01:13:07,858
Listen to me.

1030
01:13:14,584 --> 01:13:17,018

1038
01:13:39,544 --> 01:13:40,897
Hey.

1039

l'm sorry. l shouldn't have yelled.
- Yes, very loud.

1040
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:48,576
Very, very loud. Not nice, not nice.
- Khan.

1041
01:13:48,664 --> 01:13:50,382
Khan, please don't be angry with me.

1042
01:13:50,464 --> 01:13:52,182
l don't have any
friends apart from you.

1043
01:13:52,264 --> 01:13:54,300
Liar. Liar.

1044
01:13:54,384 --> 01:13:55,499
Reese is your friend.

1045
01:13:55,584 --> 01:13:56,699
He's your friend.
- Right.

1046
01:13:56,784 --> 01:13:58,900
You're a liar. He's your friend.

1047
01:13:58,984 --> 01:14:00,940
Cool shoes.
- Thank you.

1048
01:14:01,024 --> 01:14:02,537
Can l try them?
- No.

1049
01:14:02,624 --> 01:14:04,774
Please.
- No, please.

1050
01:14:05,224 --> 01:14:06,942
Want to play?
- No.

1051
01:14:07,024 --> 01:14:08,093
l'll beat you.

Do you have to play soccer?

1068
01:14:48,064 --> 01:14:49,258
Do you have to cut hair?

1069
01:14:49,344 --> 01:14:50,572
Very clever.

1070
01:14:50,664 --> 01:14:54,054
The apple of my eye!
Love me till l die!

1071
01:14:55,944 --> 01:14:58,504
Sam. Sam.

1072
01:14:58,824 --> 01:15:00,940
Why is Sam walking so strangely?

1073
01:15:02,544 --> 01:15:04,136
Why are you laughing so strangely?

1074
01:15:04,224 --> 01:15:06,977
You're too cute.
- No, no.

1075
01:15:07,064 --> 01:15:09,020
You're too cute.

November 27, 2007. 8:23 am.

the last time l heard you laugh.

1081
01:15:26,344 --> 01:15:29,177
Reese. Reese.

1082
01:15:29,464 --> 01:15:30,692
Reese, you haven't
spoken in eight days now.

1083
01:15:30,784 --> 01:15:32,012
What's up?
- Just leave me alone.

1084
01:15:32,104 --> 01:15:33,981
What's with you? You
know l loved your dad.

1085
01:15:34,064 --> 01:15:35,782
Just.. don't talk about my dad.

1086
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,980
Come on, Reese, we're best friends.
Our moms are best friends.

1087
01:15:38,064 --> 01:15:40,055
You know what you people
are nobody's best friends.

1088
01:15:40,144 --> 01:15:42,339
All you people care is about
your damn 'Jihad' or whatever.

1089
01:15:42,424 --> 01:15:43,698
What are you talking about man?

1090
01:15:43,784 --> 01:15:45,502
Reese, just listen to me.
- Just go away.

1091
01:15:45,584 --> 01:15:47,495
No, Reese, you listen..
- Shut up, and go! - Listen.

1092
01:15:47,584 --> 01:15:50,417
Sameer, l said go away.
- Listen to me man.

1093
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:51,698
Just go away.

1094
01:15:51,784 --> 01:15:52,853
Look at those two little brats.

1095
01:15:52,944 --> 01:15:55,777
Hey, ladies, come on
time out. Come on.

1096
01:15:55,864 --> 01:15:57,138
Didn't you hear him?

1097
01:15:57,224 --> 01:15:58,577
He said ''Leave him alone''.

1098
01:15:58,664 --> 01:16:00,416
So why don't you go
home to your mummy.

1099
01:16:00,504 --> 01:16:03,177
Stay out of it.
- What?

1100
01:16:03,264 --> 01:16:04,902
l said, stay out of it.
- What did you say?

1101
01:16:04,984 --> 01:16:06,975
You heard me, stay out of it.

1102
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:09,577
Jim, let him go.
- What's the matter?

1103
01:16:09,664 --> 01:16:11,177
Don't you care about your dead dad?
- Yeah, but..

1104
01:16:11,264 --> 01:16:13,824
ls Osama your lover?
- Let him go.

1105
01:16:13,904 --> 01:16:15,496
So.. dead.

1106
01:16:19,944 --> 01:16:21,980
Stop it guys, you're hurting him.

1107
01:16:22,904 --> 01:16:24,656
Oh, he liked that one.

1108
01:16:27,344 --> 01:16:29,255
What did he just do.

1109
01:16:29,344 --> 01:16:31,016
Let's get him guys.

1110
01:16:37,344 --> 01:16:39,255
Hey, Osama's son.

1111
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:40,857
Bloody Paki.

1112
01:16:49,344 --> 01:16:50,902
Get away.

1113
01:16:51,224 --> 01:16:52,782
Get away.

1114
01:17:18,584 --> 01:17:22,463
Screw you assholes
- What did you say?

1115
01:17:22,784 --> 01:17:24,297
Screw you.

1116
01:17:45,224 --> 01:17:47,613
Sameer. Come on buddy, get up.

1117
01:17:47,704 --> 01:17:48,898
Sameer.

1118
01:17:48,984 --> 01:17:50,576
Sameer, come on.

1119
01:17:50,664 --> 01:17:53,497
Sameer. Sameer.

1120
01:17:53,584 --> 01:17:55,939
Oh, shit.
- Come on.

1121
01:17:56,024 --> 01:17:57,343
This didn't happen, okay.

1122
01:17:57,424 --> 01:18:00,302
This didn't happen
this didn't happen.

1123
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:01,863
Or else..

1124
01:18:01,944 --> 01:18:03,696
Do you hear me?

1125
01:18:28,824 --> 01:18:30,052
Mrs. Khan. l'm detective Garcia.

1126
01:18:30,144 --> 01:18:32,214
l need to ask you some
questions about this?

1127
01:18:32,304 --> 01:18:33,896
Later.
- Let's get him into the ER.

1128
01:18:33,984 --> 01:18:37,056
ls the trauma team ready?
- Yes, they are..

1129
01:18:37,144 --> 01:18:39,135
Lip discoloration..
discolouration of the face.

1130
01:18:39,224 --> 01:18:40,543
How is his pulse?
- Rapid pulse.

1131
01:18:40,624 --> 01:18:43,696
Possible internal bleeding.
Possible spleen rupture.

1132
01:18:43,784 --> 01:18:46,173
What's going on?
- We got to do this fast, you guys.

1133
01:18:46,264 --> 01:18:48,494
He's losing blood. l think
we got to give him blood.

1134
01:18:48,584 --> 01:18:50,461
We got to do this fast.

1135
01:18:51,104 --> 01:18:52,776
Spleen rupture.

1136
01:18:53,264 --> 01:18:57,860
Spleen rupture. Spleen rupture.
Spleen rupture.

1137
01:18:59,424 --> 01:19:01,176
Go, go, go.

1138
01:19:01,504 --> 01:19:03,779
Ma'am, you need to stay out.

1139
01:19:06,704 --> 01:19:08,103
Okay, what've we got here,
what've we got?

1140
01:19:08,184 --> 01:19:09,503
No signs of internal bleeding.

1141
01:19:10,504 --> 01:19:11,573
Give me vitals.

1142
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:13,382
Heart is throbbing extremely low.
- Okay.

1143
01:19:13,464 --> 01:19:15,853
Okay, defib now.
- He's technicardiac.

1144
01:19:15,944 --> 01:19:18,014
Give me the defib.
- Ready for defib.

1145
01:19:18,104 --> 01:19:19,457
Okay, we're going to shock in 200.

1146
01:19:19,544 --> 01:19:21,023
Ready now.

1147
01:19:21,384 --> 01:19:22,578
Clear.

1148
01:19:23,264 --> 01:19:24,492
200.

1149
01:19:24,584 --> 01:19:30,420
One, two, three.. clear.
- Still no pulse.

1150
01:19:31,104 --> 01:19:32,332
Okay go to 300.

1151
01:19:32,424 --> 01:19:33,698
Clear.

1152
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:36,935
Still no pulse, doctor.

1153
01:19:43,144 --> 01:19:44,941
We lost him.

1154
01:19:45,024 --> 01:19:47,413
Time of death, 8:05 pm.

1155
01:20:06,904 --> 01:20:08,496
Sam.

1156
01:20:13,904 --> 01:20:15,257
Ruptured spleen.. spleen.

1157
01:20:15,344 --> 01:20:17,983
lt's the only part of
the human body..

1158
01:20:18,064 --> 01:20:20,259
..the use of which is
not known to doctors.

1159
01:20:20,504 --> 01:20:22,654
When the capsule
containing the spleen is ruptured..

1160
01:20:22,744 --> 01:20:25,622
..a splenectomy is performed,
and the spleen is removed.

1161
01:20:25,704 --> 01:20:31,700
But that can lead to
pneumococcal infection.

1162
01:20:31,784 --> 01:20:33,536
He's dead.

1163
01:20:35,544 --> 01:20:37,023
He's dead.

1164
01:20:42,184 --> 01:20:44,095
The splenic.. artery is clamped.

1165
01:20:44,184 --> 01:20:46,140
Time of death, 8:05 pm.

1166
01:20:49,504 --> 01:20:53,133
Time of death, 8:05 pm.

1167
01:20:56,544 --> 01:21:00,423
Time of death, 8:05 pm.

1168
01:21:48,144 --> 01:21:49,463
Sam.

1169
01:21:53,104 --> 01:21:54,981
Come back to me.

1170
01:21:57,704 --> 01:21:59,342
Come back to me, baby.

1171
01:22:03,544 --> 01:22:05,535
Come back to me, baby.

1172
01:22:09,704 --> 01:22:11,376
Don't leave me.

1173
01:22:13,304 --> 01:22:15,659
Don't leave me, please.

1174
01:22:19,704 --> 01:22:24,539
Come back to me please.
Please come back. Please.

1175
01:22:30,824 --> 01:22:33,816
Come back to me, Sam.

1176
01:22:34,424 --> 01:22:37,143
Sam, come back.

1177
01:22:37,904 --> 01:22:40,338
Don't leave me.

1178
01:23:06,504 --> 01:23:08,096
l apologise for the late hour.

1179
01:23:08,184 --> 01:23:12,018
But 48 hours is our best window
to catch the attackers. - Yeah.

1180
01:23:12,104 --> 01:23:14,743
Now, l've gone through the
medical examiner's reports.

1181
01:23:14,824 --> 01:23:17,258
The attack on your son
seems very personal Mrs. Khan.

1182
01:23:17,344 --> 01:23:19,653
lt happened at the
community soccer field.

1183
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:24,413
lnspector Garcia told us
that our Sam's death..

1184
01:23:24,504 --> 01:23:26,699
..may have been a racial attack.

1185
01:23:26,784 --> 01:23:30,459
His wounds were proof of that.

1186
01:23:30,744 --> 01:23:33,702
He was a Muslim, so he was killed.

1187
01:23:33,784 --> 01:23:36,696
But l couldn't understand.

1188
01:23:36,904 --> 01:23:40,943
Being a Muslim is not
a bad thing, Mandira.

1189
01:24:03,064 --> 01:24:04,497
Sam.

1190
01:24:05,904 --> 01:24:07,098
My baby.

1191
01:24:07,184 --> 01:24:08,333
Mandira..

1192
01:24:08,424 --> 01:24:09,698
We killed him.

1193
01:24:09,784 --> 01:24:10,853
Mandira..

1194
01:24:10,944 --> 01:24:12,775
We killed him.

1195
01:24:13,264 --> 01:24:14,617
We killed him.

1196
01:24:14,704 --> 01:24:15,819
Mandira..

1197
01:24:15,904 --> 01:24:17,781
Let's go home.

1198
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:21,853
We killed him.

1199
01:24:21,944 --> 01:24:23,377
lt's time for dinner.

1200
01:24:23,464 --> 01:24:24,863
Doctors say that post-traumatic
disorder causes people..

1201
01:24:24,944 --> 01:24:26,013
..to ignore their health.

1202
01:24:26,104 --> 01:24:28,857
Both of us killed him. - You need
to take care of your health.

1203
01:24:29,104 --> 01:24:30,583
Just shut up, just shut up.

1204
01:24:30,664 --> 01:24:31,892
Are you listening to
what l am saying?

1205
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:34,737
We killed him!

1206
01:24:36,384 --> 01:24:38,295
lt's all my fault.

1207
01:24:38,384 --> 01:24:40,261
lt's all my fault.

1208
01:24:40,904 --> 01:24:42,974
lf l hadn't married you..

1209
01:24:43,424 --> 01:24:45,096
..all this wouldn't have happened.

1210
01:24:46,424 --> 01:24:50,702
l thought you loved me so much.

1211
01:24:50,904 --> 01:24:52,462
Loved Sam so much.

1212
01:24:52,704 --> 01:24:54,217
What difference would it make..

1213
01:24:54,784 --> 01:24:56,661
..if his name is changed?

1214
01:24:57,064 --> 01:24:58,543
What difference would it make..

1215
01:24:58,624 --> 01:25:00,774
..if a 'Khan' was
added to his name?

1216
01:25:01,944 --> 01:25:03,696
But l was wrong.

1217
01:25:03,784 --> 01:25:05,422
lt makes a difference.

1218
01:25:06,064 --> 01:25:07,656
lt does make a difference.

1219
01:25:07,824 --> 01:25:10,384
l should never have
married a Muslim man!

1220
01:25:11,224 --> 01:25:14,182
lf Sam had been a Rathod (Hindu),
he would have been alive today.

1221
01:25:14,264 --> 01:25:15,982
He was a Khan, so, he died.

1222
01:25:16,064 --> 01:25:19,136
He died because of you.
Because of your surname!

1223
01:25:20,384 --> 01:25:22,534
l don't understand
what you are saying.

1224
01:25:23,064 --> 01:25:25,862
l don't understand what you
are saying. You are not well.

1225
01:25:25,944 --> 01:25:27,343
God.

1226
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:29,984
l want to die.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1227
01:25:30,064 --> 01:25:31,258
l want to die.

1228
01:25:31,344 --> 01:25:35,132
No, no, no Mandira
please don't die.

1229
01:25:35,224 --> 01:25:37,374
No, no, please don't die.

1230
01:25:37,464 --> 01:25:38,783
You can't die.

1231
01:25:38,864 --> 01:25:39,933
Please don't die.

1232
01:25:40,024 --> 01:25:42,697
Just leave me alone, please.

1233
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:44,536
Leave me please.

1234
01:25:44,624 --> 01:25:46,580
l don't even want to see you.

1235
01:25:46,664 --> 01:25:48,097
Whenever l see you..

1236
01:25:48,184 --> 01:25:51,017
..l remember Sam's wounds.

1237
01:25:52,344 --> 01:25:54,016
l can't do this.

1238
01:25:55,304 --> 01:25:57,056
l can't do this anymore.

1239
01:25:57,544 --> 01:25:59,136
l'm leaving you, Khan.

1240
01:25:59,224 --> 01:26:01,419
l'm leaving you!

1241
01:26:01,504 --> 01:26:02,903
Why should you leave?

1242
01:26:02,984 --> 01:26:04,702
The house is yours. l will leave.

1243
01:26:04,784 --> 01:26:07,457
Go right now! This instant!

1244
01:26:08,024 --> 01:26:09,503
Go right now.

1245
01:26:09,584 --> 01:26:13,657
Go! Go!

1246
01:26:21,064 --> 01:26:22,702
Mandira..

1247
01:26:25,544 --> 01:26:27,375
When should l come back?

1248
01:26:28,664 --> 01:26:30,382
When should you be back?

1249
01:26:31,784 --> 01:26:33,456
When should you be back?

1250
01:26:34,704 --> 01:26:36,695
You know Banville?

1251
01:26:36,904 --> 01:26:38,940
lt has a population of 30,000.

1252
01:26:39,304 --> 01:26:43,456
And each one of those
30,000 people hates you.

1253
01:26:43,544 --> 01:26:45,933
Tell all of them that
you are not a terrorist.

1254
01:26:46,024 --> 01:26:47,742
Why only them?

1255
01:26:47,824 --> 01:26:51,578
Tell every person in America.

1256
01:26:52,864 --> 01:26:55,662
Can you do that? Can you?

1257
01:26:56,024 --> 01:26:57,252
No, you can't.

1258
01:26:57,344 --> 01:27:00,495
Why don't you tell the
President of United States then?

1259
01:27:00,704 --> 01:27:05,539
Mr. President, my name is
Khan and l'm not a terrorist.

1260
01:27:06,264 --> 01:27:08,380
So, he can tell all these people..

1261
01:27:08,664 --> 01:27:12,339
..that my Sam was not the terrorist
son of a terrorist father.

1262
01:27:12,704 --> 01:27:14,774
He was just a baby.

1263
01:27:15,944 --> 01:27:17,775
My baby.

1264
01:27:20,984 --> 01:27:22,861
When you do that..

1265
01:27:24,064 --> 01:27:25,736
..come back.

1266
01:27:26,824 --> 01:27:28,576
Come back then!

1267
01:27:36,824 --> 01:27:40,976
Mr. President, my name is
Khan and l'm not a terrorist.

1268
01:27:41,064 --> 01:27:44,454
Mr. President, my name is
Khan and l'm not a terrorist.

1269
01:27:44,624 --> 01:27:49,015
Mr. President, my name is
Khan and l'm not a terrorist.

1270
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:53,093
My name is Khan and
l'm not a terrorist.

1271
01:27:53,424 --> 01:27:56,143
My name is Khan and
l'm not a terrorist.

1272
01:27:56,224 --> 01:27:58,021
Not a terrorist.

1273
01:29:06,184 --> 01:29:08,573
Mandira, l felt a stab
of pain in my chest..

1274
01:29:08,664 --> 01:29:10,894
..when l left you.

1275
01:29:10,984 --> 01:29:13,134
l thought it was chest congestion.

1276
01:29:13,744 --> 01:29:18,738
But no amount of ginger juice
could make the pain go away.

1277
01:29:19,144 --> 01:29:20,782
lt's still there.

1278
01:33:06,144 --> 01:33:10,535
Bhabhi, whatever you
said then was said in anger.

1279
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:13,173
lt was Sam's grief
that made you say it.

1280
01:33:13,544 --> 01:33:16,342
We all know you love him a lot.

1281
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:19,655
Then why don't you.. - There is no
space for love in my life right now.

1282
01:33:20,024 --> 01:33:22,174
Love will weaken me.

1283
01:33:22,424 --> 01:33:24,779
Hate will help me fight this battle.

1284
01:33:25,224 --> 01:33:27,294
And l have to fight for Sam.

1285
01:33:27,984 --> 01:33:30,418
l can't be Khan's wife right now.

1286
01:33:31,304 --> 01:33:34,694
l'm just a mother
whose son has been killed.

1287
01:33:46,184 --> 01:33:49,096
l've had a long day, and
l've sold enough tickets.

1288
01:33:49,984 --> 01:33:52,452
l'll have to call you back, alright.

1289
01:33:54,984 --> 01:33:58,215
For dinner with the
president is $500 you know.

1290
01:34:02,584 --> 01:34:05,223
That's.. that's 500.

1291
01:34:07,624 --> 01:34:10,900
What church are you from?
- Church? Church?

1292
01:34:11,464 --> 01:34:13,853
This is a Christian's only event.

1293
01:34:13,944 --> 01:34:18,574
But.. but it says, it's a fund
raiser for the draught in Africa.

1294
01:34:18,904 --> 01:34:20,417
For Christians, honey.

1295
01:34:20,504 --> 01:34:24,099
Honey, Honey keep it.

1296
01:34:25,504 --> 01:34:27,779
For those are not
Christian in Africa.

1297
01:34:30,344 --> 01:34:33,700
Honey. Honey, feed Africa.

1298
01:34:47,464 --> 01:34:49,375
Offer it to him as well?

1299
01:34:52,624 --> 01:34:55,092
Excuse me, would you
like to have some?

1300
01:35:37,224 --> 01:35:41,422
What's your name?
- Rizvan Khan. Khan.

1301
01:35:41,944 --> 01:35:43,980
l'm lmran and this is Sajida.

1302
01:35:46,504 --> 01:35:47,698
Where are you off to?

1303
01:35:47,784 --> 01:35:49,422
lt's time for the bus to leave.

1304
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:51,381
Prayer time.

1305
01:35:51,464 --> 01:35:52,613
Prayer time?

1306
01:35:52,704 --> 01:35:54,979
Now? Here?

1307
01:35:56,104 --> 01:35:59,938
You should pray depending upon
the place and the people around.

1308
01:36:02,544 --> 01:36:05,820
No. No, no.

1309
01:36:06,864 --> 01:36:09,059
Prayer should never depend
upon the place or the people.

1310
01:36:09,304 --> 01:36:11,260
lt should depend only
on your belief.

1311
01:37:47,424 --> 01:37:48,937
My God, my knee.

1312
01:37:49,024 --> 01:37:51,299
Oh my God, my knee is bleeding.

1313
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:56,618
l'm sorry,
but l can't repair your knee.

1314
01:37:56,784 --> 01:38:00,697
But can you at least help me please.
- Help?

1315
01:38:01,704 --> 01:38:04,138
Oh, yes l can do that.

1316
01:38:04,864 --> 01:38:06,422
Okay, thanks.

1317
01:38:06,624 --> 01:38:08,819
Joel, that better be you.

1318
01:38:11,024 --> 01:38:12,537
Hello.

1319
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:14,502
You are an angel.

1320
01:38:14,584 --> 01:38:15,778
You've saved my baby.

1321
01:38:15,864 --> 01:38:17,820
He could've been out
there lying, bleeding.

1322
01:38:17,904 --> 01:38:19,383
Oh, thank you, thank you.

1323
01:38:19,464 --> 01:38:22,217
You little frisky thing, aren't you?
- Please don't hug me.

1324
01:38:22,304 --> 01:38:24,056
Alright.
- That's my Mama Jenny.

1325
01:38:24,144 --> 01:38:27,181
Always trying to hug everyone.
- Mama Jenny, please don't hug me.

1326
01:38:27,264 --> 01:38:32,861
Joel lzale Williams. l told
you not take that bicycle out.

1327
01:38:32,944 --> 01:38:35,538
Now off to bed with you.
- Yes, ma'am.

1328
01:38:35,624 --> 01:38:38,616
You. You Mr. Repair man.
- Rizvan.

1329
01:38:38,704 --> 01:38:41,696
Rizvan. Oh, you hungry child?
You want little dinner?

1330
01:38:41,784 --> 01:38:44,252
No, l want lots of dinner.

1331
01:38:46,464 --> 01:38:48,420
First we've got to get
you out of those clothes.

1332
01:38:48,504 --> 01:38:51,576
You want me to be naked?
- No, no, no.

1333
01:38:51,664 --> 01:38:53,973
Just get this cleaned up,
that's all.

1334
01:38:54,064 --> 01:38:57,693
Funny hair Joel and his
Mama Jenny are good people.

1335
01:38:57,984 --> 01:39:01,056
Mama Jenny is strict
and a little fat too.

1336
01:39:01,144 --> 01:39:03,180
But l like her.

1337
01:39:13,304 --> 01:39:15,215
Mama Jenny's elder son, James..

1338
01:39:15,304 --> 01:39:18,899
..was killed two
months ago in the lraq war.

1339
01:39:21,944 --> 01:39:24,094
But he loved his country.

1340
01:39:25,984 --> 01:39:29,499
Mama Jenny too asked me
about Sameer.

1341
01:39:30,144 --> 01:39:33,454
Sam has been gone for 1 79 days..

1342
01:39:33,544 --> 01:39:37,219
..and for the first time, someone
made a mention of him to me.

1343
01:39:43,264 --> 01:39:45,016
Poor baby.

1344
01:39:46,384 --> 01:39:48,340
Poor baby

1345
01:39:52,264 --> 01:39:57,782
Mama Jenny and Funny Hair Joel live
in Wilhemina, Tarrow County, Georgia.

1346
01:39:59,704 --> 01:40:05,893
This small town has 204
people and 754 cows exactly.

1347
01:40:09,104 --> 01:40:12,221
All the people here
work at the dairy farm.

1348
01:40:12,304 --> 01:40:15,774
And pray at the Church Of Rock.

1349
01:40:20,064 --> 01:40:25,218
Today, there's a memorial service
for all the soldiers killed in lraq.

1350
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:34,859
Mama Jenny has added Sameer's
name to the list of martyrs.

1351
01:40:37,304 --> 01:40:42,662
Mama Jenny said by
remembering and talking about them..

1352
01:40:42,744 --> 01:40:45,178
..we can get closer to them.

1353
01:40:45,264 --> 01:40:47,300
Letters just stopped.

1354
01:40:48,024 --> 01:40:51,255
My mom's never been the same,
she cries all the time.

1355
01:40:52,464 --> 01:40:54,694
l loved my brother so much,
and l just want him to know..

1356
01:40:54,784 --> 01:40:57,457
..if he's out there,
that l miss him.

1357
01:40:57,704 --> 01:40:58,819
He's always..

1358
01:40:58,904 --> 01:41:04,695
l too tried to get closer to Sam.

1359
01:41:05,704 --> 01:41:08,901
Sameer Rathod Khan, my son.

1360
01:41:09,424 --> 01:41:13,576
Weight 56 kilogram,
blood group O positive.

1361
01:41:13,824 --> 01:41:16,292
Sameer loved Xbox and soccer.

1362
01:41:16,384 --> 01:41:20,741
He loved his soccer shoes so
much that he would sleep in them.

1363
01:41:20,824 --> 01:41:23,258
That was the only bad habit he had.

1364
01:41:23,504 --> 01:41:26,541
Sam was six years old
when l married his mother.

1365
01:41:26,624 --> 01:41:28,740
Sameer was a good son.

1366
01:41:28,824 --> 01:41:33,944
He did not mind sharing
his mom's love with me.

1367
01:41:34,624 --> 01:41:39,334
But l couldn't be
such a good dad to him.

1368
01:41:39,984 --> 01:41:44,933
Other dads sense their children's
unsaid needs and fulfil them.

1369
01:41:45,384 --> 01:41:48,854
But l can't sense
unexpressed feelings.

1370
01:41:49,224 --> 01:41:51,215
So, l couldn't fulfil them.

1371
01:41:52,304 --> 01:41:54,977
But.. but, Sam never complained.

1372
01:41:55,064 --> 01:41:58,101
He never complained.

1373
01:41:59,864 --> 01:42:01,900
Sam had one more bad habit.

1374
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:03,781
He told us only good things.

1375
01:42:03,864 --> 01:42:05,980
He always hid bad news from us.

1376
01:42:07,144 --> 01:42:10,534
He would never tell me when my
favorite team Manchester United lost.

1377
01:42:10,624 --> 01:42:12,137
Never.

1378
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:15,660
Unless we had a bet.
Then he would tell me.

1379
01:42:15,904 --> 01:42:21,183
Then l would l have to give him
his mint chocolate-chip ice cream.

1380
01:42:22,344 --> 01:42:23,823
Two scoops.

1381
01:42:24,864 --> 01:42:26,741
Two scoops, always.

1382
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:31,816
Two scoops.

1383
01:42:32,264 --> 01:42:35,415
On 27th November 2007,
he was killed.

1384
01:42:36,944 --> 01:42:39,617
He was 13 years, nine
months and four days old.

1385
01:42:41,344 --> 01:42:44,734
Sameer was not only my son,
he was my dearest friend.

1386
01:42:45,064 --> 01:42:47,897
Actually, my only friend.

1387
01:42:47,984 --> 01:42:49,337
My..

1388
01:42:49,984 --> 01:42:54,739
My.. only best friend.

1389
01:43:02,424 --> 01:43:06,133
l'm sure Allah is happy that
Sam is with him in heaven.

1390
01:43:06,224 --> 01:43:13,175
l.. Mama Jenny, l
don't know what to say.

1391
01:43:14,824 --> 01:43:18,658
l don't want to say anymore.

1392
01:43:54,224 --> 01:43:55,862
Come on, Rizvan.

1393
01:45:30,584 --> 01:45:31,778
Okay.
- Okay.

1394
01:45:31,864 --> 01:45:33,377
Bye.

1395
01:45:33,464 --> 01:45:36,581
Bye, Rizvan.
- Bye.

1396
01:45:36,664 --> 01:45:37,983
Bye.
- Bye.

1397
01:45:38,064 --> 01:45:40,020
Okay, okay bye.

1398
01:45:40,104 --> 01:45:42,538
God bless you, my son.

1399
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:45,813
What do you mean
you're shutting the case?

1400
01:45:45,904 --> 01:45:47,781
Understand it's been six months.

1401
01:45:47,864 --> 01:45:50,253
Okay, no witnesses, no suspects,
no evidence.

1402
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:52,699
There's been no movement
on this case, Mrs. Khan.

1403
01:45:52,784 --> 01:45:54,297
Look, l really have no choice.

1404
01:45:54,384 --> 01:45:56,534
But you know, maybe.. maybe
there's somebody at school..

1405
01:45:56,624 --> 01:45:57,693
..who will remember something.

1406
01:45:57,784 --> 01:45:59,820
You know, maybe you can go
door to door, class to class.

1407
01:45:59,904 --> 01:46:01,542
Door to door and homes,
and something..

1408
01:46:01,624 --> 01:46:03,933
You know l've done that already.
- But, you know..

1409
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:05,503
Maybe there's something
else that you'll find.

1410
01:46:05,584 --> 01:46:07,256
You see these files?

1411
01:46:07,344 --> 01:46:09,812
These are all those
waiting for justice too.

1412
01:46:10,264 --> 01:46:12,653
Look, l'm sorry,
Mrs. Khan. l truly am.

1413
01:46:12,744 --> 01:46:15,463
Sometimes there really
are no answers. - No.

1414
01:46:16,224 --> 01:46:17,942
l don't accept that.

1415
01:46:18,504 --> 01:46:20,540
l do not accept that.

1416
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:22,660
There has to be an answer.

1417
01:46:24,344 --> 01:46:27,416
And if you can't find it, l will.

1418
01:46:49,824 --> 01:46:51,018
Hi.
- Hi.

1419
01:46:51,104 --> 01:46:53,823
l'm looking for any lead on
the boys who killed my son.

1420
01:46:53,904 --> 01:46:55,178
Any information at all.
My number is there. - Okay.

1421
01:47:09,664 --> 01:47:12,303
l have reached Los Angeles now.

1422
01:47:13,144 --> 01:47:17,103
The President is coming
visit the college campus here.

1423
01:47:21,464 --> 01:47:23,694
l have reached
three days before him..

1424
01:47:23,784 --> 01:47:26,742
..so that l don't miss
him this time around.

1425
01:47:31,584 --> 01:47:34,781
l am going to pray that
Allah wills it so too.

1426
01:47:44,624 --> 01:47:46,979
Listen, listen, listen brothers.

1427
01:47:47,464 --> 01:47:49,341
We are digressing.

1428
01:47:49,864 --> 01:47:51,980
l have said it before.

1429
01:47:52,504 --> 01:47:56,656
l have no problem with
Christians or the Jews.

1430
01:47:57,824 --> 01:48:01,578
ln fact, l have no problems
with our Hindu brothers too.

1431
01:48:02,184 --> 01:48:07,577
l treat a lot of Hindu
patients in St. Benedict's hospital.

1432
01:48:07,984 --> 01:48:11,135
l get angry only
when this same grace..

1433
01:48:11,224 --> 01:48:13,818
..is not
reciprocated towards us Muslims.

1434
01:48:13,904 --> 01:48:16,179
My blood boils..

1435
01:48:16,264 --> 01:48:22,499
..when lsraeli Jews
massacre our Palestinian brothers.

1436
01:48:23,024 --> 01:48:24,582
Or when Hindus in lndia..

1437
01:48:24,664 --> 01:48:27,895
..cut our women and children
to pieces with their swords.

1438
01:48:27,984 --> 01:48:32,296
That's when my blood boils.

1439
01:48:32,584 --> 01:48:35,052
Doesn't your blood boil? Answer me.

1440
01:48:35,144 --> 01:48:36,782
Doesn't your blood boil?
- lt does. lt does.

1441
01:48:36,864 --> 01:48:38,092
lt does. lt does.

1442
01:48:38,184 --> 01:48:41,859
So, do something then. Do something!

1443
01:48:43,104 --> 01:48:47,655
l, Dr. Faisal Rehman,
take an oath that l'm ready.

1444
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:49,018
Are you people ready? Are you?

1445
01:48:49,104 --> 01:48:51,857
Yes, we are. Yes. Yes, we are.

1446
01:48:51,944 --> 01:48:53,297
Are you people ready?

1447
01:48:53,384 --> 01:48:56,740
Yes, we are. Yes. Yes, we are.

1448
01:49:00,184 --> 01:49:06,783
Mighty Allah had even asked
lbrahim to sacrifice his son.

1449
01:49:07,864 --> 01:49:14,178
And without asking a single question,
lbrahim agreed to sacrifice him.

1450
01:49:15,544 --> 01:49:18,581
lt's our turn today.

1451
01:49:18,784 --> 01:49:22,902
lt's our duty to let our blood
flow for the cause of lslam.

1452
01:49:23,104 --> 01:49:25,060
This is what Allah demands!

1453
01:49:25,144 --> 01:49:28,659
This is what lslam demands!

1454
01:49:28,744 --> 01:49:33,181
No, no, no, no.

1455
01:49:33,264 --> 01:49:34,822
No.

1456
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:38,221
You are lying.

1457
01:49:38,424 --> 01:49:40,096
Wait.. Wait..

1458
01:49:40,344 --> 01:49:41,936
Why, brother?

1459
01:49:42,224 --> 01:49:45,182
Don't you believe that the Lord
had asked for lsmail's sacrifice?

1460
01:49:45,264 --> 01:49:47,141
No, no.

1461
01:49:48,264 --> 01:49:49,902
My Ammi has told me the story.

1462
01:49:50,984 --> 01:49:55,023
Saint lbrahim did not doubt
the compassion of the Lord.

1463
01:49:55,464 --> 01:49:56,863
No, no, no. No.

1464
01:49:58,744 --> 01:50:01,781
The story is an example of his
immense strong faith and belief.

1465
01:50:02,424 --> 01:50:04,415
And that's the reason..

1466
01:50:04,904 --> 01:50:08,214
..why despite being incited
by a stranger repeatedly..

1467
01:50:08,624 --> 01:50:11,616
..Saint lbrahim did not waver
from his path of righteousness.

1468
01:50:11,704 --> 01:50:12,773
No.

1469
01:50:12,864 --> 01:50:14,775
He didn't listen to the stranger.

1470
01:50:14,864 --> 01:50:19,221
He was sure Allah would never allow
the blood of his progeny to be shed.

1471
01:50:20,424 --> 01:50:21,937
And he was right.

1472
01:50:22,864 --> 01:50:26,652
The mighty Allah saved
lsmail's life.

1473
01:50:27,504 --> 01:50:31,258
My Ammi also said, ''Rizvan..

1474
01:50:32,624 --> 01:50:38,415
..this story shows that the
path of Allah is that of love..

1475
01:50:38,664 --> 01:50:43,419
..not of hatred and war.''

1476
01:50:45,944 --> 01:50:48,458
You are lying.

1477
01:50:50,344 --> 01:50:51,538
Dr. Faisal Rehman is a liar.
- You are lying.

1478
01:50:51,624 --> 01:50:53,137
Look. The meaning of
the story is clear.

1479
01:50:54,544 --> 01:50:56,262
Dr. Faisal Rehman is a liar.
- Our brother here speaks the truth.

1480
01:50:56,704 --> 01:50:58,103
Allah's path is that of compassion.

1481
01:50:58,384 --> 01:51:00,693
That's why his loved ones are called
'blessed by the compassionate! '

1482
01:51:02,344 --> 01:51:04,016
Dr. Faisal Rehman is a liar.
Ask him who was that stranger?

1483
01:51:04,104 --> 01:51:05,173
l'm not lying!

1484
01:51:05,264 --> 01:51:06,333
You are lying!

1485
01:51:06,424 --> 01:51:08,016
Our times demand..
- Ask him..

1486
01:51:08,104 --> 01:51:10,459
The stranger who tried to
veer lbrahim from his path..

1487
01:51:10,544 --> 01:51:12,102
..was he an infidel?

1488
01:51:12,184 --> 01:51:13,299
How does it matter who he was?

1489
01:51:13,384 --> 01:51:14,612
But Doctor, who was he?

1490
01:51:14,704 --> 01:51:16,535
Listen l can explain everything.

1491
01:51:16,864 --> 01:51:19,901
Brother, tell us who he was.

1492
01:51:26,104 --> 01:51:31,497
Satan! Satan! Satan!

1493
01:51:47,424 --> 01:51:49,380
The world is strange, Mandira.

1494
01:51:49,464 --> 01:51:52,024
The more l try to understand it..

1495
01:51:52,104 --> 01:51:54,538
..the lesser l understand.

1496
01:51:55,344 --> 01:51:57,653
l miss you.

1497
01:52:01,304 --> 01:52:03,101
Hello.
- Hello.

1498
01:52:04,184 --> 01:52:06,778
Bhai.. You? Where are you?

1499
01:52:07,584 --> 01:52:11,099
FBl. Do you have
a number for the FBl?

1500
01:52:11,424 --> 01:52:13,779
FBl? Why?

1501
01:52:40,024 --> 01:52:41,093
Please.

1502
01:52:41,184 --> 01:52:42,742
lt's our college,
and they are pushing us around.

1503
01:52:42,824 --> 01:52:45,213
l wonder why they are so excited.
That too for this President.

1504
01:52:45,304 --> 01:52:47,181
Lousy pods of garlic!

1505
01:52:47,864 --> 01:52:49,138
l love it.

1506
01:52:49,224 --> 01:52:52,022
There are no better cusswords
than lndian ones. - Really.

1507
01:53:03,184 --> 01:53:05,015
Boys and girls.

1508
01:53:05,104 --> 01:53:08,096
Come on. This is the man
you waited for hours to see.

1509
01:53:08,184 --> 01:53:10,618
Let's give him a
warm round of applause.

1510
01:53:10,704 --> 01:53:14,060
l present to you, the man,
the legend.

1511
01:53:14,144 --> 01:53:17,500
The president of the
United States of America.

1512
01:53:18,984 --> 01:53:21,020
Alright, yes.

1513
01:53:25,224 --> 01:53:26,782
Alright, come on everybody.

1514
01:53:26,864 --> 01:53:30,254
Let's give this guy a nice
warm round of applause..

1515
01:53:30,344 --> 01:53:31,618
..for his esteemed support.

1516
01:53:31,704 --> 01:53:33,023
And there he is.

1517
01:53:34,904 --> 01:53:38,055
Alright everybody, alright.

1518
01:53:38,144 --> 01:53:40,738
Everybody, make some noise.

1519
01:53:40,824 --> 01:53:42,337
President.

1520
01:53:44,184 --> 01:53:46,220
Mr. President.

1521
01:53:47,024 --> 01:53:49,174
Mr. President.

1522
01:53:55,344 --> 01:53:57,096
Mr. President.

1523
01:54:00,544 --> 01:54:04,219
My name Khan,
and l'm not a terrorist.

1524
01:54:10,384 --> 01:54:12,136
Mr. President.

1525
01:54:13,424 --> 01:54:16,496
My name Khan,
and l'm not a terrorist.

1526
01:54:17,264 --> 01:54:18,777
Did he just say terrorist?

1527
01:54:18,864 --> 01:54:20,900
l'm not a terrorist.
- Terrorist!

1528
01:54:20,984 --> 01:54:26,741
He says he's a terrorist.
- l'm not a terrorist.

1529
01:54:32,464 --> 01:54:33,977
Move.

1530
01:54:54,944 --> 01:54:56,741
Don't move.

1531
01:54:57,184 --> 01:54:58,617
l got him.

1532
01:55:12,104 --> 01:55:13,583
Don't move, man. Don't move.

1533
01:55:13,664 --> 01:55:16,098
Keep your hands
where l can see them.

1534
01:55:20,984 --> 01:55:24,454
My name is Khan, and
l'm not a terrorist.

1535
01:55:24,704 --> 01:55:26,422
l don't understand.

1536
01:55:26,984 --> 01:55:28,463
He is strange.

1537
01:55:29,264 --> 01:55:31,255
First, he was standing silently.

1538
01:55:31,344 --> 01:55:32,493
Then all of a sudden,
he was screaming.

1539
01:55:32,584 --> 01:55:33,733
And what was he screaming..

1540
01:55:33,824 --> 01:55:37,100
l'm not a terrorist.
l'm not a terrorist. Strange.

1541
01:55:37,184 --> 01:55:38,902
There's something more to his story.

1542
01:55:39,224 --> 01:55:41,579
Yes. But why are
we after this story?

1543
01:55:41,784 --> 01:55:44,014
Listen, Raj. This
can't be our project.

1544
01:55:44,104 --> 01:55:46,823
l don't want to get into
this Khan story. l'm scared.

1545
01:55:46,904 --> 01:55:48,656
Scared because he is a Khan?

1546
01:55:49,504 --> 01:55:51,062
lf he was a Khanna,
you wouldn't be, right?

1547
01:55:51,144 --> 01:55:52,577
What do you mean?

1548
01:55:52,864 --> 01:55:55,014
You know what l'm saying, Komal.

1549
01:55:57,144 --> 01:55:59,374
Listen, this is
going to be my project.

1550
01:55:59,704 --> 01:56:01,296
Are you with me?

1551
01:56:05,784 --> 01:56:08,014
He's been following the
President for some weeks now.

1552
01:56:08,104 --> 01:56:11,494
And we.. frankly can't know
whether he's a 'Jihadi' or not.

1553
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:15,573
l have made a mistake again,
Mandira.

1554
01:56:15,664 --> 01:56:18,542
And now, the
President is angry with me.

1555
01:56:18,624 --> 01:56:21,013
He has even told
the judge about it.

1556
01:56:21,464 --> 01:56:25,582
That's why the judge has
asked me to be shut away.

1557
01:56:36,584 --> 01:56:40,657
He has also ordered that
l should meet a psychiatrist.

1558
01:56:40,944 --> 01:56:44,061
He says he will meet me after that.

1559
01:56:44,424 --> 01:56:48,212
l will tell him then
that l'm not an enemy.

1560
01:56:48,464 --> 01:56:49,943
l'm not evil.

1561
01:56:50,024 --> 01:56:52,982
l am unable to say
anything now, Mandira.

1562
01:56:54,704 --> 01:56:57,172
l'm very scared.

1563
01:57:03,224 --> 01:57:04,577
His name is Rizvan Khan.
- Rizvan Khan. - Yes.

1564
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:07,097
They are not saying
anything beyond that right now.

1565
01:57:07,184 --> 01:57:09,493
l knew the police wasn't
going to tell us anything.. Now?

1566
01:57:09,584 --> 01:57:12,303
Now what? There are
other ways of finding out.

1567
01:57:12,664 --> 01:57:14,336
Come on, let's go.

1568
01:57:15,264 --> 01:57:16,936
Guys, you know this is illegal.

1569
01:57:17,024 --> 01:57:19,333
Yes. And you never do
anything illegal, right?

1570
01:57:19,784 --> 01:57:24,460
Here. Complete
information on Rizvan Khan.

1571
01:57:24,544 --> 01:57:26,102
House, work address,
social security number.

1572
01:57:26,184 --> 01:57:27,333
Credit records, salary statement.

1573
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:28,777
ln short, his entire life!

1574
01:57:28,864 --> 01:57:31,378
Wow, dude, lnder you're a rockstar.
- Yes, thanks.

1575
01:57:31,464 --> 01:57:32,533
Bye.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1576
01:57:32,624 --> 01:57:33,739
Stay out of jail.

1577
01:57:34,424 --> 01:57:35,982
Yeah, l'll call you back. Bye.

1578
01:57:36,064 --> 01:57:38,532
Yeah, l'm telling you, it's a
great piece for your paper, okay.

1579
01:57:38,624 --> 01:57:40,296
This man, Rizvan Khan,
is a simple guy.

1580
01:57:40,384 --> 01:57:42,136
He sells beauty
products for a living.

1581
01:57:42,224 --> 01:57:43,418
Listen.

1582
01:57:43,504 --> 01:57:44,619
He's no enemy combatant.

1583
01:57:44,704 --> 01:57:45,773
That's what you think.

1584
01:57:45,864 --> 01:57:48,617
l just interviewed an extremist
in a Kabul prison last year.

1585
01:57:48,704 --> 01:57:51,741
He was just a tailor.
There's no story here, bud.

1586
01:57:56,384 --> 01:57:58,500
This place is strange, Mandira.

1587
01:57:58,584 --> 01:58:03,135
There are no windows to any room
and the bathrooms don't have a door.

1588
01:58:03,304 --> 01:58:06,455
And the toilet has a lock.

1589
01:58:08,464 --> 01:58:11,979
My eyes burn and l feel sleepy too.

1590
01:58:13,384 --> 01:58:15,773
At times, it's very hot here.

1591
01:58:15,864 --> 01:58:17,855
At other times, it is very cold.

1592
01:58:17,944 --> 01:58:21,937
l told them l would
repair their air conditioner..

1593
01:58:22,304 --> 01:58:24,056
..but they won't let me.

1594
01:58:25,624 --> 01:58:28,377
They don't even tell me
the time so that l can pray.

1595
01:58:28,624 --> 01:58:31,138
That's why every time
l feel scared..

1596
01:58:31,384 --> 01:58:34,342
l bow and pray.

1597
01:58:35,184 --> 01:58:37,652
Oh, sorry guys, sorry.
Give me two minutes, okay.

1598
01:58:37,744 --> 01:58:39,416
Look, l've looked over the details.

1599
01:58:39,504 --> 01:58:40,983
l'm not really interested, but..

1600
01:58:41,064 --> 01:58:42,816
..why don't you try
Bobby Ahuja, at PBC.

1601
01:58:42,904 --> 01:58:45,623
He might able to
help you. Okay. Alright.

1602
01:58:45,824 --> 01:58:48,213
But why? Why do you want
to meet the President?

1603
01:58:48,304 --> 01:58:50,738
Why do you know so
much about the President?

1604
01:58:50,824 --> 01:58:53,133
Why were you reading
up on the President?

1605
01:58:53,464 --> 01:58:55,295
Do you know these people?

1606
01:58:55,384 --> 01:58:57,500
Azhar Mahmood, Omar Khan..

1607
01:58:57,584 --> 01:58:59,779
l think they are angry..

1608
01:58:59,864 --> 01:59:03,618
..because l'm not able to answer
their questions about the Al Qaeda.

1609
01:59:03,704 --> 01:59:06,662
But l don't know
anything about them.

1610
01:59:06,904 --> 01:59:11,102
Mandira, l should have
read up on Al Qaeda before.

1611
01:59:11,184 --> 01:59:13,857
Why? Why were you at
the Rally? Okay, what?

1612
01:59:16,544 --> 01:59:18,535
lt's time for his session with me.

1613
01:59:18,744 --> 01:59:20,700
As ordered by the judge.

1614
01:59:21,264 --> 01:59:25,052
Do you really buy this, ''My wife
told me to meet the President'' shit?''

1615
01:59:25,144 --> 01:59:27,260
Would it matter if l said yes?

1616
01:59:28,624 --> 01:59:29,818
Hello.
- Hi.

1617
01:59:29,904 --> 01:59:32,623
Raj.
- Raj, Bobby Ahuja. Please sit.

1618
01:59:35,864 --> 01:59:38,424
l didn't have your number or l would
have called to tell you that..

1619
01:59:38,504 --> 01:59:42,053
..l can't cover the
Rizvan Khan story.

1620
01:59:42,264 --> 01:59:44,300
l have a busy schedule.

1621
01:59:44,784 --> 01:59:47,014
l have no time for
another two months.

1622
01:59:47,984 --> 01:59:50,782
You know otherwise, you know
l would've done something.

1623
01:59:50,864 --> 01:59:53,332
But.. you know what l mean?

1624
01:59:53,424 --> 01:59:55,654
lf you don't mind me asking, sir.

1625
01:59:56,264 --> 01:59:58,858
Was this photograph
taken before 9/11?

1626
02:00:00,944 --> 02:00:02,821
Yes. Why?

1627
02:00:05,224 --> 02:00:06,373
What's so funny?

1628
02:00:06,464 --> 02:00:10,059
No, it's not funny at all actually.

1629
02:00:11,424 --> 02:00:15,212
They confused a Sikh for a Muslim
and you changed your entire life.

1630
02:00:16,144 --> 02:00:19,056
And here, they are not even
treating a Muslim like a human..

1631
02:00:19,584 --> 02:00:21,415
..and you aren't able
to change your schedule?

1632
02:00:23,864 --> 02:00:25,536
Thank you for your time, sir.

1633
02:00:36,184 --> 02:00:38,493
You have one new message.

1634
02:00:38,584 --> 02:00:41,496
Hi Raj, this is
Bobby Ahuja from PBC.

1635
02:00:41,864 --> 02:00:43,536
Don't forget to
watch the news tomorrow.

1636
02:00:45,064 --> 02:00:47,942
My name is Khan, and
l'm not a terrorist.

1637
02:00:48,024 --> 02:00:49,457
Mr. President.

1638
02:00:49,544 --> 02:00:51,694
Rizvan Khan of Banville
California was arrested..

1639
02:00:51,784 --> 02:00:54,776
..on June 15th at the
CLA Presidential Rally.

1640
02:00:54,864 --> 02:00:56,183
He has been accused
of being a terrorist..

1641
02:00:56,264 --> 02:00:58,095
..and has been jailed
for the last 15 days.

1642
02:00:58,184 --> 02:00:59,503
Without any evidence.

1643
02:00:59,584 --> 02:01:01,700
And without legal representation.

1644
02:01:01,784 --> 02:01:04,742
And today, we have with us Mr.
and Mrs. Zakir Khan.

1645
02:01:04,824 --> 02:01:06,018
Family of Rizvan Khan.

1646
02:01:06,104 --> 02:01:08,982
lmran, the Khan from the bus is
on PBC. Quick, switch on the TV!

1647
02:01:09,064 --> 02:01:11,578
Very angry and very upset.

1648
02:01:12,264 --> 02:01:14,983
l mean, how can anyone
call him a terrorist?

1649
02:01:15,864 --> 02:01:17,456
That too without any evidence.

1650
02:01:17,544 --> 02:01:20,695
Tell them how last month
Bhai called for the FBl.

1651
02:01:21,304 --> 02:01:24,341
Bhai had called last month.
He wanted the number for the FBl.

1652
02:01:24,424 --> 02:01:28,861
He wanted to report some terrorist
recruiter called, Dr. Faisal Rehman.

1653
02:01:29,504 --> 02:01:32,814
Yo, how's business, asshole?

1654
02:01:33,584 --> 02:01:35,381
Fuck you.

1655
02:01:35,504 --> 02:01:38,177
l mean we're told to
report suspicious characters.

1656
02:01:38,264 --> 02:01:41,017
Participate in.. protecting
the country from extremists.

1657
02:01:41,104 --> 02:01:42,696
And then when we do that..

1658
02:01:42,784 --> 02:01:45,139
..we're just put into
the jail, like my brother.

1659
02:01:45,224 --> 02:01:48,341
Yeah, this is judge Preston,
can you give me the FBl please?

1660
02:01:48,904 --> 02:01:51,976
The question over here is, not why
he's trying to meet the President.

1661
02:01:52,144 --> 02:01:54,021
The question is, what's
wrong in an ordinary citizen..

1662
02:01:54,104 --> 02:01:56,254
..wanting to meet the
President of his country?

1663
02:01:56,744 --> 02:02:00,373
Or is it just wrong for
a Muslim man to even try?

1664
02:02:02,584 --> 02:02:05,542
And as Rizvan Khan
continues to be treated as guilty..

1665
02:02:05,624 --> 02:02:10,573
..until proven innocent, for
PBC News, my name is Bobby Ahuja.

1666
02:02:11,024 --> 02:02:12,537
And l'm not a terrorist.

1667
02:02:12,624 --> 02:02:15,092
He is right. Zakir Bhai is right.

1668
02:02:15,464 --> 02:02:19,855
We are told to report to the
government any information..

1669
02:02:19,944 --> 02:02:22,458
..we have on any terrorist activity.

1670
02:02:23,464 --> 02:02:26,661
And when we do that,
what happens is before you.

1671
02:02:27,104 --> 02:02:30,016
Why is this being
asked over and over again?

1672
02:02:30,104 --> 02:02:32,664
''Why does Khan want to
meet the President?''

1673
02:02:33,064 --> 02:02:37,660
What's the harm if an ordinary
citizen wants to meet the President?

1674
02:02:37,744 --> 02:02:39,336
What's wrong?

1675
02:02:39,424 --> 02:02:42,860
Or then tell us clearly that
Muslims don't have right to do so.

1676
02:02:45,584 --> 02:02:47,814
Yes, good afternoon.
This is Tracy Brennan..

1677
02:02:47,904 --> 02:02:50,941
..Chairperson of the American
Autistic society in San Francisco.

1678
02:02:51,184 --> 02:02:53,459
Would you put me on to your
officer in-charge of the..

1679
02:02:53,544 --> 02:02:56,058
..Rizvan Khan case, please?

1680
02:02:56,144 --> 02:02:58,612
This is about the Rizvan Khan case.

1681
02:02:58,704 --> 02:03:01,821
Any information you
have on Rizvan Khan.

1682
02:03:01,904 --> 02:03:03,417
Look l've been calling all morning.

1683
02:03:03,504 --> 02:03:06,780
l need to know where Rizvan
Khan has been taken, please.

1684
02:03:09,944 --> 02:03:11,093
Hello, hello.

1685
02:03:11,184 --> 02:03:12,697
My name is Rizvan Khan.

1686
02:03:12,784 --> 02:03:14,263
Khan, from the epiglottis.

1687
02:03:14,344 --> 02:03:16,414
l want to report a man.

1688
02:03:16,504 --> 02:03:18,301
l have to report a man.

1689
02:03:18,384 --> 02:03:20,181
l met him at a downtown mosque.

1690
02:03:20,264 --> 02:03:22,061
l met him at a downtown mosque.

1691
02:03:22,144 --> 02:03:24,453
His name is Dr. Faisal Rehman.

1692
02:03:24,544 --> 02:03:27,616
Faisal Rehman, he works at
the St. Benedicts Hospital.

1693
02:03:27,704 --> 02:03:29,376
He is a bad man.

1694
02:03:29,464 --> 02:03:31,295
He is a very bad man.

1695
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:36,416
Your call helped
them arrest Dr. Rehman.

1696
02:03:36,704 --> 02:03:39,013
Eight others were arrested with him.

1697
02:03:40,064 --> 02:03:42,214
lt's a big catch, Rizvan.

1698
02:03:42,384 --> 02:03:43,942
You are free to go now.

1699
02:03:44,024 --> 02:03:45,742
You are free.

1700
02:04:03,304 --> 02:04:04,862
Hey, watch it.

1701
02:04:10,824 --> 02:04:13,941
Finally, Rizvan Khan's
innocence has been proved.

1702
02:04:14,144 --> 02:04:16,419
He will be freed in a few moments.

1703
02:04:17,184 --> 02:04:20,096
A small, but increasing group of
supporters have gathered here today..

1704
02:04:20,184 --> 02:04:22,061
..and have shown no
signs of leaving.

1705
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:26,581
Bano, come quickly! Rizvan Khan
has been released. He's been freed.

1706
02:04:33,984 --> 02:04:37,215
Bare Essentials Mystique,

02:04:45,224 --> 02:04:47,215
You some Guru or something?

1710
02:04:47,304 --> 02:04:49,613
Some crazy lady was just
here shouting about your..

1711
02:04:49,704 --> 02:04:52,423
..innocence and what not.
- Crazy lady. Mandira.

1712
02:04:52,504 --> 02:04:54,301
Mandira was here.

1713
02:04:54,384 --> 02:04:56,181
Crazy lady, Mandira was here.

1714
02:04:56,264 --> 02:04:57,697
Where did she go?

1715
02:04:57,784 --> 02:04:58,933
Where did she go?

1716
02:04:59,024 --> 02:05:00,343
Where did she go?

1717
02:05:00,424 --> 02:05:02,813
Where did she go?
- She went out the back way.

1718
02:05:09,984 --> 02:05:11,497
Mandira.

1719
02:05:12,864 --> 02:05:14,502
Mandira.

1720
02:05:20,064 --> 02:05:21,463
Mandira.

1721
02:06:21,744 --> 02:06:24,975
Sorry Mandira, l couldn't meet you..

1722
02:06:25,224 --> 02:06:28,216
..since l haven't
fulfilled my promise to you yet.

1723
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:35,736
But somehow Mandira,
as soon as l saw you..

1724
02:06:35,824 --> 02:06:38,657
..the pain in my chest vanished.

1725
02:06:42,824 --> 02:06:44,496
Where did Rizvan Khan go?

1726
02:06:44,584 --> 02:06:47,735
And why does he want to meet
the President? No one knows.

1727
02:06:47,824 --> 02:06:49,496
So why he wants to
meet the President..

1728
02:06:49,584 --> 02:06:52,735
..and what is his message about
continues to remain a mystery.

1729
02:06:52,824 --> 02:06:55,019
This is Bobby Ahuja, PBC news.
- Yeah, so..

1730
02:06:55,104 --> 02:06:56,696
Thank you so much for
this internship, sir.

1731
02:06:56,784 --> 02:06:58,012
We promise not to let you..

1732
02:06:58,104 --> 02:07:00,413
Thank me later..
First find this Khan..

1733
02:07:00,504 --> 02:07:03,064
His story has moved
thousands of Muslims.

1734
02:07:03,784 --> 02:07:05,695
l wish l knew where Bhai was, Raj.

1735
02:07:05,784 --> 02:07:07,536
He calls me.

1736
02:07:08,224 --> 02:07:11,660
Yeah. Yeah, next time he
calls me l'll let you know.

1737
02:07:15,704 --> 02:07:17,695
Yo, Paki loser.

1738
02:07:26,704 --> 02:07:29,662
Hey! My name is Abdul!

1739
02:07:30,184 --> 02:07:31,617
You want a piece of me.

1740
02:07:33,664 --> 02:07:35,541
You show me the finger?
- Enough, okay buddy.

1741
02:07:35,624 --> 02:07:37,694
Come, l'll show you once
and for all. - l'm done.

1742
02:07:37,784 --> 02:07:39,456
Come l'll show you!

1743
02:07:39,864 --> 02:07:41,377
What you looking at?

1744
02:07:58,744 --> 02:08:03,420
For a while now l have
been fighting with myself.

1745
02:08:03,624 --> 02:08:09,096
l teach you about identity when my
own has been changed so drastically.

1746
02:08:11,064 --> 02:08:14,693
My hijab is not just
my religious identity.

1747
02:08:15,944 --> 02:08:17,900
lt is a part of my existence.

1748
02:08:18,824 --> 02:08:20,701
lt's me.

1749
02:08:22,584 --> 02:08:25,144
Khan stayed in room 22 only.

1750
02:08:25,464 --> 02:08:27,261
You want to stay in the same room?

1751
02:08:27,344 --> 02:08:31,781
Only 25 dollars extra,
to be a part of history.

1752
02:08:32,064 --> 02:08:35,215
And mind you, my name is Jitesh.

1753
02:08:35,424 --> 02:08:37,540
And l'm not a terrorist.

1754
02:08:38,264 --> 02:08:40,903
Mummy, l want to tell
you something today.

1755
02:08:41,344 --> 02:08:43,778
Today l'm proud to
be a computer hacker.

1756
02:08:45,264 --> 02:08:46,743
Ya.. l have eaten already.

1757
02:08:46,824 --> 02:08:48,815
At least listen to
what l'm saying first.

1758
02:08:57,184 --> 02:09:02,861
Hurricane Molly.. now
moving at 125 miles per hour..

1759
02:09:02,944 --> 02:09:04,855
..has severely hit
the southern coast.

1760
02:09:04,944 --> 02:09:07,538
And the authorities around the
southern region have been alerted.

1761
02:09:07,624 --> 02:09:10,218
We now go live to Alex,
who's on location.

1762
02:09:10,304 --> 02:09:11,419
Thank you, Janice.

1763
02:09:11,504 --> 02:09:13,062
Attention all passengers..

1764
02:09:13,144 --> 02:09:16,341
..E- 52 bus to Portland has
been delayed by 10 minutes.

1765
02:09:16,424 --> 02:09:19,336
Again, E-52 Portland bus
has a ten minute delay.

1766
02:09:19,424 --> 02:09:20,903
We regret the inconvenience.

1767
02:09:21,384 --> 02:09:23,102
We have a fresh update,
this just in.

1768
02:09:23,184 --> 02:09:26,017
We've news that the hurricane
has hit Wilhemina, Georgia.

1769
02:09:26,104 --> 02:09:28,572
l repeat, Wilhemina,
Georgia has been hit.

1770
02:09:28,784 --> 02:09:30,934
Full on by hurricane Molly.

1771
02:09:31,264 --> 02:09:34,176
At this point we don't
have any indication as to..

1772
02:09:34,264 --> 02:09:41,215
Mama Jenny.. Mama
Jenny l have to go to her.

1773
02:09:55,184 --> 02:09:58,460
Raj.. Bhai called.. You wanted
to know where he was, didn't you?

1774
02:09:58,544 --> 02:09:59,613
Yes, Zakir bhai?

1775
02:09:59,704 --> 02:10:01,376
He's going to Wilhemina.

1776
02:10:02,904 --> 02:10:05,976
Wilhemina? That's in Georgia, right?

1777
02:10:06,064 --> 02:10:07,622
Ya.. Somewhere there.

1778
02:10:07,704 --> 02:10:08,819
What is he doing there?

1779
02:10:08,904 --> 02:10:11,179
He said that he has to
meet some Mama Jenny there.

1780
02:10:42,224 --> 02:10:46,695
Mandira, there's going to be a
delay in meeting the President.

1781
02:10:47,864 --> 02:10:50,139
l have come to Wilhemina, Georgia.

1782
02:10:50,224 --> 02:10:54,297
Mama Jenny and Funny
hair Joel are in trouble.

1783
02:10:54,504 --> 02:10:57,257
There's too much water here,
Mandira..

1784
02:10:57,344 --> 02:11:01,019
..and l don't think
Mama Jenny can swim.

1785
02:11:01,104 --> 02:11:03,413
She's a little fat.

1786
02:11:57,464 --> 02:12:00,024
Rizvan. Mama Rizvan.

1787
02:12:00,464 --> 02:12:04,218
Rizvan. What are you doing here?

1788
02:12:04,504 --> 02:12:10,818
Mama Jenny, l'm happy, Funny
hair Joel and you are not dead.

1789
02:12:10,904 --> 02:12:12,974
l'm happy.

1790
02:12:15,144 --> 02:12:17,658
Thank you for coming, Rizvan.

1791
02:12:17,744 --> 02:12:20,133
But you should not be here.
- l'm happy, l'm here.

1792
02:12:20,224 --> 02:12:22,215
No, you must go.

1793
02:12:22,304 --> 02:12:23,976
No, you must go.
- No, no, no.

1794
02:12:24,064 --> 02:12:26,453
Listen to me.
- No, no, no.

1795
02:12:26,544 --> 02:12:28,136
You should not be here.

1796
02:12:28,224 --> 02:12:31,978
This one you cannot repair. Now go.

1797
02:12:45,984 --> 02:12:47,656
Mama, Rizvan.

1798
02:12:51,424 --> 02:12:53,574
Oh, God the church is going to fall.

1799
02:12:53,664 --> 02:12:55,302
We're going to die.

1800
02:12:55,384 --> 02:12:57,454
The church is going to fall.

1801
02:13:46,144 --> 02:13:49,295
Hadith says that the Almighty
does not judge by color or creed..

1802
02:13:49,384 --> 02:13:50,737
..but by actions and deeds.

1803
02:13:50,824 --> 02:13:52,177
lf that is the truth..

1804
02:13:52,264 --> 02:13:53,777
..then Rizvan Khan by the
sheer force of his actions..

1805
02:13:53,864 --> 02:13:56,697
..has elevated the entire
humanity in the eyes of God.

1806
02:13:57,744 --> 02:13:59,939
Just recently this
man was arrested..

1807
02:14:00,024 --> 02:14:03,380
..and tortured for being
an enemy combatant of this country.

1808
02:14:03,624 --> 02:14:06,013
Wonder what the government
officials would call this..

1809
02:14:06,104 --> 02:14:08,140
..Muslim enemy combatant today?

1810
02:14:08,224 --> 02:14:11,500
As he selflessly tries to save
the remaining lives in Wilhemina.

1811
02:14:11,584 --> 02:14:13,893
Just a few days ago this
man was called a terrorist..

1812
02:14:13,984 --> 02:14:15,303
..and tortured mercilessly.

1813
02:14:15,384 --> 02:14:17,818
Today we wait for the response
of the government officials..

1814
02:14:17,904 --> 02:14:21,101
..as he tirelessly
strives to save innocent lives.

1815
02:14:21,184 --> 02:14:22,822
lf the authorities want
to find the true enemy..

1816
02:14:22,904 --> 02:14:24,815
..combatant of this country.

1817
02:14:24,904 --> 02:14:28,579
Then they would find it in the
grief and debris of Wilhemina.

1818
02:14:29,104 --> 02:14:31,777
lt's a long journey
to change the world.

1819
02:14:31,864 --> 02:14:36,460
But the first few steps have been
taken by Rizvan Khan in Wilhemina.

1820
02:14:37,984 --> 02:14:41,294
lsn't it our duty now to
take this journey forward?

1821
02:14:41,424 --> 02:14:43,574
Raj Burman, Star News.

1822
02:14:53,384 --> 02:14:56,694
Please don't take my
baby away from me.

1823
02:14:56,984 --> 02:15:00,101
Please don't take my
baby away from me.

1824
02:15:01,544 --> 02:15:05,457
Mandira, people are suffering
here and are very helpless.

1825
02:15:06,104 --> 02:15:09,938
l wish l could take
all of them from here.

1826
02:15:10,184 --> 02:15:12,778
But l don't have the
physical strength to do that.

1827
02:15:15,144 --> 02:15:17,612
Mama Jenny is right..

1828
02:15:17,704 --> 02:15:21,094
This one.. this one l can't repair.

1829
02:15:24,184 --> 02:15:28,063
Now we can only await
the Lord's merciful eye.

1830
02:15:34,824 --> 02:15:40,660
Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama!

1831
02:16:35,104 --> 02:16:36,935
While several hurricane hit areas..

1832
02:16:37,024 --> 02:16:39,140
..have suffered from
government inaction.

1833
02:16:39,224 --> 02:16:43,058
One small town in Georgia is
slowly getting back on its feet.

1834
02:16:43,464 --> 02:16:46,297
This group has brought
something more valuable than money.

1835
02:16:46,384 --> 02:16:48,215
They brought themselves.

1836
02:16:48,304 --> 02:16:50,374
The US government may
have forgotten the flood..

1837
02:16:50,464 --> 02:16:52,136
..inflicted area of Wilhemina,
Georgia..

1838
02:16:52,224 --> 02:16:54,260
..but one man has
refused to be indifferent..

1839
02:16:54,344 --> 02:16:56,096
..to the plight of its inhabitants.

1840
02:16:56,184 --> 02:16:58,652
This one man has spared
no efforts in helping..

1841
02:16:58,744 --> 02:17:02,100
..rehabilitate the
population of Wilhemina.

1842
02:17:02,744 --> 02:17:04,894
Looking at him as an
inspiration today..

1843
02:17:04,984 --> 02:17:08,340
..many Americans have
rushed to Wilhemina..

1844
02:17:08,424 --> 02:17:11,860
..and its neighboring towns to help
in rebuilding the destroyed towns.

1845
02:17:11,944 --> 02:17:14,412
And all this just
because of one man..

1846
02:17:14,504 --> 02:17:16,495
..whose name is Rizvan Khan..

1847
02:17:16,584 --> 02:17:20,463
..and who, in his own words,
is not a 'terrorist'..

1848
02:17:30,704 --> 02:17:32,422
Following the example of Wilhemina..

1849
02:17:32,504 --> 02:17:34,779
..towns are being
adopted across the country.

1850
02:17:34,864 --> 02:17:36,855
And while our military
is tied up in lraq..

1851
02:17:36,944 --> 02:17:38,662
..reconstruction of these towns..

1852
02:17:38,744 --> 02:17:41,577
..has been taken on
by ordinary Americans.

1853
02:17:41,664 --> 02:17:44,974
And today, as our
special guest from Wilhemina..

1854
02:17:45,064 --> 02:17:47,134
..we have the man, who
got the whole ball rolling.

1855
02:17:47,224 --> 02:17:48,816
Mr. Rizvan Khan.

1856
02:17:48,904 --> 02:17:52,738
Oh no, no, no it's Khan.
- Excuse me.

1857
02:17:52,824 --> 02:17:54,496
Khan.
- Excuse me.

1858
02:17:54,584 --> 02:17:55,858
Khan.
- One minute.

1859
02:17:55,944 --> 02:17:57,980
From the epiglottis, ma'am. Khan.

1860
02:17:58,064 --> 02:18:00,134
l'm sorry, Rizvan.

1861
02:18:00,304 --> 02:18:03,296
Maybe you could tell us why
you want to meet the president?

1862
02:18:03,544 --> 02:18:06,502
Senator, you need to take a look
at these campaign accounts. - Later.

1863
02:18:06,584 --> 02:18:07,983
l want to watch this.

1864
02:18:08,624 --> 02:18:11,058
My beautiful wife, Mandira.

1865
02:18:11,584 --> 02:18:18,183
She.. she told me to go and
meet the President of America.

1866
02:18:18,584 --> 02:18:21,781
A long tiring journey,
Rizvan. What kept you going?

1867
02:18:21,864 --> 02:18:24,662
My son's soccer shoes.

1868
02:18:24,744 --> 02:18:30,057
My son Sam, and his best friend
Reese, they they love playing soccer.

1869
02:18:37,744 --> 02:18:39,541
l'm sorry Mrs. Khan,
l didn't know what to do.

1870
02:18:39,624 --> 02:18:42,058
And l was scared.
And they threatened hurt me.

1871
02:18:42,144 --> 02:18:43,623
And l'm sorry.

1872
02:18:43,704 --> 02:18:46,218
l'm just really, really sorry.

1873
02:18:46,304 --> 02:18:51,503
l'm sorry Mrs..
- Sorry is not good enough.

1874
02:18:53,264 --> 02:18:55,334
That's just not good enough.

1875
02:19:28,144 --> 02:19:30,817
Thank you for asking
for leniency for me.

1876
02:19:32,824 --> 02:19:35,782
l didn't do it for you,
l did it for your mom.

1877
02:19:36,664 --> 02:19:38,620
My mom won't forgive me.

1878
02:19:39,744 --> 02:19:42,417
She will. She's a mom.

1879
02:20:20,544 --> 02:20:23,377
Mandira, this is Sarah.

1880
02:20:23,464 --> 02:20:24,533
Thanks.

1881
02:20:24,624 --> 02:20:26,854
Thank you for Reese.

1882
02:20:27,344 --> 02:20:31,860
And l hope and pray that
Sam's soul rests in peace.

1883
02:20:33,344 --> 02:20:36,893
Mandira, we both know what it
feels like to lose people we love.

1884
02:20:38,184 --> 02:20:40,493
l lost my husband to hate.

1885
02:20:41,264 --> 02:20:43,255
Don't lose Rizvan.

1886
02:20:43,344 --> 02:20:48,623
Let go of your anger, just let go.

1887
02:21:02,504 --> 02:21:03,937
l love you son.

1888
02:21:19,904 --> 02:21:21,781
Zakir, Hasina.

1889
02:21:21,944 --> 02:21:23,582
l'm leaving now.. Bye, bye.

1890
02:21:23,664 --> 02:21:26,417
Bhai why do you have to
leave so late at night?

1891
02:21:26,504 --> 02:21:28,017
l've to go now.

1892
02:21:28,104 --> 02:21:30,140
lt is three days to the
Presidential election.

1893
02:21:30,224 --> 02:21:31,418
After that the
President will change.

1894
02:21:31,504 --> 02:21:33,017
l have to meet him before that.

1895
02:21:33,104 --> 02:21:35,982
Now, l need to meet him now.
Now, now.

1896
02:22:48,264 --> 02:22:49,982
Leave me!

1897
02:22:50,064 --> 02:22:53,101
You got Dr. Rehman arrested!

1898
02:22:53,264 --> 02:22:56,336
You are an infidel!
This is your punishment, Khan!

1899
02:22:56,424 --> 02:22:58,574
This is your punishment!
You have to die!

1900
02:22:58,664 --> 02:23:00,416
lslam will never forgive you!

1901
02:23:00,504 --> 02:23:01,983
Leave me!

1902
02:23:02,064 --> 02:23:05,295
Oh Lord!!

1903
02:23:05,384 --> 02:23:08,774
The United States of
America has a new President.

1904
02:23:08,864 --> 02:23:09,933
Doctor, he just got up.

1905
02:23:10,024 --> 02:23:11,935
Let me check all his vitals,
lets go.

1906
02:23:49,504 --> 02:23:52,496
There are only two kinds
of people in this world.

1907
02:23:55,304 --> 02:23:58,262
He died because of you.
Because of your surname!

1908
02:23:59,984 --> 02:24:01,815
Leave me alone.

1909
02:24:02,024 --> 02:24:03,696
Go right now! This instant!

1910
02:24:03,784 --> 02:24:06,742
Go now, now.

1911
02:24:08,984 --> 02:24:11,100
When should l come back, Mandira?

1912
02:24:51,584 --> 02:24:54,894
l.. l didn't die, Mandira.

1913
02:24:56,504 --> 02:24:59,860
No, you didn't.

1914
02:25:02,344 --> 02:25:05,780
Can l get a hug, please?

1915
02:25:06,024 --> 02:25:07,537
Please.

1916
02:25:15,384 --> 02:25:18,615
l love you.

1917
02:25:19,104 --> 02:25:21,060
l love you too.

1918
02:25:30,704 --> 02:25:33,537
Today the President elect visits
flood inflicted Georgia State.

1919
02:25:33,624 --> 02:25:35,774
The question is
whether Rizvan Khan..

1920
02:25:35,864 --> 02:25:40,142
..who has just been discharged from
the hospital will get to meet him.

1921
02:25:40,224 --> 02:25:44,934
Khan has refused to go back home
until he meets the President elect.

1922
02:25:45,024 --> 02:25:47,174
Raj Burman.. Star News.

1923
02:25:48,144 --> 02:25:50,260
Khan.. let's go home. You
don't need to do this now.

1924
02:25:50,344 --> 02:25:51,538
No, no, no.

1925
02:25:51,624 --> 02:25:53,740
Why?
- No, no, no.

1926
02:25:53,824 --> 02:25:56,384
l have to meet the President.

1927
02:25:56,784 --> 02:26:01,983
Ammi had said, ''A Khan
always keeps his word!''

1928
02:26:03,944 --> 02:26:07,698
Folks, we'll make sure
we do everything we can..

1929
02:26:07,784 --> 02:26:10,218
..to bring Georgia back on its feet.

1930
02:26:11,544 --> 02:26:12,613
Thank you.

1931
02:26:13,624 --> 02:26:15,455
After winning the election..

1932
02:26:15,544 --> 02:26:18,456
..the President elect in
his first Presidential tour..

1933
02:26:18,544 --> 02:26:20,580
..has announced a
special relief package..

1934
02:26:20,664 --> 02:26:23,258
..for the flood
inflicted Georgia State.

1935
02:26:26,464 --> 02:26:27,738
After offering aid to
the state of Georgia..

1936
02:26:27,824 --> 02:26:29,655
The President will go to
New York from here to..

1937
02:26:29,744 --> 02:26:32,656
..participate in the
United Nations' special summit.

1938
02:26:37,304 --> 02:26:40,341
Back off please, clear the area.
Please clear the area.

1939
02:26:40,424 --> 02:26:42,255
The President has left. Please.

1940
02:26:42,344 --> 02:26:43,459
That's Rizvan Khan.

1941
02:26:43,544 --> 02:26:45,580
Please back.
- l want to see the President.

1942
02:26:45,664 --> 02:26:46,733
President's left please.

1943
02:26:46,824 --> 02:26:49,975
Rizvan Khan who has been in the news
for all his efforts in Wilhemina..

1944
02:26:50,064 --> 02:26:52,453
..is now at the Governor's mansion.

1945
02:26:53,624 --> 02:26:57,412
He has been trying to meet
the President for a while now.

1946
02:26:57,504 --> 02:27:01,782
lt's sad that he won't
meet the President even today.

1947
02:27:01,864 --> 02:27:04,298
Rizvan Khan's supporters are
quite dejected at this prospect.

1948
02:27:04,384 --> 02:27:07,854
However it looks like he'll face
disappointment all over again.

1949
02:27:08,344 --> 02:27:10,460
A disappointed group
of Khan's supporters..

1950
02:27:10,544 --> 02:27:12,853
..are getting ready to turn back.

1951
02:27:14,584 --> 02:27:16,575
Copy that, Regal is on foot.

1952
02:27:17,624 --> 02:27:20,422
Repeat that please.
- Regal is on foot.

1953

Are you Rizvan Khan?

1954
02:27:49,424 --> 02:27:50,493
Yes.
- Yes, sir.

1955
02:27:50,584 --> 02:27:52,256
The President wants to meet you.

1956
02:28:25,104 --> 02:28:27,664
Greetings..

1957
02:28:28,184 --> 02:28:32,063
Rizvan Khan, good to
see you hale and hearty.

1958
02:28:32,464 --> 02:28:33,863
You're on TV more than me now.

02:28:33,944 --> 02:28:35,775

1960

1968

He's sorry.

1969
02:29:05,704 --> 02:29:10,380
All of us share this world
before brief moment in time.

1970
02:29:10,664 --> 02:29:16,022
And l'm honoured to share
the time of Rizvan Khan.

1971
02:29:18,824 --> 02:29:21,099
Rizvan has reminded us..

1972
02:29:21,584 --> 02:29:22,983
Sam..

1973
02:29:23,784 --> 02:29:28,221
Our Khan has managed to achieve,
with his love and humanity..

1974
02:29:28,544 --> 02:29:30,899
..what my hatred
could never achieve.

1975
02:29:31,464 --> 02:29:33,659
My anger threw us apart..

1976
02:29:34,144 --> 02:29:37,773
..but today his love has
brought us together in a way..

1977
02:29:38,064 --> 02:29:41,215
..where we remember
you with renewed hope.

1978
02:29:50,024 --> 02:29:52,822
Now l will never let
him go anywhere, Sam.

1979
02:29:53,184 --> 02:29:56,176
l will keep this love with me..

1980
02:29:56,984 --> 02:30:02,183
For me.. For you.. Forever!

1981
02:30:05,144 --> 02:30:07,942
Anything else, Rizvan?
- Yes.

1982
02:30:08,024 --> 02:30:12,575
John Marshall, Homeland security,
San Francisco said to say, ''Howdy''.

1983
02:30:13,104 --> 02:30:14,822
Howdy?
- Howdy.
