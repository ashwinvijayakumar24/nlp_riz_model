East India came here for business
But now it is ruling

00:00:53,548 --> 00:00:56,545
Many areas dominate

7
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:58,675
People are getting theirs

8
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:04,241
But Ronak Poor soil is still free

9
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:29,818
We need to look after our home

00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:35,739
Who's this?

00:01:36,198 --> 00:01:41,165

what are you doing?
I'm dandoned

14
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:54,270
Two of my two tears broke out in the ceremony

15
00:01:55,117 --> 00:01:56,906
Do not come yet

16
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,229
Who's this?
Khodabakhsh

17
00:02:04,112 --> 00:02:05,007
what about me?

18
00:02:05,047 --> 00:02:08,285
You and your mother rest
... Slam is on his own

19
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:11,773
I and God protect the territory

20
00:02:12,429 --> 00:02:15,263
Let's go to the protector's house now?
.Not

21
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:19,456
Let's go to your mother
Your dungeon breaks down

22
00:02:19,852 --> 00:02:22,319
Do not be so scared of your wife

23
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:24,939
come here

24
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:42,070
Bad to me

25
00:02:42,737 --> 00:02:46,370

00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:48,529
you're welcome
- I do not care

27
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,341
Are you looking

28
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,452
Are you looking
Sir

29
00:02:52,984 --> 00:02:56,082
See all my stuff I'm killing

30
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:02,373
Say from the government
They have the right to do anything

31
00:03:02,743 --> 00:03:06,575
The company's ruling is not worth it here
And will not

32
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:13,924
Get lost to Gorton from here
And do not go again

33
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,594
Get away

34
00:03:36,223 --> 00:03:37,952
What did you say

35
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:41,772
.Not

36
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:46,267
If it was so dangerous
Why did you send your slam with khadabakhsh?

37
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:52,937
It was important

38
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,577
Khodabakhsh is a fighter
The name is just a kid

39
00:03:56,864 --> 00:03:58,175
My son is

40
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:00,204
What was needed?

41
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:03,231
... If you do not spend your time now

42
00:04:04,538 --> 00:04:06,624
I'm coming to the end ...

43
00:04:31,218 --> 00:04:34,800
Khodabakhsh and Aslam with twenty people
To help go to Diegapur

44
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:38,569
But still do not go
... There is no use for now

45
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:40,586
!Friends

46
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:48,291
We need to turn to the company as soon as possible
And overcome them

47
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:50,268
... if we do not do anything now

48
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:54,459
Like all other cities
We will also become their bearer

49
00:04:56,262 --> 00:05:01,197
Tomorrow is the flag in the company's area
Raise up

50
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:05,878
Sir
See you sooner

51
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:22,693
... Treat them like a guest

52
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,671
... But if I mention, understand it

53
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:30,038
They are not guests
They are enemies

54
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:10,154
Hello dear Mirza
I'm ashamed of you at this time of the night

55
00:06:10,497 --> 00:06:14,216
Your dear friend, Mr Clive

56
00:06:15,406 --> 00:06:18,305
how can I help you?

57
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:47,932
Thinking about your friend?

58
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:50,964
You have a friend name
Slave sells

59
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:53,911
We are the merchant, Mr. Mirza

60
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,059
Sales are ours

61
00:06:56,222 --> 00:06:58,525
... But Nitta is governed

62
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:02,432
...in the future

63
00:07:02,925 --> 00:07:06,329
The main rulers will be businessmen

64
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:08,275
Are you a futuristic one?

65
00:07:08,725 --> 00:07:10,106
I'm not an opportunist

66
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,894
Opportunity and truth
I recognize

67
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:17,232
Really?

68
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:37,399
You like the words of the lyrics
You hide something

69
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:46,645
Just like your cup of tea
That's a good smell

70
00:07:47,528 --> 00:07:50,411
.... We also have that and that

71
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:53,016
There is a bar

72
00:07:57,456 --> 00:08:02,924
And the great truth is hidden in this poem

73
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:12,869
... in the two-day dinner
.... In the evening without the moon

74
00:08:13,712 --> 00:08:20,474
"Riding on a horse, a person to punish sinners"

75
00:08:23,156 --> 00:08:25,563
... This poem is more than poetry

76
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:29,253
It's like a deception

77
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:38,258
The last poem of this book is my son
Slam wrote

78
00:08:38,763 --> 00:08:42,720
And this poem is written against you

79
00:08:46,162 --> 00:08:48,588
This book was pre-slam

80
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,691
When your hand is
It just means one thing

81
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:57,427
That my son was martyred

82
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,868
... Dice is yours, Mr. Mirza

83
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:04,550
I'm so well ...

84
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:10,778
So I want to get something done

85
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:29,321

87
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:36,535
Friendship with us, Mr. Mirza

88
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:42,661
It's not good with us

89
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,574
... got what you wanted

90
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:26,771
Now let's release my son ...

91
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:29,671

Do not see any problems?

109
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:08,691
You have to pay a bad tax

110
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:10,463
Tax?

111
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:14,903
The company is on the ground
Everyone wants to cross, you have to pay taxes

112
00:17:15,257 --> 00:17:16,810
. For each person one

113
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:21,550
Lady or master?

114

115
00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:25,710
.... When both the master and the bearer are going to die

116
00:17:29,193 --> 00:17:30,193
What does it cost?

00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:31,753
Lord lord

118
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:34,235
Well, you gotta get my money from my lord

00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:35,726
Who are you?

120
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:39,113

Navab Fardeddin, Hakim al-Din
Great lord

122
00:17:44,357 --> 00:17:46,701
Give it to her somebody
I'm sorry

123
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:49,530
What's so rude?
Get the money from the donkey

124
00:17:49,674 --> 00:17:52,364
Take me to the canyon to count your hands

125
00:17:52,456 --> 00:17:53,395
Mr. Inspector

126
00:17:53,444 --> 00:17:56,205
Sometimes it's not something you can imagine
And that's not what you see

127
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,747
See, this is our master
And we are her boyfriend

128
00:18:00,936 --> 00:18:03,447
You do not see, but this is the master

129
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:08,208
And since the company has come
It's a lot of lords

130
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:12,002
They are all donkeys
But it will not be known

131
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:15,595
Mr, ah, a wonderful word

132
00:18:15,838 --> 00:18:18,941
"Your letter is correct"
"But my servant is right"

133
00:18:18,941 --> 00:18:20,482
... they are cunning

134
00:18:20,927 --> 00:18:23,633
Where is this master
Master Champoor is a gentleman

135
00:18:24,077 --> 00:18:25,738
... He trusted the company now

136
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:30,131
It should be a move away from its own region,
What do they say to her, tax

137
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,716
You need to pay taxes

138
00:18:31,847 --> 00:18:34,320
Come on, sir

139
00:18:34,644 --> 00:18:38,296
We are late
I'll give her a share

140
00:18:38,296 --> 00:18:39,623
!Excellency

141
00:18:41,212 --> 00:18:43,175
. I do not accept charity

142
00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:45,363
I'll pay for it

143
00:18:45,815 --> 00:18:48,096
I'll be with you
I delight you

144
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,281
The path is so short
That you do not know

145
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:53,893
There is a bad guy
what is your name?

146
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:55,966
Flying sailor

147
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,666
Village of Gopalpur
Kanpur district, Awad

148
00:19:16,312 --> 00:19:20,390
I like that kind of food
Eat your finger too

149
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:23,517
Evil Fiery

150
00:19:23,784 --> 00:19:26,418
Do not you have a better thing?

151
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:31,129
Listening to these angels is always between

152
00:19:31,643 --> 00:19:34,029
But if you have a chance
Fairy comes along with her

153
00:20:58,803 --> 00:21:01,831
Do not throw it, loathe it
Then go to the card

154
00:21:09,104 --> 00:21:13,054
This thief is very new
Forget the ring

155
00:21:13,531 --> 00:21:16,231
Dying for yourself
Otherwise, take a serious shot

156
00:21:36,823 --> 00:21:40,999
To be seven passengers
Five rupees per rupee are 35 rupees

157
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:44,428
35 I will show you a beautiful silver coin

158
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,717
. And one way to tax the route

159
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,676
Are you kidding you?

160
00:21:49,544 --> 00:21:52,701
The procedure is the same
I had to get along with them

161
00:21:53,205 --> 00:21:54,205
Keep it up

162
00:21:54,384 --> 00:21:55,384
32 to

163
00:21:55,843 --> 00:21:56,843
22

164
00:21:57,118 --> 00:22:00,133
We're going to pay the price
Be ridiculous

165
00:22:00,776 --> 00:22:02,499
28 I will not see more a century

166
00:22:02,806 --> 00:22:06,125
I'll get 30 and the other two bags of rice

167
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,932
See you are everyone

168
00:22:48,192 --> 00:22:49,192
Yes

169
00:22:49,676 --> 00:22:52,463
Finger on her words

170
00:22:53,147 --> 00:22:55,384
I said twenty to give you a thief
One was not enough

171
00:22:55,756 --> 00:22:57,525
The card has good numbers

172
00:22:59,055 --> 00:23:03,667
For each killer I will get 10
For this twenty to 200 coins

173
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:05,653
We had 100 coins

174
00:23:06,097 --> 00:23:09,709
Mr., see you all this bug

175
00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:12,526
I've compromised myself

176
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:16,951
Maybe you have to say: Come on, this is your 100th
And this is 100 coins

177
00:23:17,587 --> 00:23:20,477
all right
Keep waiting for the boss

178
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:23,967
...Excellency

179
00:23:24,517 --> 00:23:29,261
I do not expect death
... the sooner I have to go to Rasoulpur

180
00:23:30,168 --> 00:23:31,988
Where's that gonna be?

181
00:23:34,107 --> 00:23:35,964
No news, sir

182
00:23:38,758 --> 00:23:40,623
My grandmother died

183
00:23:43,357 --> 00:23:46,074
I promised you
So I did the job first

184
00:23:46,734 --> 00:23:49,218
But doing it is with me

185
00:23:49,522 --> 00:23:51,040
!OK

186
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,185
come and get it

187
00:23:54,211 --> 00:23:55,633
!Grand mother

188
00:23:59,261 --> 00:24:01,365
Grandmother, where did you go

189
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:06,613
... dear master, remember

190
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:10,291
For grandma, a little charity

191
00:24:11,194 --> 00:24:13,791
Always coming to us
let's go

192
00:24:48,858 --> 00:24:51,886
No way
look there

193
00:24:52,265 --> 00:24:53,265
what has happened?

194
00:24:53,303 --> 00:24:56,581
We do not allow them to come

195
00:24:56,635 --> 00:24:58,984
Have a receipt? Yes
I did not write anything about it

196
00:24:59,322 --> 00:25:01,448
What are the gadgets
Mirror

197
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,246
!that's beautiful

198
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:37,958
Singh's verdict

199
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,261
Captain
We must move now

200
00:25:41,213 --> 00:25:42,493
Orum Dadash

201
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:44,541
Take you to the ship

202
00:29:28,424 --> 00:29:30,855
Come on fast

203
00:30:02,436 --> 00:30:06,820
Intagram Bollywood Van
Instagram.Com/Bolly1official

204
00:30:26,235 --> 00:30:27,293
What is this coat?

205
00:30:27,489 --> 00:30:30,295
Is Hindu
Is our enemy

206
00:30:31,106 --> 00:30:34,196
His name is Freedom

207
00:30:53,386 --> 00:30:55,331
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom

208
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,965
I'm tired of hearing this name

209
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:00,639
He throws a thunder to him

210
00:31:00,954 --> 00:31:04,964
Threatens you in our territory?

211
00:31:05,439 --> 00:31:07,039
Sir, do not worry

212
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:10,973
I end up doing this free

213
00:31:11,223 --> 00:31:13,397
For you, freedom is just an outlaw

214
00:31:14,096 --> 00:31:15,747
There is a killer for us

215
00:31:16,366 --> 00:31:20,327
I do not know why people are so respected

216
00:31:20,655 --> 00:31:21,959
how about you ?

217
00:31:22,763 --> 00:31:26,847
We heard that it was free from the biggapour
Much help?

218
00:31:27,106 --> 00:31:28,957
These are rumors, sir

219
00:31:29,365 --> 00:31:33,542
The great lord knows that
We are so loyal to them

220
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:36,300
You must help us in this war

221
00:31:36,598 --> 00:31:38,647
We will respond with fire

222
00:31:38,871 --> 00:31:43,084
Forget about freedom
... if someone calls him a bad name

223
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:45,201
Directly goes to jail

224
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:47,155
Thankful

225
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:53,959
Thank you, for this fight
We need guns and guns

226
00:31:54,632 --> 00:31:56,649
You just give us this

227
00:31:58,869 --> 00:32:00,059
Sure

228
00:32:00,645 --> 00:32:02,153
Thank you very much

229
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:16,312
It can be a gun and gunpowder
Let's go ahead

230
00:32:16,596 --> 00:32:18,544
I doubt my sermon

231
00:32:18,845 --> 00:32:20,886
I doubt everyone

232
00:32:22,064 --> 00:32:26,128
... but to hunt milk

233
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:30,382
We have to bite the sheep

234
00:32:30,834 --> 00:32:33,487
The people of Freedom are the Messiah of Messiah

235
00:32:33,881 --> 00:32:37,786
And the hunting of Christ with sheep is not feasible

236
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:43,130
No other animal in your mind?

237
00:32:43,651 --> 00:32:49,024
His figure is like human beings
But their work is like wicked animals

238
00:32:49,452 --> 00:32:52,436
And his behavior is different
There is nobody but friv

239
00:32:54,815 --> 00:32:56,617
Get out of it
apology

240
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:03,887
Soon, Soraya Jan

241
00:33:04,153 --> 00:33:05,692
Soraya Jan

242
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:08,703
Soraya Jan

243
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:11,488
Soraya Jan
Soraya Jan

244
00:33:11,586 --> 00:33:14,543
Soraya Jan
Soraya Jan

245
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:18,382
What are you doing soraya
The white men are waiting to wait

246
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:08,607
What do you think of me today?

247
00:34:21,701 --> 00:34:22,701
hit

248
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:24,352
Bounce again

249
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,370
But if I tell the truth
It wakes up

250
00:34:28,582 --> 00:34:30,490
My grandmother died
What would I do?

251
00:34:30,774 --> 00:34:32,787
Oh my God! Grand mother?

252
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,425
I loved her very much

253
00:34:36,005 --> 00:34:37,563
.Sure

254
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:41,940
For the one that has the fourth one
Miskhish, Hermit

255
00:34:42,864 --> 00:34:44,822
Have you already killed the grandmothers?

256
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,909
Your mother was in bad condition too

257
00:34:47,248 --> 00:34:49,623
You just changed the name of Haro

258
00:34:50,426 --> 00:34:52,694
What are you doing sorry

259
00:34:52,694 --> 00:34:54,494
I'm coming now, aunt

260
00:34:56,765 --> 00:34:59,052
Where are you going to rush

261
00:35:01,327 --> 00:35:03,878
... the company has requested

262
00:35:04,912 --> 00:35:11,254
That's good today
... just dance for foreigners

263
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,535
...Only

264
00:35:14,648 --> 00:35:15,886
...what about me

265
00:35:20,568 --> 00:35:21,945
The command is captain

266
00:35:22,661 --> 00:35:24,781
... that if it's a mistake too

267
00:35:25,648 --> 00:35:29,883
... Take a Hindustan there

268
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:37,569
If I say this is Indian Hindi
Just what's your reason for you?

269
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:44,570
Do not say that heart, dear sir

270
00:35:50,987 --> 00:35:52,957
Do you really love real dai

271
00:35:53,223 --> 00:35:56,291
For a lover in your closet
... Everyday, I'm going to be here

272
00:35:57,311 --> 00:35:59,053
And the silent, interrupted and gone

273
00:36:00,813 --> 00:36:04,509
... Such people are crazy

274
00:36:05,695 --> 00:36:07,095
... I'm not open

275
00:36:09,122 --> 00:36:15,568
Lover that without fear of the whole world
She expresses love, she is in front of everyone

276
00:36:18,025 --> 00:36:20,063
You do not have hope

277
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,038
!Sir

278
00:36:49,928 --> 00:36:51,846

You are singing between 200 English singers
And you do not get arrested

318
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:28,461
How did you think that?

319
00:41:29,527 --> 00:41:32,284
The name is Furangi

320
00:41:32,983 --> 00:41:36,809
I am from the inside
Outside, it's a little Indian

321
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,470
Have a picnic?

322
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:43,447
Did you think I'm having a drink right now?

323
00:41:43,656 --> 00:41:45,347
I'm downhill

324
00:41:48,304 --> 00:41:49,704
Is allowed?

... free

326
00:42:06,248 --> 00:42:07,807
Did you hear his name

327
00:42:10,106 --> 00:42:12,141
Sir, I am your messenger

328
00:42:12,515 --> 00:42:14,695
... Getting the killers is not a problem for us

329
00:42:15,821 --> 00:42:17,694
But it's free

330
00:42:18,113 --> 00:42:20,662
It's not up to us to fall into it

331
00:42:21,524 --> 00:42:24,936
Fringe, you've gotten a very aggressive two-year-old

332
00:42:25,147 --> 00:42:28,620
How long are you looking for these ten twenty coins?

333
00:42:29,135 --> 00:42:32,284
Think big, think carefully

334
00:42:34,611 --> 00:42:38,924
One predictor said that
I'm going to be a stranger

335
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,585
I have to see England once, sir

336
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:46,828
One, two, did something
Three and four tenths, happy night

337
00:42:47,428 --> 00:42:51,114
I wanna go to english

338
00:42:51,565 --> 00:42:53,304
This is my dream

339
00:42:53,867 --> 00:42:55,417
Let me know

340
00:42:55,977 --> 00:42:57,332
Ten thousand gold coins

341
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:01,543
There is a house next to the pond
And forty acres of agricultural land

342
00:43:02,394 --> 00:43:05,012
I see you started the program

343
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:10,558
When you gamble
You must also take a big risk

344
00:43:11,225 --> 00:43:12,225
.Chapter

345
00:43:12,845 --> 00:43:14,352
Say hello, I want some help

346
00:43:15,049 --> 00:43:16,049
When

347
00:43:16,237 --> 00:43:20,431
Land, wind, water
And monsters, they all have their own language

348
00:43:21,219 --> 00:43:24,620
We do not understand their language

349
00:43:25,575 --> 00:43:30,650
But I know such a person
That's the language of this thing

350
00:43:31,068 --> 00:43:32,245
Where is ?

351
00:43:32,617 --> 00:43:35,600
Where more people get stuck

352
00:44:05,607 --> 00:44:07,992
There is bad news in the way

353
00:44:11,205 --> 00:44:13,025
Good news?

354
00:44:14,564 --> 00:44:17,557
Treacherous

355
00:44:21,632 --> 00:44:23,914
I do not want to flutter

356
00:44:24,444 --> 00:44:26,669
Shut up
Dirty Hindi

357
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,556
Hello sir sanicher

358
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:40,867
Fiery

359
00:44:41,593 --> 00:44:43,664
A friend of a childhood

360
00:44:44,554 --> 00:44:47,289
I hope you do not explode

361
00:44:48,081 --> 00:44:50,241
... I have not seen you for years

362
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:53,193
The end of our visit was the same time
You got me in this prison

363
00:44:54,132 --> 00:44:56,019
Your face is in front of me

364
00:44:56,974 --> 00:44:59,563
Forget Harry's Comrade Past

365
00:45:00,718 --> 00:45:01,943
why not?

366
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:05,073
Let's forget all the past

367
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:06,989
What do you want to forget about now?

368
00:45:07,379 --> 00:45:09,287
How did you throw me in jail?

369
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:13,148
Or have you escaped with your fiancé?

370
00:45:13,759 --> 00:45:16,766
We did not escape. Comrade
We just changed the weather

371
00:45:17,065 --> 00:45:19,413
He wanted to give him a little distance

372
00:45:19,729 --> 00:45:21,062
I swear to my grandmother

373
00:45:21,528 --> 00:45:24,313
The treachery of my friend was in my horoscope

374
00:45:25,102 --> 00:45:28,238
So when thirteen years old
I fast at night

375
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:33,299
I prayed so much to get rid of this curse and doom

376
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:42,375
... Sannicher

377
00:45:43,214 --> 00:45:45,377
... I've been your friend for many years

378
00:45:46,804 --> 00:45:48,994
I know a little cheater

379
00:45:49,452 --> 00:45:50,831
.. I do not do it

380
00:45:52,355 --> 00:45:54,892
But I value my friendship

381
00:45:55,665 --> 00:45:58,449
The value is low
But it is

382
00:46:01,815 --> 00:46:04,484
Come join us for the last time

383
00:46:07,257 --> 00:46:09,933
You want to give me a headache

384
00:46:11,948 --> 00:46:14,032
I dreamed for you

385
00:46:14,659 --> 00:46:16,972
I live it

386
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:19,453
... land, capital, bride

387
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,705
The coin and the coin are ...

388
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:23,728
That's the way

389
00:46:27,648 --> 00:46:28,865
What's the job

390
00:46:31,484 --> 00:46:33,518
Finding free

391
00:46:34,074 --> 00:46:35,846
Evil Baba

392
00:46:36,098 --> 00:46:38,446
Live live alive I'm going to grave

393
00:46:38,992 --> 00:46:40,918
I think so big, Mr. Santicher

394
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:44,726
With my wisdom and your thoughts
We will love and live for the rest of our lives

395
00:46:51,916 --> 00:46:53,651
Eul Baba

396
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:06,338
Fiery, this time we are not deceiving
Okay, Dad, I'll swear to my grandmother

397
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,314
Bring wine

398
00:48:15,908 --> 00:48:17,743
Happy
Shed

399
00:48:18,182 --> 00:48:19,644
Drink gods

400
00:48:19,998 --> 00:48:24,514
In the old days, the gods are shabby
Britons are now eating

401
00:48:24,612 --> 00:48:27,701
Gods today they are
Yeah

402
00:48:27,957 --> 00:48:29,460
We have come to find freedom
Do not drink wine

403
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:37,147
Sounds sad in the north
Goes south of the penguin

404
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:41,057
... according to my signs

405
00:48:41,348 --> 00:48:44,853
Our goal will be in the south

406
00:48:45,127 --> 00:48:48,651
By crossing the waterway
This is the saying of the stars

407
00:48:49,037 --> 00:48:53,527
The ship goes to the Viking
We'll get there

408
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:56,582
And free with hot tea
Welcomes us

409
00:48:56,835 --> 00:48:59,381
He says, say, eat tea
We will arrest you if you do not

410
00:48:59,711 --> 00:49:02,278
My job is to find it, so do it

411
00:49:02,698 --> 00:49:05,781
Your work and white skin too
Arresting him

412
00:49:23,847 --> 00:49:25,277
Give it a little bit to the baby, please

413
00:49:25,667 --> 00:49:28,535
Very feverish

414
00:49:36,796 --> 00:49:38,658
Do not stop it

415
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,664
!drink

416
00:50:01,863 --> 00:50:04,620
Please forgive me

417
00:50:07,653 --> 00:50:10,342
what are you doing?
Tell your captain

418
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,267
It's coming

419
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,612
You cursed

420
00:50:16,407 --> 00:50:18,386
Then straight into hell

421
00:50:38,353 --> 00:50:40,315
!leave me

422
00:50:59,012 --> 00:51:01,047
We're done

423
00:51:07,728 --> 00:51:09,151
Fire

424
00:51:26,224 --> 00:51:28,322
Go
Hide somewhere

425
00:51:32,175 --> 00:51:34,127
Hide

426
00:51:40,066 --> 00:51:42,443
Attack

427
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:11,287
!Fire

428
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:24,104
!Attack

429
00:53:00,018 --> 00:53:02,492
You wanted freedom, I found it

430
00:53:08,604 --> 00:53:11,768
Where are you going?
Your thinking and my cleverness

431
00:56:53,663 --> 00:56:54,663
!you alive

432
00:56:55,549 --> 00:56:57,151
I told you

433
00:56:57,437 --> 00:56:59,396
You were sleeping well

434
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,753
Now that you wake up is better

435
00:57:03,094 --> 00:57:06,977
Jaythin Bey, Doctor Degree here
He has any pain

436
00:57:07,228 --> 00:57:08,517
As well as the whole wine

437
00:57:08,744 --> 00:57:10,815
The last night is still in my head

438
00:57:11,478 --> 00:57:13,548
... Draw today too

439
00:57:14,022 --> 00:57:16,882
You're all set yourself apart

440
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:23,460
Did you find a new friend?

441
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:27,526
We are free in the hide

442
00:57:28,379 --> 00:57:30,344
This is the only way to save

443
00:57:30,652 --> 00:57:32,326
What was your anesthesia for four days?

444
00:57:32,634 --> 00:57:36,503
I had to be friends
And tell them the courage of my supporter

445
00:57:58,357 --> 00:58:00,149
Bring it here

446
00:58:04,158 --> 00:58:05,602
Take it there

447
00:58:16,165 --> 00:58:17,514
What is your name?

448
00:58:18,701 --> 00:58:20,399
We got the spy

449
00:58:28,992 --> 00:58:30,979
What information did the UK follow?

450
00:58:31,317 --> 00:58:33,737
Do you know what the spy punishment is?

451
00:58:36,811 --> 00:58:38,075
I'm wrong, sir

452
00:58:38,335 --> 00:58:40,471
I got a baby
excuse me

453
00:58:48,363 --> 00:58:49,771
Your job

454
00:58:51,253 --> 00:58:52,253
Kelim

455
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:55,029
Akbar and Gopal

456
00:58:55,546 --> 00:58:57,115
All martyrdom

457
00:58:59,206 --> 00:59:01,003
Everyone was for you

458
00:59:03,471 --> 00:59:07,216
The knight for Clive blinded you

459
00:59:08,891 --> 00:59:13,774
That you are after selling your brothers too
You're not ashamed again

460
00:59:18,449 --> 00:59:22,447
Your soul is captured by this man

461
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:26,297
I must give it up today

462
00:59:36,399 --> 00:59:40,976
Liberty

463
00:59:43,693 --> 00:59:48,796
Liberty

464
00:59:48,909 --> 00:59:51,421
Free

465
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:56,878
We are now responsible for protecting our family

466
01:00:14,957 --> 01:00:16,959
You've done a lot of courage

467
01:00:18,267 --> 01:00:20,667
Jan Maro saved you

468
01:00:24,112 --> 01:00:26,778
Well, take care of him
The first bartech

469
01:00:27,077 --> 01:00:29,849
Otherwise you kill people
But you will not save them

470
01:00:30,205 --> 01:00:31,846
I liked it

471
01:00:32,744 --> 01:00:34,791
It's too late for another one

472
01:00:35,266 --> 01:00:39,334
Find a good day
This is my mistress

473
01:00:40,632 --> 01:00:42,553
Believers have saved you

474
01:00:43,077 --> 01:00:45,096
what is your name?
where are you from?

475
01:00:45,699 --> 01:00:47,001
Fingerprint

476
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:50,223
Village of dwarara
Fateh Pour Sikri, Agra region

477
01:00:50,787 --> 01:00:52,426
But now everywhere I can live

478
01:00:57,447 --> 01:01:00,638
... let's lead you

479
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:05,625
Find your route as far as you can

480
01:01:05,925 --> 01:01:08,161
Thankful
Do not

481
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,593
Thank you, you gave me a new life

482
01:01:25,116 --> 01:01:28,776
From today's new life and my dignity
Everyone is at your disposal

483
01:01:30,724 --> 01:01:32,390
I'm tired of being a nurse

484
01:01:32,931 --> 01:01:36,555
I want to be free
To stay free

485
01:01:47,027 --> 01:01:49,024
Do you know who to make a deal with?

486
01:01:49,291 --> 01:01:51,408
... I chose from your ship on your behalf

487
01:01:51,844 --> 01:01:54,677
It's when they have the English
They were drowning in water

488
01:01:55,558 --> 01:01:59,687
It is true that the name is foreign (foreign)
But I will not play the game

489
01:02:09,114 --> 01:02:10,257
Are you scared?

490
01:02:10,704 --> 01:02:13,371
Honestly, we're afraid of anything

491
01:02:14,222 --> 01:02:16,167
But be with you
We also learn courage

492
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,870
I'll learn you very quickly, sir

493
01:02:34,571 --> 01:02:37,425
From the rest of the time, you are also liberating

494
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:40,160
take this

495
01:02:40,546 --> 01:02:41,546
!Excellency

496
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:55,277
I do not see the girl I saved

497
01:03:48,198 --> 01:03:49,548
You still wake up?

498
01:03:50,633 --> 01:03:52,114
I told you to sleep

499
01:03:52,597 --> 01:03:54,763
I wanted to sleep

500
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,356
... but that's it

501
01:03:57,488 --> 01:03:59,451
... this is not going to sleep

502
01:04:00,408 --> 01:04:03,248
... when you were born

503
01:04:06,853 --> 01:04:10,546
Mr. Mirza gave me this
... and told me

504
01:04:11,477 --> 01:04:15,868
"Protecting Dafai from today is your duty."

505
01:04:16,544 --> 01:04:17,720
.I know

506
01:04:18,908 --> 01:04:23,295
Do you feel I still need to protect?
No, no, no

507
01:04:23,586 --> 01:04:26,958
But this show did not spoil me for sleep

508
01:04:28,583 --> 01:04:30,528
Do you want to be awake for the rest of your life?

509
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:34,128
... One day I close my eyes

510
01:04:35,511 --> 01:04:37,646
And I sleep in full comfort

511
01:04:37,814 --> 01:04:42,849
I fall so deep into sleep
I do not wake up with no sound

512
01:04:44,285 --> 01:04:45,970
Even if i give you my voice?

513
01:04:50,309 --> 01:04:52,180
... with your voice

514
01:04:53,272 --> 01:04:55,959
I'll be back in hell

515
01:05:06,717 --> 01:05:08,218
Baba

516
01:05:09,434 --> 01:05:12,112
I'll give you this very day

517
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:36,004
... in the courtyard of the house

518
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:44,314
Pine tree ...

519
01:05:49,857 --> 01:05:52,630
My little girl ...

520
01:06:07,944 --> 01:06:10,257
A good place to hide somewhere

521
01:06:10,323 --> 01:06:12,593
But a road should be here

522
01:06:13,568 --> 01:06:15,619
The sea is here

523
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:42,863
.. I knew from the beginning

524
01:06:43,483 --> 01:06:46,260
You want to grab me

525
01:06:46,579 --> 01:06:49,116
What did you look for
A way out of here?

526
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,447
I was doing with you
I would be outrageous

527
01:06:55,705 --> 01:06:57,221
I'm also awesome

528
01:06:57,657 --> 01:06:59,799
how are you ?

529
01:07:00,042 --> 01:07:01,352
I do not trust you

530
01:07:01,828 --> 01:07:02,977
Two reasons

531
01:07:03,332 --> 01:07:05,850
One, that I'm so sweet

532
01:07:06,204 --> 01:07:07,675
It tells me all

533
01:07:08,078 --> 01:07:10,191
The second is Khodabakhsh

534
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:13,016
Also known as Freedom

535
01:07:13,739 --> 01:07:14,518
what do you mean?

536
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:18,664
I feel there is a problem between you

537
01:07:20,067 --> 01:07:22,727
Maybe you want to be a leader of the group

538
01:07:23,215 --> 01:07:24,518
Khodabakhsh also trusted me

539
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:27,734
But you are
I feel like you betray me

540
01:07:28,113 --> 01:07:29,866
The truth is that you do not trust me

541
01:07:30,228 --> 01:07:33,267
I put the weapon on my shoulder and put it

542
01:07:33,615 --> 01:07:35,086
It's free

543
01:07:36,863 --> 01:07:39,093
Why do not you trust me?
Foolish girl

544
01:07:42,693 --> 01:07:45,775
Next time, such a thing goes to the mind
I'm rolling my neck

545
01:07:46,881 --> 01:07:48,232
Ok, I do not mind

546
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:50,308
I close my mouth
The discussion is over

547
01:07:50,647 --> 01:07:51,647
what did you say?

548
01:07:51,886 --> 01:07:56,103
I heard that bypassing the seven seas
If you save the lives of someone

549
01:07:56,422 --> 01:07:57,989
Eternal friendship arises

550
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,592
The day you die for liberation
The friendship itself arises

551
01:08:07,026 --> 01:08:09,215
I do not think so for my father

552
01:08:34,858 --> 01:08:37,433
Why do you want energy?

553
01:08:37,842 --> 01:08:40,679
Nothing grows on this land
- if so what?

554
01:08:41,101 --> 01:08:43,750
Two years old has not grown, how is it now?

555
01:08:43,963 --> 01:08:44,963
I put it right there

556
01:08:44,988 --> 01:08:47,924
Eat hungry
Thirsty Drink

557
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:56,416
Is this free too?

558
01:08:57,052 --> 01:09:00,603
Farming is all of us

559
01:09:01,174 --> 01:09:04,888
I lost my land
Instead of plowing the soil, I got a sword

560
01:09:05,203 --> 01:09:07,403
It's as if someone does not trust your agricultural power

561
01:09:07,702 --> 01:09:08,981
I can help?
-Not

562
01:09:09,249 --> 01:09:10,847
This is my job

563
01:09:11,275 --> 01:09:13,018
I just do it myself

564
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,295
What did you plant now?

565
01:09:15,803 --> 01:09:16,803
Royaam

566
01:09:17,515 --> 01:09:18,682
Free dream

567
01:09:19,024 --> 01:09:20,897
Freedom that I believe

568
01:09:21,686 --> 01:09:24,782
I want people to have a good power

569
01:09:26,536 --> 01:09:31,973
I say that there is no need to be dare to get involved
We should be happy a little

570
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:34,932
What happiness is higher than freedom?

571
01:09:36,759 --> 01:09:38,757
How do you want to change your loneliness?

572
01:09:39,327 --> 01:09:43,000
Change one
Everyone changes

573
01:09:43,528 --> 01:09:45,904
Of course, if the human is so close

574
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:55,114
In every human's life
... At least one opportunity to get that

575
01:09:55,431 --> 01:09:58,682
Which will cross its weakness
And toward luck

576
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:01,744
And bless the best

577
01:10:03,425 --> 01:10:08,130
Change his personality
Get better off of yourself

578
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,324
I believe in that

579
01:10:14,759 --> 01:10:18,400
I do not know how to handle you
Or are you scared?

580
01:10:19,666 --> 01:10:21,579
This is my fear of you

581
01:10:22,582 --> 01:10:23,773
Why?

582
01:10:24,673 --> 01:10:26,802
Because i trusted you

583
01:10:32,006 --> 01:10:33,464
Are you garb

584
01:10:34,736 --> 01:10:36,827
You are an enemy

585
01:10:40,994 --> 01:10:43,560
... But when I look at you, I feel

586
01:10:44,822 --> 01:10:49,210
I see a worrying man
Looking for something

587
01:10:52,795 --> 01:10:54,594
It will follow its path

588
01:10:55,878 --> 01:10:58,997
Find a free one

589
01:11:03,019 --> 01:11:07,260
Maybe I'll be your free bridge

590
01:11:11,418 --> 01:11:14,785
And it only tells you the time
That you are my greatest discovery

591
01:11:15,484 --> 01:11:17,387
. Or my biggest mistake

592
01:11:35,655 --> 01:11:37,207
Think it

593
01:11:37,731 --> 01:11:38,945
.I thought

594
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:53,148

Where are we going

630
01:17:10,573 --> 01:17:15,167
A realm of this close proximity
Helps us secretly

631
01:17:20,054 --> 01:17:24,461
King of the Circumpolar, Sir Samangar Singh
Our help is ours

632
01:17:25,104 --> 01:17:27,321
For the English speaking, it breeds opium

633
01:17:28,164 --> 01:17:30,089
... our troops

634
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,869
Have a lot of courage
But they have little weapons

635
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,500
Today we compensate for it a little

636
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:42,678
All the paths end there
Get scattered

637
01:17:43,435 --> 01:17:45,831
No one should understand

638
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:50,101
Which is free in Garagaur

639
01:17:55,891 --> 01:17:57,851
Somebody gave him a gift

640
01:18:11,444 --> 01:18:13,450
Do you remember what you mean?

641
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:16,043
How can i forget, honey

642
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,829
But what do you do among people?

643
01:18:20,356 --> 01:18:24,343
I do not trust the syndrome
So I'm worried

644
01:18:25,066 --> 01:18:28,510
I see! Ok go me

645
01:18:28,757 --> 01:18:29,757
Finger!

646
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:32,422
Did not you get any news?

647
01:18:36,075 --> 01:18:37,888
... the news I do not have

648
01:18:44,154 --> 01:18:46,171
But I found a free man

649
01:18:55,645 --> 01:18:57,990
I just have a request
Blood and bleeding

650
01:18:58,337 --> 01:19:00,283
Get your business and office

651
01:19:00,554 --> 01:19:02,741
And make sure I can escape

652
01:19:03,737 --> 01:19:06,116
After pointing me
You run away

653
01:19:06,291 --> 01:19:09,400
I am the only one who
I know you are working for us

654
01:19:09,931 --> 01:19:12,015
Unreasonable martyr Nashi open

655
01:19:12,265 --> 01:19:13,728
I am not ready to be martyred by my father

656
01:19:14,581 --> 01:19:16,583
Where is freedom

657
01:19:17,243 --> 01:19:18,243
Sangram

658
01:19:18,752 --> 01:19:20,476
My brother Khodabakhsh

659
01:19:20,946 --> 01:19:23,184
I finally met with you

660
01:19:24,573 --> 01:19:25,923
How are you guys

661
01:19:26,016 --> 01:19:28,142
I got a gun and a gun

662
01:19:29,135 --> 01:19:31,747
Now let's make you cool

663
01:19:32,127 --> 01:19:33,762
Destruction disappears

664
01:19:34,295 --> 01:19:37,834
Your friends are yours
Liberates himself

665
01:19:37,985 --> 01:19:42,511
The sooner you have to fight
And eliminate Clive

666
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:45,767
Sick, we're miserable

667
01:19:46,223 --> 01:19:47,683
Soldiers Understanding us here

668
01:19:47,985 --> 01:19:50,089
What are you doing sangram
You listen

669
01:19:50,532 --> 01:19:52,572
For my friend, I'll give you that
Do not go out

670
01:19:52,856 --> 01:19:55,698
... but the sigram
This is the safest place for you

671
01:19:56,112 --> 01:19:57,924
I'm coming back to them

672
01:20:25,801 --> 01:20:31,880
Intagram Bollywood Van
Instagram.Com/Bolly1official

673
01:20:56,008 --> 01:20:57,160
We got into trouble

674
01:20:57,627 --> 01:21:00,549
Saw, we were surrounded by four sides

675
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:03,567
I would not be like that

676
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:05,282
I was surprised

677
01:21:07,638 --> 01:21:09,932
How much did you sell me

678
01:21:16,814 --> 01:21:18,369
Do you miss your time?

679
01:21:34,124 --> 01:21:35,872
I'm deceived in my blood

680
01:21:37,305 --> 01:21:39,144
And your trust is my blood

681
01:21:50,458 --> 01:21:52,873
From here, one survives

682
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:02,577
What did you think
God?

683
01:22:02,923 --> 01:22:06,402
Do you think you can change the fate of someone?
Or herself?

684
01:22:07,562 --> 01:22:09,297
There is nothing in this world

685
01:22:12,259 --> 01:22:14,642
I can not make myself a better guy
I do not need it

686
01:22:14,870 --> 01:22:17,396
I'm working
I'm happy

687
01:22:20,592 --> 01:22:23,885
Do not look that way
Nothing, nothing changes

688
01:22:24,019 --> 01:22:25,769
No, I'm not you and not my destiny

689
01:22:32,313 --> 01:22:35,187
Some people can not stop the company

690
01:22:35,285 --> 01:22:37,288
I do not accept slavery

691
01:22:37,379 --> 01:22:39,076
surrender
Stay alive

692
01:22:39,158 --> 01:22:41,583
!look there

693
01:22:46,092 --> 01:22:48,630
You thought you came
Who will capture Maro alive?

694
01:22:58,291 --> 01:23:00,151
!Fire

695
01:23:39,041 --> 01:23:41,540
Khodabakhsh

696
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:44,430
! Yeah

697
01:23:46,428 --> 01:23:49,450
Come back to me, my doll

698
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:57,431
Come on ahead of me

699
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:16,076
Come on in the silver or silver apron

700
01:24:28,884 --> 01:24:31,630
Good for a few days

701
01:24:33,304 --> 01:24:37,936
... but you will not be injured in your wound

702
01:24:39,979 --> 01:24:42,108
It will not be good forever

703
01:25:12,137 --> 01:25:17,272
We should not leave now
Have a calm for a moment

704
01:25:18,172 --> 01:25:22,165
Sleep, pride and smile

705
01:25:22,688 --> 01:25:24,623
We take it all out

706
01:25:27,265 --> 01:25:29,364
... I swear to God

707
01:25:29,808 --> 01:25:32,013
... I do not rest from now

708
01:25:32,797 --> 01:25:35,223
So when Clive is in black soil

709
01:25:35,722 --> 01:25:38,395
. She wants to enslave her soul

710
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:41,603
We release her from life

711
01:25:42,295 --> 01:25:45,152
Liberty

712
01:25:45,765 --> 01:25:48,647
Liberty

Free

714
01:26:26,365 --> 01:26:28,193
How are you doing it

715
01:26:29,705 --> 01:26:31,822
Ram Clavan, okay?

716
01:26:37,411 --> 01:26:40,119
Hello sir
What are you up to here, Fyrgy?

717
01:26:42,126 --> 01:26:44,844
I came to win my prize

718
01:26:45,273 --> 01:26:47,034
I do not see you coming

719
01:26:47,715 --> 01:26:49,202

01:26:56,187 --> 01:26:57,908
I'm your sweetheart, sir

722
01:26:58,431 --> 01:27:00,857
Between flattery and respect
There is a lot of difference

723
01:27:01,093 --> 01:27:02,363
I'll make Hero Taro, sir

724
01:27:02,655 --> 01:27:06,439
Honestly, our main goal
See you here

725
01:27:06,755 --> 01:27:09,847
You will receive a prize

726
01:27:10,354 --> 01:27:11,354
I have to go now

727
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,942
I know, sir, you made a great celebration

728
01:27:14,371 --> 01:27:19,355
But I have some news
You are astonished at hearing

729
01:27:19,638 --> 01:27:20,852
what's up?

730
01:27:21,766 --> 01:27:23,838
If you say, my belly is empty

731
01:27:24,837 --> 01:27:28,189
Have something to eat
The news comes out

732
01:27:58,028 --> 01:28:00,257
You've done the cartoon

733
01:28:00,934 --> 01:28:02,063
... I did

734
01:28:02,706 --> 01:28:07,521
After giving a prize
I'm on your way, you go to your own way

735
01:28:09,061 --> 01:28:11,142
To say this
Did you keep all this?

736
01:28:12,513 --> 01:28:13,876
get lost

737
01:28:16,431 --> 01:28:18,980
You go there

738
01:28:23,153 --> 01:28:26,792
Sacrifice, do not freeze

739
01:28:29,731 --> 01:28:32,903
Impossible
I saw myself

740
01:28:33,382 --> 01:28:34,382
Right?

741
01:28:34,539 --> 01:28:35,741
Purpose?

742
01:28:36,455 --> 01:28:38,168
Dead

743
01:28:39,233 --> 01:28:41,349
But it's free

744
01:28:42,298 --> 01:28:43,988
Keep my head in my head

745
01:28:45,951 --> 01:28:47,889
Freedom is not human

746
01:28:48,708 --> 01:28:50,832
Freedom is a mindset
One goal

747
01:28:51,154 --> 01:28:52,727
Think of a disease

748
01:28:53,345 --> 01:28:55,667
Anyone can get it

749
01:28:56,143 --> 01:28:58,398
One will kill 100 people

750
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:02,898
Freedom is in the hearts of the people, as God is hanging

751
01:29:03,676 --> 01:29:06,787
So your concern should not be ruined yet

752
01:29:07,261 --> 01:29:10,848
You're still in danger
Perhaps more than before

753
01:29:11,204 --> 01:29:13,550
I told you to come and tell him

754
01:29:14,304 --> 01:29:16,123
Where is this free army?

755
01:29:18,638 --> 01:29:20,208
Sorry sir
... but

756
01:29:20,208 --> 01:29:24,252
I heard the company have a land of 200 hectares in Kissing

757
01:29:25,519 --> 01:29:29,641
And you know who this is
There are fifty thousand gold coins, much respect for him

758
01:29:30,005 --> 01:29:31,005
is not it?

759
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:32,960
The price is not high?

760
01:29:33,644 --> 01:29:36,800
I'm selling my name, sir
Please do not leave it

761
01:29:37,088 --> 01:29:38,088
... fingers

762
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:41,236
.I accept

763
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:06,518
Free Army Map

764
01:30:13,842 --> 01:30:17,132
My fool's partner is in your prison

765
01:30:17,816 --> 01:30:21,435
You have given him so much food right now
How do I get there?

766
01:30:21,578 --> 01:30:25,554
Try to escape this time
Otherwise both of you were killed

767
01:30:26,235 --> 01:30:29,156
...Sir
Very good

768
01:30:34,126 --> 01:30:35,659
You were with us

769
01:30:37,059 --> 01:30:38,807
We do not forget

770
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:45,851
Q: What do you mean by bitch in English?

771
01:30:46,704 --> 01:30:50,238
Hromosadeh
"I am happy to meet you."

772
01:30:50,618 --> 01:30:52,429
We have two or three rounds

773
01:30:54,654 --> 01:30:56,534
Move your dear master

774
01:30:57,842 --> 01:30:59,895
These are very beneficial

775
01:31:00,449 --> 01:31:03,906
And their wine does not speak

776
01:31:07,131 --> 01:31:10,557
Are you fine or bad?

777
01:31:11,312 --> 01:31:14,557
I'm good and bad
I love you

778
01:31:15,937 --> 01:31:17,646
He is the most important

779
01:31:17,899 --> 01:31:20,383
Or you are so big or too bitchy

780
01:31:21,058 --> 01:31:23,021
I am a great observer

781
01:32:07,826 --> 01:32:09,080
He was his signal

782
01:32:09,477 --> 01:32:13,093
All people go to the sign

783
01:34:03,913 --> 01:34:06,500
!turn around

784
01:34:21,794 --> 01:34:25,953
Come on!

785
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:34,356
Be brave

786
01:35:45,056 --> 01:35:46,563
Color

787
01:36:53,128 --> 01:36:57,306
The card was not correct
Do you deceive us

788
01:36:59,399 --> 01:37:02,352
The boiler tells the pot that it's black

789
01:37:03,452 --> 01:37:06,937
I was scolded by many because of you

790
01:37:07,196 --> 01:37:09,444
I gave you a bit of food tonight

791
01:37:11,648 --> 01:37:16,921
Go to Clive, tell the faith of a Hindu
It's not a shame that we'll break apart after eating

792
01:37:18,101 --> 01:37:20,396
.. ours takes the enemy's neck

793
01:37:20,633 --> 01:37:23,612
And as long as his last breath fails
His neck does not go away

794
01:37:26,825 --> 01:37:29,397
Thank you, bye
Two missing three

795
01:37:46,865 --> 01:37:51,126
Free

796
01:37:53,331 --> 01:37:57,758
Fiery
Fiery

797
01:37:58,883 --> 01:38:05,386
Finger!
Finger!

798
01:38:05,607 --> 01:38:08,648
Sinichar

799
01:38:16,669 --> 01:38:18,040
We saved hell

800
01:38:20,139 --> 01:38:22,734
Now this is my life

801
01:38:23,218 --> 01:38:25,195
... even if I miss me too, I have no problem

802
01:38:25,629 --> 01:38:30,277
Now that I understand the meaning of self-esteem
I will never let her go

803
01:38:30,721 --> 01:38:32,520
.Thank you very match

804
01:38:33,714 --> 01:38:35,587
I'm yours

805
01:38:38,862 --> 01:38:41,162
You made me lose the wrong path in life

806
01:38:56,254 --> 01:38:58,864
What is your self esteem now, when do you think?

807
01:39:00,522 --> 01:39:03,082
You're gonna kill me

808
01:39:04,669 --> 01:39:08,331
So Figuer showed us the wrong map

809
01:39:10,414 --> 01:39:12,831
I thought you would trust her

810
01:39:13,515 --> 01:39:15,751
I trusted me most

811
01:39:16,602 --> 01:39:19,289
So I got a new snake

812
01:39:19,829 --> 01:39:21,145
!very good

813
01:39:21,916 --> 01:39:23,339
I was wrong, sir

814
01:39:23,551 --> 01:39:25,623
False mistake

815
01:39:27,307 --> 01:39:29,606
And you will be punished by the felony

816
01:39:30,828 --> 01:39:36,517
We do not know where to hide it
Where to arrest him?

817
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:45,489
Where do you get me?
let me go

818
01:39:59,658 --> 01:40:01,883
How are you mad

819
01:40:05,283 --> 01:40:09,173
Still, you're a friend of mine
Do you think of fiction?

820
01:40:31,079 --> 01:40:32,665
Call me?

821
01:40:45,406 --> 01:40:48,674
I thought about you wrong

822
01:40:51,246 --> 01:40:54,292
That I did not trust you
It was my mistake

823
01:40:55,304 --> 01:40:58,537
Succeeding in your courage

824
01:40:58,727 --> 01:40:59,967
.that was my fault

825
01:41:02,090 --> 01:41:03,633
I'm angry now

826
01:41:05,541 --> 01:41:09,913
I've come to the extreme
If I can not, I can not be kind

827
01:41:11,618 --> 01:41:13,196
So I grew up, what would I do?

828
01:41:13,903 --> 01:41:18,778
Clive, Revenge and the House
Except for this, I did not think anything

829
01:41:19,293 --> 01:41:24,143
It's not blood in the bloodstream, it's poison
And this is the poison of my power

830
01:41:26,690 --> 01:41:30,230
But maybe that's not all violence

831
01:41:38,487 --> 01:41:40,200
The sword is free

832
01:41:41,492 --> 01:41:43,948
Today you are one of my people

833
01:41:44,722 --> 01:41:46,974
... This is a sign of trust and belief

834
01:41:48,337 --> 01:41:49,707
And there is a friendship between us

835
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:59,630
... Today it is your duty to do this

836
01:42:01,947 --> 01:42:04,428
And it's the duty of our friend

837
01:43:37,470 --> 01:43:40,997
You do not need to be so angry
What I was supposed to do

838
01:43:41,304 --> 01:43:43,997
Done?
Clive cried out

839
01:43:44,015 --> 01:43:46,444
What do you want now

840
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:51,607
... Frankly speaking

841
01:43:52,319 --> 01:43:55,130
My goodies are coming to an end

842
01:43:55,581 --> 01:43:58,634
That's why I have to go from here

843
01:43:59,291 --> 01:44:02,202
Be it, i'm talking about you

844
01:44:02,822 --> 01:44:05,006
Do not trust people

845
01:44:05,434 --> 01:44:09,326
What if we go back to our hometown?
come here

846
01:44:10,059 --> 01:44:12,513
Goodbye I'm short

847
01:44:12,932 --> 01:44:16,359
I'm afraid that a bitch would come out of me again

848
01:44:16,359 --> 01:44:19,260
"Walk Anywhere"
"It's a misfortune for the rest"

849
01:44:34,451 --> 01:44:37,338
"No one believes that something grows here"

850
01:44:38,028 --> 01:44:42,106
"Make a silver change, everyone changes it"

851
01:45:13,770 --> 01:45:15,072
! Yeah

852
01:45:15,556 --> 01:45:17,063
! Do not

853
01:45:17,753 --> 01:45:19,078
! Yeah

854
01:45:19,403 --> 01:45:21,111
what has happened?

855
01:45:24,586 --> 01:45:26,511
The ships of the company attack us

856
01:45:26,584 --> 01:45:29,746
They are attacking us
hurry up

857
01:45:38,762 --> 01:45:41,838
We can arrest most of them, sir

858
01:45:42,365 --> 01:45:44,407
What
Surrender to themselves

859
01:45:44,697 --> 01:45:47,218
Who said this?

860
01:45:47,864 --> 01:45:51,622
Hit them all

861
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:04,156
! All out!

862
01:46:13,243 --> 01:46:15,754
Take the baby out

863
01:46:27,783 --> 01:46:29,290
Hurry up go

864
01:46:35,189 --> 01:46:36,228
hurry up

865
01:46:36,267 --> 01:46:39,456
Be fast, we have to go soon

866
01:47:20,708 --> 01:47:24,179
You saved me
If you did not, everybody would not be aware of it

867
01:47:25,725 --> 01:47:29,628
My master savior is not
One more time

868
01:47:45,664 --> 01:47:51,696
Translator: Yassin
A presentation of the Bollywood Web site

869
01:47:57,518 --> 01:48:00,179
New misery
Go ahead and solve it

870
01:48:03,863 --> 01:48:06,849
Why are you all alive?
Eat daddy

871
01:48:07,154 --> 01:48:09,392
Come on, Jaythin B.

872
01:48:13,887 --> 01:48:16,428
That is Soraya

873
01:48:17,023 --> 01:48:19,286
Sorry, we are unaware

874
01:48:19,657 --> 01:48:21,099
Wedding caravan Edward

875
01:48:23,811 --> 01:48:25,643
Soraya John is very humorous

876
01:48:25,764 --> 01:48:28,210
Come here, see what I've come up with

877
01:48:31,302 --> 01:48:32,917
First, bring down the voice

878
01:48:33,004 --> 01:48:35,823
What did you think about yourself?
Do you like to eat food?

879
01:48:36,133 --> 01:48:38,915
Poor you are in trouble

880
01:48:39,448 --> 01:48:43,520
When you lie
First of all, I notice it

881
01:48:43,652 --> 01:48:44,916
When did I lie?

882
01:48:45,169 --> 01:48:48,380
You are in a hurry to be a passenger
- We came for help

883
01:48:49,321 --> 01:48:51,910
But you must know
Who you help

884
01:48:52,155 --> 01:48:53,155
.. I'll explain them

885
01:48:53,209 --> 01:48:57,744
We are a free army
To give us a bonus

886
01:48:59,036 --> 01:49:01,286
Sustenance is equal to death with us

887
01:49:01,550 --> 01:49:04,096
This is not the case
Say a word

888
01:49:05,813 --> 01:49:07,511
Thank you for your greatness

889
01:49:08,199 --> 01:49:10,395
But why should I help you?

890
01:49:10,653 --> 01:49:13,817
Because Clive is in the rush
Set up a great celebration

891
01:49:14,582 --> 01:49:17,180
Because this celebration will not be done without you

892
01:49:18,304 --> 01:49:21,890
And this is the last place for us
To reach Clive

893
01:49:24,957 --> 01:49:28,732
True or False
It is your decision

894
01:49:33,735 --> 01:49:35,501
Slavery is not good for anyone

895
01:49:36,144 --> 01:49:38,796
Not for the insiders, nor for the aliens

896
01:49:40,159 --> 01:49:44,860
But what are you doing?
Heart and dance

897
01:49:51,095 --> 01:49:53,983
I love drooling with dreams

898
01:49:56,869 --> 01:49:57,987
...Anyway

899
01:49:58,282 --> 01:50:02,578
There is a rush
... We must blow the raven (devil)

900
01:50:03,373 --> 01:50:05,877
She also gets warm

901
01:50:30,043 --> 01:50:34,007
... Mr and Mr Clive

902
01:50:35,162 --> 01:50:41,994
We came to you
Show our performance

903
01:50:42,250 --> 01:50:44,251
... The difference is that

904
01:50:44,958 --> 01:50:52,350
Seeing this, maybe your eyes
Swinging does not have any other beauty

905
01:50:54,633 --> 01:50:56,647
Let him know

906
01:50:57,347 --> 01:51:03,665
... because sometimes, by seeing our tribute, people give them their lives

907
01:51:32,428 --> 01:51:36,226
Today's celebration is very magnificent

908
01:51:36,685 --> 01:51:41,192
Tomorrow is a great success
When it overcomes badly

909
01:51:46,013 --> 01:51:50,636
... Rawani, who until this day did not care

910
01:51:51,447 --> 01:51:53,294
Death will end

911
01:51:55,464 --> 01:51:58,024
But who is this devil?

912
01:51:59,244 --> 01:52:03,090
In Ronapur today, one
Devil is Ravan

01:53:18,251 --> 01:53:23,988
Together with the head of the rave
The head of this killer will be shaken

.. Ravan is your own soil

924
01:53:33,021 --> 01:53:35,267
And we know him from childhood

925
01:53:35,371 --> 01:53:39,760
But in recognizing your mutilated person
We were very negligent

926
01:53:41,110 --> 01:53:43,966
... in this circle

927
01:53:44,458 --> 01:53:48,112

02:00:26,124 --> 02:00:27,671
Meanwhile, my name is foreign (foreign)

978
02:00:27,814 --> 02:00:30,346
Look carefully, my look is like it

979
02:00:30,944 --> 02:00:36,247
Sacred, looks like in our previous world
We had a relationship with each other

980
02:00:36,665 --> 02:00:40,630
You were our father
And we have your basket

981
02:00:45,852 --> 02:00:47,128
...Sir

982
02:00:47,467 --> 02:00:49,584
I am the whole army

983
02:00:50,364 --> 02:00:55,670
This is not just an award
What are you telling her in English?

984
02:00:55,814 --> 02:00:57,632
Medal ! Dude

985
02:00:57,973 --> 02:00:59,934
This is the time to give me a medal

986
02:01:09,647 --> 02:01:11,457
Keep it safe

987
02:01:11,581 --> 02:01:13,471
It is very dangerous

988
02:01:17,633 --> 02:01:18,716
Finger!

989
02:01:19,217 --> 02:01:21,018
Have you been chatting

990
02:01:23,215 --> 02:01:24,895
... Say something, Duffy

991
02:01:26,077 --> 02:01:28,818
Man must always have hope for deception

992
02:01:30,668 --> 02:01:35,159
Two things left
Death and deceit

993
02:01:36,394 --> 02:01:39,707
For everyone in this life
Once upon a time there is going to be

994
02:01:42,951 --> 02:01:47,377
Thank you, you do not know
... where you are sitting

995
02:01:47,773 --> 02:01:50,652
This is the realm you are dealing with

996
02:01:51,177 --> 02:01:54,634
I do not have a heir, he's Duffy

997
02:01:56,549 --> 02:01:59,726
The only daughter of Mirza Sikendar

998
02:02:03,242 --> 02:02:05,248
He's dead

999
02:02:09,083 --> 02:02:10,703
!very good

1000
02:02:14,482 --> 02:02:17,590
All the killers are under one roof

1001
02:02:21,187 --> 02:02:24,582
Why did you deceive him?

1002
02:02:24,864 --> 02:02:28,599
Sir, I said
I bring you the whole army of freedom

1003
02:02:29,175 --> 02:02:30,863
Just do not forget your Maro Award

1004
02:02:31,595 --> 02:02:34,733
Mr. Mirza is right, fingers

1005
02:02:35,248 --> 02:02:40,861
The greatest enemy of a Hindus
Is a Hindu man

1006
02:02:41,090 --> 02:02:44,189
Mr. Mirza was right
But you are wrong

1007
02:02:45,409 --> 02:02:48,296
Sir
Sorry, my little mouth moves a lot

1008
02:03:02,808 --> 02:03:05,093
You sit down

1009
02:03:08,289 --> 02:03:11,336
The name of Mr. Clive should be
Was gracious

1010
02:03:12,278 --> 02:03:14,200
... they have to say that

1011
02:03:14,668 --> 02:03:17,654
The life of Zafira is now in your hands

1012
02:03:22,059 --> 02:03:24,388
You have to do a little work

1013
02:03:25,393 --> 02:03:30,025
Anyone who has done anything for free now

1014
02:03:30,614 --> 02:03:34,998
... or in her heart, she is crazy about working with her

1015
02:03:35,299 --> 02:03:38,750
Give us your voice

1016
02:03:41,809 --> 02:03:48,913
Only save Zanara and Zafira
That's just that

1017
02:03:52,596 --> 02:03:57,599
If not, that is free from your eyes
Tomorrow will not exist at all

1018
02:04:04,900 --> 02:04:06,125
! Now cut off!

1019
02:04:06,441 --> 02:04:10,968
Bride delicious delicious Clive Prison
Take another

1020
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:22,719
What are you made of?
Even hell is not the way for you

1021
02:04:24,513 --> 02:04:27,707
Shut up two, bitch

1022
02:04:45,882 --> 02:04:48,989
! Yeah

1023
02:04:52,439 --> 02:04:54,861
That's all because of Dfieura

1024
02:04:55,165 --> 02:04:57,716
I do not really understand Hindu Hindi

1025
02:04:58,096 --> 02:04:59,514
... capture them all

1026
02:04:59,878 --> 02:05:01,212
And duffy

1027
02:05:02,230 --> 02:05:03,533
... morning

1028
02:05:05,483 --> 02:05:07,153
Let him be executed

1029
02:05:35,173 --> 02:05:38,655
who are you?
I'm brave, open it

1030
02:05:42,707 --> 02:05:46,936
Come to eat all the sweets
We celebrated

1031
02:05:47,298 --> 02:05:49,373
We went for all the sweets

1032
02:05:49,773 --> 02:05:52,466
Give everyone a go
Yeah

1033
02:05:52,668 --> 02:05:54,450
They are glad

1034
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:57,362
Eat and take it

1035
02:06:03,211 --> 02:06:07,133
Comrade is not a good game
I wanted to give you one too

1036
02:06:07,592 --> 02:06:11,479
But why do I wear it
So take a look

1037
02:06:32,054 --> 02:06:33,553
Hello, sir

1038
02:06:35,455 --> 02:06:36,665
Do you eat sweets

1039
02:06:36,779 --> 02:06:39,375
It's nice
Everyone is eating

1040
02:06:40,716 --> 02:06:44,453
You look like that
It's as if you want to eat instead of sweets

1041
02:06:46,114 --> 02:06:48,716
Come on, go on, take it

1042
02:06:48,965 --> 02:06:50,223
Let us talk

1043
02:06:51,347 --> 02:06:53,071
Uncle, the point is that

1044
02:06:53,793 --> 02:06:56,485
I know you're angry at me

1045
02:06:57,826 --> 02:07:01,498
There is a lot of difference between talking and acting

1046
02:07:02,156 --> 02:07:04,799
I say something
But I do something else

1047
02:07:06,603 --> 02:07:11,033
You have asked me to be careful about Zafira and my disciples

1048
02:07:11,525 --> 02:07:13,623
... God, so far, I have not done so hard

1049
02:07:14,185 --> 02:07:17,128
It's unlike the essence
May God have mercy

1050
02:07:17,459 --> 02:07:19,259
Whatever I had done

1051
02:07:19,784 --> 02:07:21,731
But I was fooling myself

1052
02:07:22,511 --> 02:07:25,129
But I saw him later

1053
02:07:25,381 --> 02:07:27,192
I'm sure I'm back

1054
02:07:27,996 --> 02:07:29,821
Otherwise, I would have gone the right way

1055
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:32,876
I had forgotten my destiny
I saw you myself

1056
02:07:33,358 --> 02:07:38,648
To give a story of sweets to
Do you have that big?

1057
02:07:39,604 --> 02:07:41,037
Give me somebody

1058
02:07:41,465 --> 02:07:43,042
Do you eat

1059
02:07:43,134 --> 02:07:45,636
I told you

1060
02:07:45,934 --> 02:07:48,079
I miss the poison

1061
02:07:48,409 --> 02:07:49,706
!help yourself

1062
02:07:51,419 --> 02:07:53,690
!no no no

1063
02:07:54,261 --> 02:07:56,531
Wow!

1064
02:07:57,076 --> 02:07:59,460
I will take a sweet
And you attack me

1065
02:08:02,369 --> 02:08:04,986
The warrior within you is still alive

1066
02:08:05,363 --> 02:08:07,696
Even with the bracelet, you'll find a way

1067
02:08:08,186 --> 02:08:11,146
You are not afraid of death
So death does not come close to you

1068
02:08:11,935 --> 02:08:16,057
And I am so, that I even fear life
And I have to deceive

1069
02:08:18,145 --> 02:08:22,545
But today is not our life
But it's about your death

1070
02:08:22,973 --> 02:08:27,552
Just wanna do me with zobont?
Or another weapon?

1071
02:08:34,213 --> 02:08:35,776
I have time weapons

1072
02:08:37,536 --> 02:08:40,333
We do not have a bigger weapon

1073
02:08:41,991 --> 02:08:44,909
.. I told you that

1074
02:08:45,577 --> 02:08:50,121
At 10:05 your card will expire

1075
02:08:52,850 --> 02:08:56,244
I kidnapped Mr. Clive's clock
But I can not read it

1076
02:08:56,903 --> 02:09:00,559
You will take the time
The rest of me with me, I'll take a minute

1077
02:09:08,492 --> 02:09:13,447
At least I die with my own sword

1078
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:15,772
You look at the clock

1079
02:09:37,248 --> 02:09:38,751
It was time to act

1080
02:09:38,926 --> 02:09:43,259
Jayton's magic syrup worked badly

1081
02:09:44,438 --> 02:09:46,800
We came to kill Clive

1082
02:09:47,162 --> 02:09:50,712
But when I saw you
My mind was working

1083
02:09:52,435 --> 02:09:54,578
... and thought to me

1084
02:09:55,197 --> 02:10:00,365
All your people are in prison

1085
02:10:01,485 --> 02:10:04,734
You also said, "When we are together, we are free"

1086
02:10:06,180 --> 02:10:08,217
But i am not

1087
02:10:09,101 --> 02:10:10,101
What

1088
02:10:10,339 --> 02:10:11,669
I'm not free

1089
02:10:12,317 --> 02:10:15,148
Do not do this, I know your name is God-loving

1090
02:10:15,435 --> 02:10:19,590
I say, my hand is closing
I am not free now

1091
02:10:20,752 --> 02:10:24,418
... and if you speak a second word

1092
02:10:24,878 --> 02:10:26,658
I'm crazy

1093
02:10:26,965 --> 02:10:30,121
I'm annoying you, uncle

1094
02:10:41,412 --> 02:10:43,195
What's are you waiting for?

1095
02:10:43,646 --> 02:10:45,843
Want to invite you to embrace?

1096
02:10:46,356 --> 02:10:47,994
!Sir

1097
02:11:00,014 --> 02:11:01,414
! Yeah

1098
02:11:02,858 --> 02:11:04,103
! Yeah

1099
02:11:06,515 --> 02:11:10,176
What are you doing crazy?
Hear my story

1100
02:11:10,858 --> 02:11:13,170
Every time I tell you the truth
You miss me

1101
02:11:13,484 --> 02:11:15,460
Flip, do not talk a word

1102
02:11:15,512 --> 02:11:17,399
We do not have time to talk

1103
02:11:24,914 --> 02:11:26,234
You are back

1104
02:11:27,015 --> 02:11:30,727
The goal is so bad

1105
02:11:33,362 --> 02:11:35,724
I needed to go back to hell

1106
02:11:38,366 --> 02:11:40,956
Which fool you taught you?

1107
02:11:42,935 --> 02:11:47,052
Do not forget this
And I'm bunny

1108
02:11:49,246 --> 02:11:53,264
I reminded you
You understand yourself

1109
02:11:54,572 --> 02:11:57,983
There is a tunnel here
... that goes straight to

1110
02:11:58,118 --> 02:12:00,581
All people are here
We are all and everyone

1111
02:12:00,725 --> 02:12:03,574
You will move as fast as possible
And give Clive a lesson

1112
02:12:03,844 --> 02:12:04,844
veto?

1113
02:12:05,454 --> 02:12:07,514
I've got a lot of pain on the stomach

1114
02:12:08,984 --> 02:12:12,112
you do not worry
I'll rest right here

1115
02:12:19,388 --> 02:12:22,368
It's one hundred percent
There is no reason for your chest

1116
02:12:22,684 --> 02:12:25,356
Until I martyred
You do not get two

1117
02:12:26,615 --> 02:12:31,733
I knew that your wickedness was fleeting

1118
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:33,341
Are you drunk

1119
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:35,663
I ate one of your sweets

1120
02:12:35,949 --> 02:12:38,676
Fool, how are you going to fight now?

1121
02:12:38,945 --> 02:12:42,642
Freedom has its own way
I know how we go

1122
02:12:44,444 --> 02:12:46,381
We all die

1123
02:12:53,986 --> 02:12:57,125
People say when you go to war
Forget about everything

1124
02:12:57,369 --> 02:13:00,593
But today must be the whole past
Remember

1125
02:13:02,524 --> 02:13:07,293
Clive we've loved so much
It's our turn now to compensate

1126
02:13:07,304 --> 02:13:10,168
Before the fight

1127
02:14:27,191 --> 02:14:28,973
!be ready

1128
02:15:38,102 --> 02:15:39,535

1131

Get my ship out

1132
02:16:26,173 --> 02:16:27,559
You go up

1133
02:16:41,073 --> 02:16:42,447
! Yeah

1134
02:16:53,601 --> 02:16:56,403
Do not shoot me, sir

1135
02:16:56,630 --> 02:16:58,451
I have little kids

1136
02:16:58,735 --> 02:17:01,379
You know how much I hate fighting

1137
02:17:01,644 --> 02:17:04,242
Now I'm lost in front of your eyes
-it's enough

1138
02:17:04,819 --> 02:17:07,253
Fooling us and yourself is enough
No sir

1139
02:17:07,408 --> 02:17:10,168
In your life for the first time in the right direction
You stepped

1140
02:17:12,068 --> 02:17:13,779
On the same track, stay tuned

1141
02:17:16,285 --> 02:17:18,484
Thank you, Indian, from the water

1142
02:17:18,847 --> 02:17:22,341
Inside you are like Hindi
But outside, a little outside is a model

1143
02:17:56,383 --> 02:17:57,859
Finger!

1144
02:18:23,623 --> 02:18:26,427
You really can not trust you

1145
02:18:26,726 --> 02:18:28,899
You are not the right guy, really

1146
02:18:29,214 --> 02:18:31,751
You got the Hindi with a closed cognitive hand

1147
02:18:32,266 --> 02:18:35,071
Now enjoy the power of their hands

1148
02:19:23,189 --> 02:19:26,594
Do not miss the ship

Stay alive

Dfiera asked: where is Firogy?

1164
02:25:43,428 --> 02:25:45,752
No, he is now a leader

1165

New people are new people

1166
02:25:48,857 --> 02:25:50,706

Not
Yeah

1172
02:26:59,160 --> 02:27:03,338
Even after figuring out
You stole it

1173
02:27:06,142 --> 02:27:09,019
Come on, follow you on the door

1174
02:27:09,417 --> 02:27:11,739
It seems to be following you

1175
02:27:12,287 --> 02:27:16,475
I brought him a victory
I saved my life

1176
02:27:17,576 --> 02:27:20,350
Anyway, I took it from myself
-that's a lie

1177
02:27:20,632 --> 02:27:21,632
I swear to my grandmother

1178
02:27:21,681 --> 02:27:24,682
What do you swear
I swear to live or swear to die

1179
02:27:24,950 --> 02:27:27,445
How long have you been honest?

1180
02:27:29,345 --> 02:27:32,500
She liked
You could be king

1181
02:27:32,902 --> 02:27:34,519
I would be your minister

1182
02:27:34,785 --> 02:27:37,766
But no, you're my destiny
It's time to spend time with you

1183
02:27:38,080 --> 02:27:41,828
Look, comrade, marriage is the death of love

1184
02:27:42,833 --> 02:27:45,083
And the relationship between the two sides must be equal

1185
02:27:46,633 --> 02:27:48,710
Between me cum
See where is Zofira

1186
02:27:48,774 --> 02:27:50,853
That's not the case
Do not think yourself

1187
02:27:50,865 --> 02:27:53,839
I'm so big
I'm telling you that

1188
02:27:54,324 --> 02:27:55,324
Color

1189
02:27:56,406 --> 02:28:00,050
Again, we again became friends with Fab

1190
02:28:00,582 --> 02:28:02,814
I'm so glad to hear that

1191
02:28:02,854 --> 02:28:05,160
No one should be friends with us

1192
02:28:05,451 --> 02:28:07,476
What are you thinking about?

1193
02:28:12,652 --> 02:28:15,153
Cum says
He hurts you

1194
02:28:17,916 --> 02:28:19,475
Let me take it into account

1195
02:28:42,256 --> 02:28:45,239
Soraya, are you here?

1196
02:28:50,475 --> 02:28:52,388
I'm glad to see you

1197
02:28:52,413 --> 02:28:55,666
When you stole all my jewelry
I had no other choice

1198
02:28:56,006 --> 02:28:57,284
Hello

1199
02:28:59,718 --> 02:29:02,123
I did not hurt
I just borrowed you

1200
02:29:03,366 --> 02:29:07,635
Anyway, the beauty of a woman
It's a shame

1201
02:29:07,999 --> 02:29:09,987
What do you know about shame and hilarity?

1202
02:29:10,273 --> 02:29:13,752
Shame on your language
She is shameless

1203
02:29:15,046 --> 02:29:18,799
When you beat you
I'm happy to be happy

1204
02:29:22,001 --> 02:29:24,957
I do not hear that, dear sir

1205
02:29:28,297 --> 02:29:32,622
If you say your love is over
To sail

1206
02:29:32,862 --> 02:29:34,533
Where to go

1207
02:29:38,809 --> 02:29:39,902
Let's go Kolkata

1208
02:29:40,288 --> 02:29:42,251
What He said we were going to school

1209
02:29:42,742 --> 02:29:44,865
We're not going to have a colloquette

1210
02:29:44,907 --> 02:29:47,625
Why Calcutta, is it there?

1211
02:29:48,013 --> 02:29:50,904
I want to buy from my site

1212
02:29:51,007 --> 02:29:52,607
Fiery, where are we going?

1213
02:29:53,652 --> 02:29:55,949
... where they say hello to him

1214
02:29:56,336 --> 02:30:00,317
And just no Thuraya
But other dancers dance

1215
02:30:00,912 --> 02:30:04,504
Let's get two, you work
Take the bell, let's go

1216
02:30:05,763 --> 02:30:08,400
Loose shirt and tight pants

1217
02:30:15,906 --> 02:30:19,631
Friends, our ship goes straight to
England

1218
02:30:19,722 --> 02:30:21,748
They say they are British too

1219
02:30:22,462 --> 02:30:26,003
These white wreckage loot
... it's our turn now

1220
02:30:26,772 --> 02:30:32,304
I swear to the grandmother that if in a few months
I do not kidnap my country, I do not mention it

1221
02:30:32,933 --> 02:30:34,588
Long live the gods!
