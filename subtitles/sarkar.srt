1
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:10,943
Sarkar..

2
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:18,207
..he was my daughter Shaalu's..

3
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:21,280
..friend in the college.

4
00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:24,948
That.. that Bhooshan.

5
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:26,959
I want to meet Sarkar.

6
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,956
That night, after his college party..

7
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:38,294
..on the pretext of
offering her a lift home..

8
00:02:41,374 --> 00:02:43,968
..he got her to sit in his car.

9
00:02:44,044 --> 00:02:47,241
And on his way..

10
00:02:47,314 --> 00:02:53,310
..that Bhooshan..

11
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:55,513
..he ruined my Shano's..

12
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:02,990
..he raped her.

13
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:17,505
I went to the police..

14
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:25,547
..and like a fool I
approached the court.

15
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:31,023
But the police and court
made a mockery of her.

16
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:41,028
They accused my
daughter of being loose..

17
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:47,199
..and that she did all of
this for her greed of money.

18
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:04,221
My Shaalu could not
bear this humiliation..

19
00:04:07,394 --> 00:04:11,228
..and she.. my
daughter killed herself.

20
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:24,603
These people convinced the court..

21
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:33,075
..that my daughter..

22
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:35,087
..was not mentally sound.

23
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:57,102
Sarkar.. I had only
one child.. just one..

24
00:04:57,177 --> 00:04:59,441
..and she too..

25
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:16,288
Before I die, you get me her revenge.

26
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:23,125
My dead daughter's revenge..

27
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:27,133
Next time when this
gentleman hears that person's name..

28
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:29,141
..it should bring a
smile on his face.

29
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,134
I don't want to know
'who' that person is.

30
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:00,298
Bhooshan, Bandra..

31
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:01,635
What.. what did you say?

32
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,176
Bhooshan..

33
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:07,670
Bandra, Carter Road..

34
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:11,717
Bungalow No. 14.

35
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:16,186
Its good we came here..

36
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:18,190
Otherwise we wouldn't
have had the chance to meet.

37
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,588
Can we give you a lift home?.

38
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:23,458
Come on! - That girl in
red dress belongs to me.

39
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:33,204
Bhooshan!

40
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:47,210
Your name is Bhooshan?

41
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:48,547
So?

42
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:52,553
This guy is going to
get real good and hard.

43
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:56,821
Anyone who interferes will
meet with the same fate.

44
00:06:58,565 --> 00:07:03,229
Decide, do you want
to stay back or go?

45
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:05,633
Hey, who the hell are you?

46
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:09,500
Oh my God!

47
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:11,237
Please do something.
- Oh my God!

48
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:15,643
Bhooshan! What.. what are you doing?

49
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:17,580
Hey get aside..

50
00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:21,242
Hey.. move back..

51
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:28,251
Stand straight.

52
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:33,259
Stretch him down..

53
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,262
Take this, break him up..

54
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,269
Not on his head, he will die.

55
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:43,769
Break his leg.

56
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:46,275
Break his hands..

57
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:49,275
..and his limbs.. ..now his back..

58
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:52,284
Hey, what are you looking at?

59
00:07:52,552 --> 00:07:54,611
Haven't got any work?
C'mon, mind your own business.

60
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:57,283
Flog him..

61
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,287
Hit him here.. hit him there..

62
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,830
'Govinda.. Govinda'

63
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:17,470
'Govinda.. Govinda'

64
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:20,309
Hello, Rathod saab!

65
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,311
Yes, I am fine, how about you?

66
00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:24,780
He is in his prayers.

67
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:26,318
I will ask him to call

68
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:27,646
yes..

69
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,315
Yes.. yes..

70
00:08:33,493 --> 00:08:35,324
I am fine..

71
00:08:36,596 --> 00:08:37,722
..you tell me.

72
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:40,992
What to say,
Subhash! There's a problem.

73
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:45,332
What use is the
Chief Minister's post..

74
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:47,839
..if your problems persist?

75
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:52,334
Khurana may perhaps be
right in what he thinks..

76
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:56,007
..but where will these people
go if they lose their homes?

77
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:57,344
To the sea?

78
00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:01,510
Subhash, I do get your point.

79
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:08,356
But Khurana considers
your sympathy for the poor..

80
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:11,363
..to be just a cover to
nurture criminal elements.

81
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:13,757
I don't stop anyone from thinking.

82
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,357
I stop them from 'doing'.

83
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:18,702
I value your point of view..

84
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:21,968
..but even I am
answerable to my seniors.

85
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,372
And I, to my people.

86
00:09:26,646 --> 00:09:28,580
I have prepared this
sweet Subhash bhai.

87
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:31,581
Oh, I just finished my breakfast.

88
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:33,647
Have a little, at least.

89
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,381
Kaka (uncle), how is my dress?

90
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:38,783
Is it new?

91
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:40,382
No.. its old.

92
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:44,391
What question is this, Kaka?

93
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:45,522
Obviously, it is a new one.

94
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:46,656
I bought it just yesterday.

95
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:47,859
Why? Anything special today?

96
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:50,801
Of course it is something special!
'He' is coming today.

97
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:53,804
Who? Oh, Shankar.

98
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:08,750
Hey, Shankar.

99
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:13,422
How are you?
- Very fine.

100
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:15,884
Chandar.. Pooja! This is Chandar.
Works with my dad.

101
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:17,429
Greetings!

102
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:26,432
Hi daddy! Yes, I've reached.

103
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:37,046
I have come with him.

104
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,447
What does his father do?

105
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,646
Actually.. I don't really know.

106
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:43,450
His name is Subhash Nagre.

107
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,861
Subhash Nagre? Where did
you find his son? - Means?

108
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:52,625
Do you know who
this Subhash Nagre is?

109
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:55,993
He is the city's topmost gangster.

110
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:06,478
How are you?

111
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:27,832
Am I some little girl to
eat chocolates? - Of course.

112
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:36,898
What's this? I won't
understand head or tail of it.

113
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,500
It's very simple, papa.

114
00:11:38,678 --> 00:11:42,512
What simple? Kaka can't
even handle a TV remote.

115
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:44,513
That Shinde's men are up
to their tricks again.

116
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:46,843
I insisted on setting
them right then and there.

117
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,683
Had we done so, they wouldn't be
showing their real colours now.

118
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:52,789
I know how to deal with Shinde.

119
00:11:53,926 --> 00:11:56,121
But what to do with
your high pitched voice?

120
00:11:58,531 --> 00:11:59,793
You think this to be some joke?

121
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:04,701
No, I'm not joking. Come..

122
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:11,133
Look, first send Gaitonde to Shinde.
Then come and inform me.

123
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,007
Bhabhi, where is brother?

124
00:12:14,947 --> 00:12:16,539
He's gone for his shoot.

125
00:12:58,758 --> 00:13:02,125
Cut, ok! Print 2 and 4!

126
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:06,598
How are you, sir?

127
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:09,125
How are you, Star? Come, sit.

128
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:13,605
What 'star', sir? It's you who
has provided me with this break.

129
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,100
What break, eh?

130
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:23,012
Am I crazy to put
money on any newcomer?

131
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:25,608
Thank you, sir.

132
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:30,949
Thank you, sir?

133
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,615
What?

134
00:13:37,897 --> 00:13:39,626
You have what it takes, got it?

135
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,630
Thank you sir.

136
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:46,105
And stop applying lipstick.

137
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:47,230
You look prettier than the heroine.

138
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:48,637
Well.. no, sir!

139
00:13:58,718 --> 00:14:00,652
How are you?

140
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:06,819
Wow! It's so pretty! For your wife?

141
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:09,986
For you.

142
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:14,191
Thanks, Vishnu-ji!

143
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:17,930
But how can I accept it?
It's so expensive.

144
00:14:18,004 --> 00:14:19,869
Keep it.
- But..

145
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:20,997
Keep it!

146
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:36,349
Didn't I ask you to keep it?

147
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:48,695
I will leave now.

148
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:51,698
My brother has arrived from America.

149
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:55,096
Else would have
taken you out for dinner.

150
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:11,117
What was he saying? What's this?

151
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,886
He's given this gift to me.
What should we do with this now?

152
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:16,890
What can we do to such ruffians?

153
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,198
I feel like strangulating him!

154
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:23,735
Despite having a
child he acts so filthy.

155
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:29,738
Brother, how is Anoop?

156
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:31,069
as usual.

157
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:34,743
And how about Vishram-ji?

158
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:39,951
He's joined Rathod's party.
- Madan Rathod?

159
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,749
Who else?

160
00:15:45,024 --> 00:15:46,082
Why?

161
00:15:47,426 --> 00:15:48,916
Baba chucked him out here.

162
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,158
Should I feed him then?

163
00:15:52,231 --> 00:15:53,755
But that Vishram.. he
turned out to be a sly guy.

164
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:58,099
Got kicked here on the rear..

165
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,762
..and landed straight to
the legislative assembly.

166
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:01,099
Bloody bastard!

167
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:08,774
Vishnu, how many times
have I asked you to..

168
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:12,784
..keep your filthy tongue in check,
in front of the kid?

169
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:17,181
I am talking to you..

170
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:23,790
..in what language would
you like me to explain?

171
00:16:25,298 --> 00:16:27,994
Does anything go into
that thick head of yours?

172
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:40,807
Why did you go to that
builder's place at Worli?

173
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,074
He was acting smart,
which made me go there.

174
00:16:42,148 --> 00:16:43,274
With whose permission?

175
00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:45,078
Am I supposed to take your
permission for everything?

176
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:47,813
Are you responsible enough
to handle work on your own?

177
00:16:49,288 --> 00:16:50,812
You.. please finish your food first.

178
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:54,025
Child, have another serving..
- No.

179
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:56,023
Have some.
- I said no mother.

180
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:57,824
What are you getting angry at me?

181
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:00,827
You have become so stubborn!

182
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:05,368
Have your food, please.

183
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:13,005
Can I call you back? Thanks. Bye.

184
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:27,850
Sarkar, Silver Mani had called.
wants to meet you tomorrow.

185
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:48,870
Hi Pistol! How are you?

186
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:56,217
Hey baldy! One gets hair oils
abound in the market. Try them.

187
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:58,881
Greetings, Khan Saab.

188
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,893
I explained to Surendra..

189
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:04,896
..in lighter matter you would
find Silver Mani acting comic..

190
00:18:04,964 --> 00:18:08,058
..but in serious matters..
it's only murder!

191
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:14,897
The game ends! And so
does the story! That's it!

192
00:18:15,975 --> 00:18:17,237
Chiku, dear..

193
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:22,914
No tea! No coffee! No cold drinks!
I will have food here.

194
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:27,916
Your are embarrassing me, Mani seth!

195
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:31,582
What seth? You are the lord, Sarkar!

196
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:33,251
Shankar!

197
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:39,391
You must have met my son.

198
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:43,094
How could I? He always stays abroad.

199
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:45,931
I am Silver Mani!
Style from the South..

200
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:47,939
..Operations, complete North!

201
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:51,940
Tell me, Mani, what brings you here?

202
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:59,279
Those union guys had come to me.

203
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:05,550
Telecom project! To ask for
bonded labour from Hyderabad.

204
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:06,955
I had warned them..

205
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,955
I know, Sarkar. But I
thought honesty isn't..

206
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:15,967
..the best policy
in today's politics.

207
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:18,964
We will suffer losses!

208
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:21,973
Mani, how many times have
I explained this earlier..

209
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,976
..that while counting
the short term gains..

210
00:19:25,044 --> 00:19:28,241
..one shouldn't lose sight
of the long term damages.

211
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:36,978
What did I say?

212
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,321
I said the same, Sir!

213
00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:44,988
Let it go.. we'll
bear the humiliation.

214
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:48,990
I repeatedly tell this to everyone..

215
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:53,164
..my style is South but
operations are complete North!

216
00:19:55,274 --> 00:19:57,003
I have learnt this from you.

217
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:05,181
One minute. Sarkar,
there is something more.

218
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:08,014
Hey, call that boy.

219
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:12,515
This boy Mahesh.. he
is an excellent actor.

220
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:17,023
You know so many film folks.
Get him something..

221
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:19,030
I don't interfere in others' work.

222
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:22,033
Don't you know?

223
00:20:26,372 --> 00:20:29,307
What did I say? I said the same.

224
00:20:33,445 --> 00:20:38,212
Talk to Vishnu! He might
have something for you.

225
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:42,384
Going again?
- What else should I do?

226
00:20:42,555 --> 00:20:44,386
Staying back will mean hearing
that oldster's nonsense again.

227
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:47,391
He is your father!
- Hey..

228
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:56,059
Stop favoring him! It's me
who had brought you here.

229
00:20:57,136 --> 00:20:59,070
Dare not forget it!

230
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:10,408
Yeah, Vishram!

231
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:14,412
C'mon, bark!

232
00:21:14,486 --> 00:21:16,249
Vishnu, why are you
talking like this to me?

233
00:21:17,356 --> 00:21:20,086
You know I have a problem
with Sarkar and not with you.

234
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:23,254
You have always been my
friend and will remain so.

235
00:21:23,362 --> 00:21:26,354
Ok, now! Stop this drama.
How's your work going?

236
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:29,432
I make double the
amount in half the work.

237
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:35,436
What type of a man this Rathod is?

238
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:40,101
He's a complete idiot and that makes
working with him all the more fun.

239
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:41,505
We've been taking
him for a royal ride..

240
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,706
..and he doesn't
seem to even realise it.

241
00:21:44,383 --> 00:21:46,112
How's your film going on?

242
00:21:47,386 --> 00:21:50,583
First class! Will be a block buster!

243
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:53,115
You think that hero
of yours will work?

244
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:57,128
And that heroine?

245
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:14,142
Any progress with her?

246
00:22:16,415 --> 00:22:18,144
Hey.

247
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:26,152
How's your brother?

248
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,155
Returned after having a nice
time in America. What else!

249
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,324
Heard of him having an
affair with that Modi's daughter?

250
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,696
What are you saying?

251
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:41,171
The whole world knows of it.

252
00:22:45,244 --> 00:22:48,304
And what about that girl? Avanti?

253
00:22:48,514 --> 00:22:50,175
Who Avanti?

254
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:53,184
Sawant's daughter!
He is father's friend.

255
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,647
He had promised him..

256
00:22:56,722 --> 00:22:58,587
..on his deathbed..

257
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:03,192
..that Shankar will
be married to Avanti.

258
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,361
His mother and daughter are at home..

259
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,206
Poor Sarkar!

260
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,211
What will Sarkar do?

261
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:30,215
What can we do in such matters?

262
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:39,220
Pushpa..

263
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:47,230
I had given my word to Sawant that..

264
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:51,571
Anyway..

265
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:57,242
What about Avanti, then?

266
00:24:00,586 --> 00:24:02,247
I will talk to her.

267
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,257
Where is Shankar?

268
00:24:07,593 --> 00:24:10,255
Shankar, if you don't mind,
Can I ask you a question?

269
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:16,797
Yup.
- What does your dad exactly do?

270
00:24:18,604 --> 00:24:20,265
What do you mean by that?

271
00:24:21,673 --> 00:24:23,265
He helps people!

272
00:24:23,342 --> 00:24:25,810
Helps? Means?

273
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:31,276
Help means if someone
comes to him with a problem..

274
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,444
..he makes it his own problem.

275
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:38,279
Shankar, whenever I see
his photograph in some..

276
00:24:38,357 --> 00:24:40,291
..newspaper or magazine..

277
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:44,455
..there are always gunmen
standing beside him. Why?

278
00:24:44,696 --> 00:24:46,288
Security.

279
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:49,798
Security? But why
would he have enemies?

280
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:55,563
Pooja, when one takes a stand..

281
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:57,370
..he is bound to convert the
other person into his enemy.

282
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:01,312
But Shankar, who your
father is, after all..

283
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,314
..to fight on behalf of others?

284
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:10,313
One doesn't need an
Appointment letter to impart justice.

285
00:25:11,723 --> 00:25:14,317
You mean, your dad
considers himself to be above..

286
00:25:14,393 --> 00:25:16,486
..the police and the law?

287
00:25:18,797 --> 00:25:21,823
He doesn't think so. Millions
of his admirers think that way.

288
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:27,494
You know, my dad doesn't
think highly of your dad.

289
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,334
Same here! My dad too doesn't
hold your dad in high esteem.

290
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:36,508
What do you mean? How can you
even make such a comparison?

291
00:25:36,815 --> 00:25:39,340
My dad is a legitimate businessman.

292
00:25:39,618 --> 00:25:43,349
The only difference between
your dad and mine is that..

293
00:25:43,422 --> 00:25:46,619
..your dad stays within the system
and works for his own profits..

294
00:25:46,692 --> 00:25:51,755
..while my dad stays out of the
system to work for others' benefit.

295
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:58,632
You mean to say that your
dad is a parallel government?

296
00:25:58,837 --> 00:26:00,964
If the meaning of
the government is to..

297
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,371
.. take care of people,
then he definitely is.

298
00:26:09,715 --> 00:26:13,708
Look Pooja, he is my dad.

299
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,381
I know him.

300
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,884
Whatever he does is for others' good.

301
00:26:23,862 --> 00:26:25,557
His ways are different..

302
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:29,926
..but neither is he a criminal..

303
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:32,664
..nor does he keep
connections with the criminals.

304
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:39,939
Okay.
- Okay.

305
00:26:44,483 --> 00:26:46,417
Rasheed wants to meet you.

306
00:26:47,753 --> 00:26:49,414
Who Rasheed?

307
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:52,413
He belonged to the
Nayak gang earlier.

308
00:26:52,491 --> 00:26:54,584
Was involved in a couple of murders.

309
00:27:09,908 --> 00:27:12,775
He was in Bangkok and Nepal
for the past couple of years.

310
00:27:14,947 --> 00:27:16,710
Don't know what he wants from you.

311
00:27:25,991 --> 00:27:27,458
Call him.

312
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:07,890
Ask Preetam Seth to come and meet me.

313
00:28:25,517 --> 00:28:27,508
Wanted to talk to you alone.

314
00:28:28,687 --> 00:28:30,518
Consider that I am alone.

315
00:28:38,196 --> 00:28:41,529
My goods are expected to arrive..

316
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,797
..by Ship in Shikuti village.

317
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:50,931
And will continue to
arrive for at least two years.

318
00:28:52,044 --> 00:28:56,538
Now it is well-known that
nothing happens in this area..

319
00:28:56,615 --> 00:28:59,550
..without your permission.

320
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:07,715
So, we just wanted to
seek your blessings.

321
00:29:13,965 --> 00:29:16,957
You will get a couple of
millions on each consignment.

322
00:29:21,973 --> 00:29:24,100
20 Lakhs before the delivery.

323
00:29:29,915 --> 00:29:31,576
Look Rasheed..

324
00:29:33,852 --> 00:29:36,116
..I don't know what
you have heard about me.

325
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:46,588
I do agree that there are
certain things that I do..

326
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:49,924
..which can't be considered lawful.

327
00:29:51,002 --> 00:29:55,598
That's because I do
what I think is right.

328
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:02,605
It may go against God, the society..

329
00:30:04,616 --> 00:30:10,612
..the police, law or the
entire system for that matter.

330
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:19,153
Different people hold
different views about my work..

331
00:30:19,231 --> 00:30:22,894
..and they form an opinion about me.

332
00:30:26,705 --> 00:30:28,639
I will not do it.

333
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:31,969
Three million?

334
00:30:32,043 --> 00:30:33,977
Hey, you think we are on sale?

335
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:36,113
You know whom you are talking to?

336
00:30:37,716 --> 00:30:38,842
I mean..

337
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:40,646
Don't even try to explain

338
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:41,979
Rasheed.

339
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:46,046
I know what those goods are
and the reason of their arrival.

340
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,652
I will not do it.

341
00:31:23,295 --> 00:31:29,200
And listen, I will not
let you do it either.

342
00:32:12,143 --> 00:32:19,743
Khan Saab, whatever there is
worth knowing about this man..

343
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,751
..I want to know all that.

344
00:32:24,256 --> 00:32:28,090
Send a word to Savatya
to come and meet me.

345
00:32:36,268 --> 00:32:39,169
Your mother was saying that
you wanted to go back to America.

346
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:43,030
Yes. A friend and I are
planning to start a software company.

347
00:32:45,176 --> 00:32:46,768
Pooja is your friend's name, right?

348
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,774
When are you introducing us to her?

349
00:32:56,121 --> 00:32:57,782
Whenever you have the time.

350
00:33:05,463 --> 00:33:07,397
Savatya..

351
00:33:08,867 --> 00:33:09,959
..this Rasheed..

352
00:33:17,075 --> 00:33:20,476
..I am not happy with his ways.

353
00:33:32,557 --> 00:33:35,822
What? You will kill
Subhash Nagre? Will you?

354
00:33:36,895 --> 00:33:39,363
Just listen to what he says!

355
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:43,493
I haven't come all the way
from Dubai to narrate a joke.

356
00:33:45,904 --> 00:33:48,839
Rasheed Bhai, the whole of
Mumbai will burn in flames.

357
00:33:48,907 --> 00:33:50,841
I am not bothered about Mumbai.

358
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:54,841
One doesn't get business
worth 1000 million everyday.

359
00:33:56,915 --> 00:33:58,849
We will have to grab it.

360
00:33:59,918 --> 00:34:03,513
Even if that means killing
Sarkar or anyone for that matter.

361
00:34:05,323 --> 00:34:07,450
Vishram-ji, explain to him.

362
00:34:08,593 --> 00:34:10,356
He has arrived from Dubai
and is grossly unaware..

363
00:34:10,428 --> 00:34:11,861
..of the scheme of things in Mumbai.

364
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,455
Make him understand! Explain..

365
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:27,875
Have you locked your brains?

366
00:34:28,346 --> 00:34:30,405
Can't you understand?

367
00:34:35,053 --> 00:34:40,389
Ok! If you guys want to commit
this stupidity, sure, go ahead.

368
00:34:41,493 --> 00:34:43,893
If you want to jump in
the well, go ahead as well.

369
00:34:44,362 --> 00:34:48,389
But I am not a part of all this.

370
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:50,229
I am leaving.

371
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:55,235
I can't let this go out.

372
00:35:04,182 --> 00:35:07,515
Rasheed Bhai, I give you a
guarantee. My lips will remain sealed.

373
00:35:08,453 --> 00:35:10,444
I take an oath on my children,
Rasheed Bhai.

374
00:35:12,524 --> 00:35:15,322
You were right. I was
talking like a madman.

375
00:35:15,393 --> 00:35:17,918
I couldn't understand really. He
should.. he should be bumped off.

376
00:35:39,484 --> 00:35:42,419
A decision should be
made with choice..

377
00:35:44,022 --> 00:35:45,284
..and not under duress.

378
00:35:48,026 --> 00:35:54,363
Rasheed Bhai, we have Swami-ji's
message. He wants to meet you.

379
00:36:09,581 --> 00:36:14,143
Killing Subhash Nagre
and killing Sarkar..

380
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:17,655
..are two totally different things.

381
00:36:21,493 --> 00:36:25,156
Subhash Nagre is a mere human being.

382
00:36:27,665 --> 00:36:31,157
Sarkar is a thought, a philosophy.

383
00:36:33,738 --> 00:36:37,003
Before killing the man..

384
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:48,345
..it is imperative to
kill his philosophy.

385
00:36:53,091 --> 00:36:55,025
I didn't understand, Swami-ji.

386
00:36:59,097 --> 00:37:00,359
I will explain.

387
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,461
Swami-ji's thinking is great!

388
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:44,337
I haven't seen a more
intelligent person than him.

389
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:46,070
Who is this Savatya?

390
00:37:47,745 --> 00:37:49,576
He was enquiring about me.

391
00:37:50,148 --> 00:37:54,084
He is one of the closest aides
of Sarkar. Never take him lightly.

392
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:57,144
He can prove to be a step
ahead of us in these matters.

393
00:38:01,826 --> 00:38:03,760
What have I done?

394
00:38:03,828 --> 00:38:07,264
First you cheat and
to top it you lie.

395
00:38:07,565 --> 00:38:10,261
Why would anyone cheat? To win!

396
00:38:13,705 --> 00:38:15,570
Is winning so absolutely necessary?

397
00:38:17,175 --> 00:38:18,233
Yes.

398
00:38:19,711 --> 00:38:23,772
What if you have to lose someday?

399
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,579
Impossible.

400
00:38:27,652 --> 00:38:30,246
I don't mean the game. I mean life.

401
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:34,121
With Sarkar on my side,
how can I lose to anyone?

402
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,688
Welcome..!

403
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:13,754
Welcome, Mr. Rathod!

404
00:39:19,237 --> 00:39:22,172
Shankar, how are you?
- Fine.

405
00:39:23,675 --> 00:39:24,767
Hi!

406
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:28,778
Mr. Rathod, she is Pooja.
- Greetings.

407
00:39:29,714 --> 00:39:33,673
Greetings, Mr. Khurana!
What an honour. Welcome.

408
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:35,310
Please come.

409
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,684
Mr. Khurana, your
work couldn't be done.

410
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:44,251
Changing Subhash's
mind is almost impossible.

411
00:39:45,263 --> 00:39:51,725
I feel even Subhash's view
point is not totally wrong.

412
00:39:53,938 --> 00:39:57,203
Violence isn't a
solution to any problem.

413
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:05,215
A person who carries
his whims out by force..

414
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:10,814
..can prove to be
dangerous for the society.

415
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:16,883
Why should I fear?

416
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,631
This is the truth that ruffians
are being nurtured under the cover..

417
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:23,633
..of creating
housing for the deprived.

418
00:40:24,502 --> 00:40:29,405
And there is only one
person encouraging this.

419
00:40:30,575 --> 00:40:31,701
Subhash Nagre.

420
00:40:31,776 --> 00:40:36,577
Mr. Khurana thinks at your level.

421
00:40:43,855 --> 00:40:48,417
The public doesn't know
the real Subhash Nagre.

422
00:40:49,794 --> 00:40:55,664
Hence it reveres him.
Thinks him to be a Messiah.

423
00:40:57,335 --> 00:41:02,432
But according to me
he is just a hooligan.

424
00:41:04,342 --> 00:41:09,746
According to me, in a democracy..

425
00:41:09,814 --> 00:41:11,805
Even the public support
for him is on the rise.

426
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:13,942
That's why he is
jumping around like a frog!

427
00:41:14,886 --> 00:41:16,751
One tight smack will
set everything right.

428
00:41:16,821 --> 00:41:19,688
Sarkar, this man used to
know his limits previously.

429
00:41:19,757 --> 00:41:20,951
But now, he is out in the open..

430
00:41:21,025 --> 00:41:22,754
..giving interviews in the press,
television, everywhere.

431
00:41:26,364 --> 00:41:29,299
Pushpa, get some pickle, please.

432
00:41:44,816 --> 00:41:46,306
Mr. Khurana..

433
00:41:50,054 --> 00:41:51,316
..is a very nice man.

434
00:41:56,127 --> 00:41:57,651
It is very important
for a person like him..

435
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:08,329
..to live in this world.

436
00:44:43,894 --> 00:44:47,489
'Motilal Khurana's murder has
caused a sensation in the city.'

437
00:44:47,565 --> 00:44:51,501
'The only question
doing the rounds is..'

438
00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:55,505
'..who can get a non-violent and
popular figure like him killed?'

439
00:44:55,573 --> 00:44:58,974
'And now the weather update.'

440
00:44:59,043 --> 00:45:01,034
Any news about this?

441
00:45:07,118 --> 00:45:09,109
Everyone thinks you got him killed.

442
00:45:12,523 --> 00:45:16,186
Mama, my ice cream.
- Chicku, quiet.

443
00:45:26,604 --> 00:45:28,697
Do you also think
that I got him killed?

444
00:45:30,141 --> 00:45:31,199
No.

445
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:45,555
I am not the only one.
Everyone is saying this.

446
00:45:45,623 --> 00:45:46,954
Who everyone?
- The entire city.

447
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:52,221
Ask anyone and they say it
is your dad's handiwork.

448
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:55,155
A lie can't be made a truth just
because everyone is saying it.

449
00:45:57,635 --> 00:46:00,570
Just the way, without knowing the
facts, you have taken a decision..

450
00:46:00,638 --> 00:46:05,098
..in the like manner everyone thinks
that this is my dad's handiwork.

451
00:46:05,176 --> 00:46:06,575
Must be something,
otherwise how can..

452
00:46:06,911 --> 00:46:09,903
Just stop it, Pooja! Enough!

453
00:46:30,401 --> 00:46:31,925
Do you trust me?

454
00:46:35,806 --> 00:46:37,933
You cannot refuse the
fact that I know my dad..

455
00:46:38,008 --> 00:46:40,943
..better than anyone
else for that matter.

456
00:46:44,348 --> 00:46:47,784
If not him, trust me, at least.

457
00:46:51,222 --> 00:46:56,023
Suspecting him would mean
your casting aspersions over me.

458
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,960
Congrats!
- For what?

459
00:47:06,704 --> 00:47:10,640
I heard about Pooja and you.

460
00:47:11,976 --> 00:47:13,034
Oh!

461
00:47:13,711 --> 00:47:17,977
Shankar, you know that
I love you, don't you?

462
00:47:19,183 --> 00:47:20,377
Yeah.

463
00:47:20,451 --> 00:47:21,975
Since childhood.

464
00:47:26,724 --> 00:47:30,319
My mistake. I though even you would..

465
00:47:32,163 --> 00:47:37,260
That's fine. I am sure
she is very beautiful.

466
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:50,270
Avantika..
- Relax, Shankar.

467
00:47:51,148 --> 00:47:52,672
I have thought about
it all night long.

468
00:47:53,751 --> 00:47:58,017
And now.. it doesn't bother me.

469
00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:03,850
Really.. I swear.

470
00:48:10,768 --> 00:48:13,703
So, when are you
both getting married?

471
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,201
Thinking of marrying her.

472
00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:20,201
Whom?

473
00:48:20,778 --> 00:48:22,712
The heroine of that movie?

474
00:48:25,316 --> 00:48:26,715
Where is Vishnu now?

475
00:48:26,784 --> 00:48:28,718
Don't beat around the bush.
Tell me, what happened?

476
00:48:29,053 --> 00:48:31,248
Your film people are mocking at you.

477
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:34,116
Except you, everyone knows
what is cooking between..

478
00:48:34,191 --> 00:48:36,785
..the heroine and
the hero of the movie.

479
00:48:37,394 --> 00:48:42,058
Hey, stay in your limits
or else I will bump you off.

480
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:44,198
You will kill me, eh?

481
00:48:44,268 --> 00:48:47,328
I am being your well-wisher and
you are thinking of bumping me off?

482
00:48:48,339 --> 00:48:50,398
One shouldn't do good, these days!

483
00:48:50,808 --> 00:48:54,744
Look Vishnu, I have
the video tape.. shot..

484
00:48:54,812 --> 00:48:56,074
..in the make up van..

485
00:48:56,146 --> 00:48:57,408
..which features the hero and
heroine in compromising poses.

486
00:48:57,815 --> 00:48:59,749
I am sending that to you.

487
00:48:59,817 --> 00:49:03,810
Witness them and their
comments about you, for yourself?

488
00:49:04,355 --> 00:49:06,755
I know everything
about Vishnu, Swami-ji.

489
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:10,751
Your work will be done.

490
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:13,956
Two hundred percent.

491
00:50:24,902 --> 00:50:25,960
Hi.

492
00:51:10,414 --> 00:51:12,405
Doesn't matter how many
people would have been there.

493
00:51:12,483 --> 00:51:15,281
They all would know
he is Sarkar's son.

494
00:51:16,353 --> 00:51:18,412
Because everyone
knows he is Sarkar's son.

495
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:22,882
Nobody will testify against him.
- Even the heroine was scared of him.

496
00:51:24,395 --> 00:51:28,559
I don't know what sin
Subhash has committed.

497
00:51:30,501 --> 00:51:33,061
That he got such a son.

498
00:51:34,972 --> 00:51:37,907
Sir, he is his father
even in hooliganism.

499
00:51:37,975 --> 00:51:42,378
Yes, I know that you will
not believe me. I am sure.

500
00:51:42,446 --> 00:51:43,504
Sarkar has had Khurana murdered.

501
00:51:44,982 --> 00:51:47,917
I have told you many a times, you
people don't understand Subhash.

502
00:51:47,985 --> 00:51:49,919
Forget about his son.

503
00:51:49,987 --> 00:51:53,582
But Subhash isn't like this.

504
00:51:54,053 --> 00:51:56,749
When something doesn't happen
as you want, you do this too.

505
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:00,982
I..

506
00:52:02,061 --> 00:52:05,656
I know. You give justice.

507
00:52:06,131 --> 00:52:08,122
You have got a good reason.

508
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,259
Do whatever you want in the name of
justice. If I do that, it's injustice

509
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:12,600
Brother, you speak with respect.
You are speaking to Sarkar.

510
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,933
And who are you to
meddle in our matters?

511
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:16,600
Vishnubhai..
- Chandar..

512
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:19,600
Why don't you accept that
you committed a mistake?

513
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,612
What mistake, mother?

514
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,672
I made that kid, and behind my back..

515
00:52:25,217 --> 00:52:29,620
You told me to use power if I
have it, I did precisely that.

516
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:32,156
You will never
understand what power is, Vishnu.

517
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,785
Power is gained by making people one.

518
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,630
Not by dividing them.

519
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:44,101
Give this lecture to the people,
whom you have been fooling.

520
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:47,695
It will not work on me. - You are
crossing your limits, Vishnubhai.

521
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,704
Hey. What did I tell you?

522
00:52:50,976 --> 00:52:53,103
If you speak again, I will kill you.

523
00:52:53,178 --> 00:52:55,305
Tell this dog, I will kill him.

524
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,649
Vishnu..

525
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,844
Mother.. why..

526
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,650
You don't know this Chandar.
He does so many scams in work.

527
00:53:04,156 --> 00:53:06,989
I know the people who work here.

528
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:09,050
There.. he will
praise his servants now.

529
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:14,055
You.. I actually respect you.

530
00:53:14,133 --> 00:53:15,657
You think different from the world.

531
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:16,996
Just different.

532
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:20,334
If someone brings profit of lakhs,
you will drive him away.

533
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:21,668
Why?

534
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,332
Because we will be profited.
You cannot digest that.

535
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,673
You cannot do business, and
won't let us do business too.

536
00:53:26,011 --> 00:53:28,673
Vishnu, why are you making
a mountain of a mole hill?

537
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:32,342
Sarkar just asked you,
why did you kill that man?

538
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:35,012
Can I ask you, Khan. Why did
your Sarkar kill that Khurana?

539
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:36,679
Brother, be careful.

540
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:40,691
You keep quiet. You don't know
anything. You were there, abroad..

541
00:53:41,694 --> 00:53:44,356
What do you think?
Your father is a saint?

542
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,193
You don't know your father.

543
00:53:55,174 --> 00:53:56,368
Vishnu.

544
00:54:01,046 --> 00:54:04,982
Right now.. go away from this house.

545
00:54:11,056 --> 00:54:15,220
From today, don't commit the mistake
of being seen around this house.

546
00:54:18,063 --> 00:54:19,894
Go, get lost.

547
00:54:22,234 --> 00:54:25,226
Amrita. - Amrita and
Chicku will not go anywhere.

548
00:55:11,283 --> 00:55:15,049
Sapna. Subhash Nagre
is coming to meet you.

549
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,321
What did you do? What did you do?

550
00:55:57,996 --> 00:56:01,159
Are you crazy?

551
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:04,158
It is my mistake.

552
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:07,330
I should have known
what a hot head you are.

553
00:56:09,341 --> 00:56:11,002
You can do anything.

554
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:15,846
It would have been better
if I didn't send you the CD.

555
00:56:22,187 --> 00:56:24,018
That kid..

556
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,193
Till date.. I never..

557
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:47,201
..hurt any innocent person.

558
00:56:51,383 --> 00:56:53,544
And I have never
forgiven anyone who did that.

559
00:56:57,222 --> 00:57:01,386
Whoever he is.

560
00:57:06,565 --> 00:57:09,227
I have come to tell you today..

561
00:57:10,068 --> 00:57:13,231
You don't have to fear anyone.

562
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:17,241
It is my responsibility..

563
00:57:20,245 --> 00:57:22,509
..to look after your safety.

564
00:57:34,259 --> 00:57:38,423
Govinda..

565
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:47,436
Govinda..

566
00:57:58,483 --> 00:58:01,611
She has given a statement
against you with your father's support.

567
00:58:03,121 --> 00:58:05,612
And a warrant has
come out against you.

568
00:58:06,291 --> 00:58:16,292
The police can come here anytime. You
don't worry. I'll arrange everything.

569
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:32,214
Sarkar.. Khurana's
killer has been apprehended.

570
00:58:35,487 --> 00:58:37,478
Who is he?

571
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:39,456
His name is Ansari.

572
00:58:41,627 --> 00:58:43,322
Whom does he work for?

573
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:51,495
I don't know. He testified that you
gave him the orders to kill Khurana.

574
00:58:53,338 --> 00:58:59,334
And.. the home department.. has
taken out a warrant against you.

575
00:59:12,357 --> 00:59:13,688
Tell me, Madan.

576
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:15,693
Everyone was right about you.

577
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:18,696
I was a fool that I
didn't recognise you.

578
00:59:20,198 --> 00:59:23,258
Subhash, enough of your drama.

579
00:59:23,335 --> 00:59:26,361
I will see how you get away now.
1
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,443
Subhash Nagre has been accused
of being behind Khurana's death.

2
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:23,384
With this, not only
Khurana's supporters..

3
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:26,388
..even Nagre's supporters
are stunned.

4
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,123
They never thought
that Nagre would fall..

5
00:00:30,193 --> 00:00:32,127
..so low..

6
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:35,130
..in an attempt to show his power.

7
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:38,300
The commissioner S
P Pathak has said..

8
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:41,303
..that is the beginning of
the end of Nagre's hooliganism.

9
00:02:15,565 --> 00:02:17,226
He is coming.

10
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,631
Stop!

11
00:03:34,311 --> 00:03:35,801
Stop!

12
00:04:39,876 --> 00:04:42,037
There is a very big conspiracy.

13
00:04:45,382 --> 00:04:47,714
This is the beginning.

14
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:53,717
I committed the mistake.

15
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:57,716
It is my mistake.

16
00:04:58,561 --> 00:05:01,052
I couldn't see this coming.

17
00:05:05,702 --> 00:05:07,670
I don't want you to meddle in this.

18
00:05:07,737 --> 00:05:11,571
Therefore.. go back to
America as soon as possible.

19
00:05:22,752 --> 00:05:24,913
No, dad.

20
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:32,093
Don't worry about me. I
can take care of myself.

21
00:05:32,162 --> 00:05:33,925
But you don't know
anything about this..

22
00:05:33,997 --> 00:05:35,760
..and you aren't concerned with this.

23
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:39,097
Go back to America right now. Go.

24
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:43,764
Don't worry about me, dad.

25
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:48,767
I can take care of myself too.

26
00:05:53,683 --> 00:05:56,618
Yes, I know that I don't
know much about all this.

27
00:06:00,023 --> 00:06:02,014
But I have some responsibilities too.

28
00:06:51,174 --> 00:06:56,111
Chandar.. maybe you were right.
Rasheed is behind this.

29
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:02,173
But Sarkar gave Rasheed's work
to Savatya. What about that?

30
00:07:03,686 --> 00:07:06,177
I called him a couple of times,
he didn't take the call.

31
00:07:06,256 --> 00:07:08,520
I will go and see, myself.

32
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:37,883
Savatya..

33
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:41,885
Savatya..

34
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:24,593
We will kill that
Ansari in the lock up.

35
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,100
It will be stupidity.

36
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:28,262
What stupidity? Are we cowards?

37
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:30,272
Don't shout.

38
00:08:34,944 --> 00:08:37,276
You aren't the only
one who is worrying.

39
00:08:43,786 --> 00:08:48,223
Even if we touch Ansari, this fake
case against dad will turn true.

40
00:08:50,627 --> 00:08:56,122
You are right.
- Shankar.

41
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:19,151
I didn't come here to argue,
or hear your explanation.

42
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,324
Whatever is going on..
I cannot tolerate it.

43
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:44,346
Shankar, I love you. I
have full faith in you.

44
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,341
But I don't believe your family.

45
00:09:58,194 --> 00:10:00,287
I am going back to America.

46
00:10:03,032 --> 00:10:07,025
All I wanted to know is..
will you come with me?

47
00:10:17,046 --> 00:10:18,308
Pooja.

48
00:10:18,381 --> 00:10:21,043
Shankar, I just wanted to know.

49
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,720
No.

50
00:11:07,163 --> 00:11:08,425
Shankar..

51
00:11:08,931 --> 00:11:12,094
We got the news, Rasheed will
have Sarkar attacked in the prison.

52
00:11:28,117 --> 00:11:29,277
Who are you?

53
00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:33,288
I am Subhash Nagre's son, sir.
- So? - Dad is about to be attacked.

54
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:40,124
Your father is in prison. Where
else will he get better security?

55
00:11:40,196 --> 00:11:43,131
Sir, even you know
what happens in our jail.

56
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:44,461
My dad's life is in danger.

57
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:46,297
I wish that you take
some action immediately.

58
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,961
You are ordering me?

59
00:11:52,308 --> 00:11:53,468
Son, one doesn't do like this.

60
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:58,810
Because this isn't
your father's court.

61
00:11:58,881 --> 00:12:01,315
I didn't mean to say that, sir..

62
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:05,150
Forget it. Let him die if he has to.

63
00:12:08,157 --> 00:12:12,321
Actually, whatever he has sowed
till today, he will reap that!

64
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:16,855
Sir, why are you talking like this?

65
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:22,327
If you speak a lot..

66
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:26,341
I will wrench your tongue
out and give it in your hand.

67
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:34,180
Yes.

68
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:38,184
How much did you get?

69
00:12:46,362 --> 00:12:48,193
What did you say?

70
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:50,198
How much did you get?

71
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:59,535
Go, tell your father that I did this.

72
00:12:59,876 --> 00:13:02,367
Get lost.

73
00:13:07,383 --> 00:13:09,374
So, I was telling you..

74
00:13:15,057 --> 00:13:17,491
Meet them. Do whatever..

75
00:13:21,497 --> 00:13:27,231
Shankar.. only one man can
help us in this situation.

76
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:31,198
Silver Mani.

77
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:49,514
After dad's arrest, all of our
contacts are afraid to help us.

78
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:52,921
I don't even know
who is helping them.

79
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:57,930
We just got the tip that Rasheed
will have dad attacked in prison.

80
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,931
You have to do something, please.

81
00:14:00,002 --> 00:14:01,936
But son, what can I do?

82
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:10,935
Rasheed.

83
00:14:14,116 --> 00:14:15,947
What can I do?

84
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:19,112
Your father has gone crazy.

85
00:14:19,188 --> 00:14:22,351
He isn't earning, and
nor is he letting us earn.

86
00:14:22,558 --> 00:14:24,958
He has ruined all of us..

87
00:14:25,027 --> 00:14:27,291
..for the betterment of the people.

88
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:33,966
I swear to God.

89
00:14:34,136 --> 00:14:37,970
It is true that I came
up due to your father.

90
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,975
But even I have
some responsibilities.

91
00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:42,977
Even I have to serve the public.

92
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:45,970
I have my business,
my family problems.

93
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,982
And..

94
00:14:49,051 --> 00:14:51,315
What choice do I have?

95
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:52,977
Tell me.

96
00:14:53,055 --> 00:14:57,992
I told these people, you are
a kid, you can't do anything.

97
00:14:58,327 --> 00:14:59,988
But these people don't
want to take any chances.

98
00:15:00,663 --> 00:15:02,995
They don't want anyone
to try to take revenge.

99
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:07,160
You are a sweet boy.

100
00:15:09,605 --> 00:15:11,596
You are not guilty for all this.

101
00:15:11,674 --> 00:15:13,335
But you are trapped.

102
00:15:15,511 --> 00:15:19,003
Bad luck. Not yours, mine.

103
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:23,017
I feel very sad.

104
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:26,348
God bless you.

105
00:15:28,357 --> 00:15:30,018
Okay.

106
00:15:30,192 --> 00:15:33,025
Where will you kill
these people, Rasheed Bhai?

107
00:15:33,362 --> 00:15:36,195
Please don't kill them here.
Take them out.

108
00:15:36,265 --> 00:15:38,358
I can't see all this.

109
00:15:42,371 --> 00:15:45,033
Rasheed, help me once more.

110
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:49,037
For me and Sarkar's friendship.

111
00:15:50,112 --> 00:15:53,047
Clean bowl him.

112
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:56,044
Either the heart or
the brain, directly.

113
00:15:56,118 --> 00:15:58,052
Remember.

114
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,054
Don't let him bleed more.

115
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:05,053
I have to give this
concession to Sarkar.

116
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,119
Shoot.

117
00:17:06,288 --> 00:17:08,119
Run..

118
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,121
Run!

119
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:25,139
Govinda..

120
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:54,499
Govinda..

121
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:07,240
Govinda.

122
00:19:07,576 --> 00:19:15,244
Govinda..

123
00:19:26,762 --> 00:19:28,923
Come on.

124
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:43,606
Yes, tell me, Shankar.

125
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:45,770
See, Subhash Nagre will be attacked.

126
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:48,281
How do you know?
- There is no time for any questions.

127
00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:58,352
Quickly.

128
00:20:58,687 --> 00:21:01,349
Dad.

129
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:05,358
Get an ambulance.

130
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:09,363
Call a doctor.

131
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,450
We will not leave that Madrasi.

132
00:22:37,786 --> 00:22:40,448
We will shoot him today itself. -
Arrange for the security here first.

133
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,051
I had told you.

134
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:47,459
Sanyasi would have
brought the shooter.

135
00:22:47,796 --> 00:22:50,788
He would have aimed at the brain.

136
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:53,457
Just one bullet.

137
00:22:53,635 --> 00:22:56,798
One bullet. He would
have aimed at the brain.

138
00:22:56,972 --> 00:22:58,963
And Sarkar's
relation would be closed.

139
00:22:59,074 --> 00:23:01,474
What did you say?

140
00:23:01,643 --> 00:23:04,476
That he was a shooter from Dubai. Very
experienced. Olympic gold medallist.

141
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:08,481
Don't stare at me.

142
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,815
I will gouge your eyes out. This is
about Sarkar, this isn't child's play

143
00:23:13,822 --> 00:23:14,880
Hey..

144
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,489
This is about life and death.

145
00:23:16,825 --> 00:23:19,487
What did you think? He is Sarkar.

146
00:23:19,661 --> 00:23:22,095
He brought an L board
and aimed at Sarkar.

147
00:23:22,164 --> 00:23:25,827
I had said, Don't touch him. If you
touch him, he will go. Or we will!

148
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:27,493
Is it child's play?

149
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:29,503
Don't stare at me.

150
00:23:29,571 --> 00:23:31,835
Mani Seth, forget what happened.
Now, think about the future.

151
00:23:32,007 --> 00:23:34,032
What do I think of the future?
What do you know?

152
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:35,167
Shut up.

153
00:23:35,244 --> 00:23:38,111
See, I am being respectable to you,
you speak with me with dignity too.

154
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,512
What respect? They will
chase me now. - Mind your tongue.

155
00:23:40,582 --> 00:23:41,674
You are just blabbering away.

156
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,843
You don't stare at me.

157
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:48,513
Silent, it is too much now.
You talk too much.

158
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,852
Hey.

159
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,530
Dog.

160
00:24:04,206 --> 00:24:05,867
But how did the shooter reach there?

161
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:08,541
Are your prisons safe?

162
00:24:09,611 --> 00:24:10,873
See, we are holding an enquiry.

163
00:24:11,046 --> 00:24:12,877
Please be quiet.

164
00:24:12,948 --> 00:24:14,540
One person at a time.

165
00:24:14,616 --> 00:24:16,709
See, this isn't done.

166
00:24:19,621 --> 00:24:21,054
Tell me.

167
00:24:24,226 --> 00:24:25,887
When?

168
00:24:29,064 --> 00:24:30,554
We have come to
know about Vishnubhai.

169
00:24:33,635 --> 00:24:35,569
He is hiding at Vishram Bhagat's.

170
00:24:46,748 --> 00:24:48,579
Shankar.

171
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,584
Dad is calling you.

172
00:25:18,947 --> 00:25:23,611
Silver Mani. Rasheed.

173
00:25:25,354 --> 00:25:26,787
Vishram Bhagat.

174
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:36,623
And we got the news right now.

175
00:25:39,701 --> 00:25:41,635
Brother is with him.

176
00:25:41,703 --> 00:25:42,795
Brother.

177
00:26:15,337 --> 00:26:17,669
What mistake did we commit?

178
00:26:24,346 --> 00:26:26,678
We taught the whole world.

179
00:26:29,351 --> 00:26:33,014
We couldn't teach
anything to our son.

180
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:56,700
They will use him and then leave him.

181
00:27:00,048 --> 00:27:02,710
They will throw him out..

182
00:27:03,785 --> 00:27:05,719
..when their work is done.

183
00:27:22,237 --> 00:27:23,727
Juice.

184
00:27:23,805 --> 00:27:25,238
No.

185
00:27:54,836 --> 00:27:56,098
Mr. Vishram.

186
00:27:56,171 --> 00:27:57,934
Sarkar has got bail.

187
00:28:00,108 --> 00:28:04,772
And secondly, he knows
that you have done all this.

188
00:28:13,455 --> 00:28:15,787
The police have
confirmed that the person..

189
00:28:15,857 --> 00:28:20,385
..who attacked Subhash Nagre,
wasn't Khurana's man.

190
00:28:20,462 --> 00:28:22,794
This also has raised questions..

191
00:28:22,864 --> 00:28:24,798
..whether a third
part is responsible..

192
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:27,130
..for Khurana's death.

193
00:28:27,202 --> 00:28:29,397
The public is
wondering whether this is a..

194
00:28:29,471 --> 00:28:32,804
..political
conspiracy to take advantage..

195
00:28:32,874 --> 00:28:36,810
..of the Nagre
Khurana personal enmity.

196
00:29:08,443 --> 00:29:10,172
Hey..

197
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,850
Come.

198
00:29:41,943 --> 00:29:43,376
Thanks.

199
00:29:44,546 --> 00:29:45,877
For what?

200
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:49,880
The way you looked after dad.

201
00:29:56,158 --> 00:29:58,888
I know that..

202
00:29:59,227 --> 00:30:05,223
..you didn't think
about me in that way.

203
00:30:19,414 --> 00:30:20,904
And.. I..

204
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,252
I want to know..

205
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,259
Whether you..

206
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,274
Whether you..

207
00:31:55,076 --> 00:31:57,010
Very good, Shankar.

208
00:31:57,178 --> 00:31:59,009
This is great.

209
00:31:59,347 --> 00:32:02,009
I have sacked that commissioner.

210
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:04,017
Subhash.

211
00:32:04,085 --> 00:32:07,350
If possible, please forgive me.

212
00:32:08,356 --> 00:32:12,019
Even I was fooled like everyone.

213
00:32:13,528 --> 00:32:15,689
Thank you, sister-in-law, thank you.

214
00:32:20,535 --> 00:32:22,025
What do you think?

215
00:32:22,771 --> 00:32:25,035
Who all are behind this?

216
00:32:26,107 --> 00:32:28,041
All of us are gone now.

217
00:32:28,643 --> 00:32:31,043
Sarkar has found out about us.

218
00:32:33,114 --> 00:32:35,048
We will die one by one now.

219
00:32:36,551 --> 00:32:38,712
He will not spare any of us.

220
00:32:39,721 --> 00:32:41,382
I know him.

221
00:32:44,225 --> 00:32:46,056
I am going to Tamil Nadu.

222
00:32:47,395 --> 00:32:50,057
Whatever villages are
left after the Tsunami..

223
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:55,563
I will settle in any one of them.

224
00:32:57,138 --> 00:32:59,663
You go to Dubai.

225
00:32:59,741 --> 00:33:02,073
No, Sarkar has got
contacts till there.

226
00:33:02,143 --> 00:33:05,408
I have an idea. You have sand there..

227
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,079
Dig there and hide.

228
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:09,411
You are gone.

229
00:33:09,484 --> 00:33:15,753
Vishram. Even if you die, Sarkar will
give you life again, just to kill you

230
00:33:18,593 --> 00:33:20,083
Swami-ji.

231
00:33:20,261 --> 00:33:22,092
You are safe.

232
00:33:22,163 --> 00:33:24,597
Sing 'Hare Rama Hare Krishna'. .

233
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:28,830
..and a couple of devotional
songs on full volume.

234
00:33:29,437 --> 00:33:31,428
There will be a meeting very soon.

235
00:33:32,774 --> 00:33:35,174
The greatest mistake.

236
00:33:35,243 --> 00:33:37,108
In my life.

237
00:33:37,178 --> 00:33:38,440
I listened to you.

238
00:33:38,613 --> 00:33:40,103
Why are you talking so much?

239
00:33:41,616 --> 00:33:44,107
We will go to his house and kill him.

240
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,110
You will go to
Sarkar's house and kill him?

241
00:33:48,189 --> 00:33:50,123
His house isn't a house,
it is a fort.

242
00:33:51,192 --> 00:33:52,625
There is a whole army inside.

243
00:33:52,694 --> 00:33:57,131
And there is security outside.
There is no way out.

244
00:33:57,198 --> 00:33:59,132
There is no other way out.

245
00:34:00,468 --> 00:34:02,129
There is.

246
00:34:02,737 --> 00:34:04,136
Son. Don't commit the mistake..

247
00:34:04,205 --> 00:34:09,472
..of getting trapped by
the desires of the body.

248
00:34:11,312 --> 00:34:15,476
The body is just a case for the soul.

249
00:34:16,751 --> 00:34:18,480
Understand this.

250
00:34:19,888 --> 00:34:23,153
You are not killing your father.

251
00:34:23,758 --> 00:34:27,159
You are killing his body.

252
00:34:28,229 --> 00:34:31,164
Yes.
- As it is, Vishnu.

253
00:34:31,232 --> 00:34:34,167
How long will your
father stay alive now?

254
00:34:34,235 --> 00:34:36,499
Ten years? Fifteen years.

255
00:34:36,671 --> 00:34:38,764
This will happen then.

256
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,173
Till the time
Subhash Nagre is alive..

257
00:34:43,511 --> 00:34:48,778
Vishnu Nagre will be
a pauper till then.

258
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:53,184
Really. He hasn't let him
be his own man all his life.

259
00:34:53,254 --> 00:34:54,346
See, Vishnu.

260
00:34:54,422 --> 00:34:57,516
You know that we have done
more than your father for you.

261
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,191
If we weren't there yesterday..

262
00:35:00,528 --> 00:35:03,190
You would be in prison by now.

263
00:35:03,264 --> 00:35:05,528
You know that, isn't it?

264
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,867
Arjun had killed his relatives too.

265
00:35:11,272 --> 00:35:17,211
Hey, Vishnu. There isn't
anything right or wrong.

266
00:35:17,378 --> 00:35:19,369
Sarkar says it, doesn't he?

267
00:35:19,447 --> 00:35:21,540
The one who has power..

268
00:35:21,616 --> 00:35:23,208
Even their wrong..

269
00:35:23,284 --> 00:35:24,546
Is right.

270
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:08,261
I have to meet Shankar.

271
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:15,267
They were planning to kill dad.

272
00:36:18,873 --> 00:36:20,602
They told me to do that.

273
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:28,610
I am dad's bad son, isn't it?

274
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:39,292
But I am his son.

275
00:36:43,965 --> 00:36:45,956
I am sorry, mother.

276
00:36:57,378 --> 00:36:59,312
Mother.

277
00:37:07,822 --> 00:37:09,653
Hey, Shankar.

278
00:37:34,415 --> 00:37:36,349
Dad.

279
00:37:37,418 --> 00:37:40,353
He wants to ask forgiveness from you.

280
00:37:43,424 --> 00:37:45,688
He is repenting on his antics.

281
00:37:50,031 --> 00:37:52,363
Everyone commits a mistake.

282
00:37:58,006 --> 00:38:00,372
He will never do anything like this.

283
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:04,376
He has learnt his lesson.

284
00:38:11,452 --> 00:38:13,386
Why didn't he come?

285
00:38:13,454 --> 00:38:16,389
He cannot face you.

286
00:38:20,461 --> 00:38:22,395
Tell me.

287
00:38:23,464 --> 00:38:25,398
Shall I let him come in the house?

288
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,559
What is it?

289
00:41:07,628 --> 00:41:08,959
What is it?

290
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:13,564
Shankar.. Vishnu.. Vishnu..

291
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,569
What were you doing?

292
00:41:17,905 --> 00:41:19,566
What were you two doing?

293
00:41:20,741 --> 00:41:23,904
Shankar.. stop..

294
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,991
Shankar..

295
00:41:41,095 --> 00:41:42,756
What did he do?

296
00:42:20,801 --> 00:42:27,639
Hello. - Vishnu. - Yes, Vishnu,
tell me. - Sarkar is finished.

297
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:32,645
I have looked after Shankar too.

298
00:42:34,815 --> 00:42:36,646
He is going back to America.

299
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,653
We rule.

300
00:42:43,724 --> 00:42:46,659
There is good news for you.

301
00:42:46,727 --> 00:42:47,785
What?

302
00:42:47,862 --> 00:42:50,660
Sarkar is finished.
- What?

303
00:42:51,265 --> 00:42:54,996
Sarkar is finished.

304
00:42:56,737 --> 00:42:59,069
Sarkar is finished.

305
00:46:37,787 --> 00:46:39,448
I killed brother.

306
00:47:56,699 --> 00:47:58,030
What now?

307
00:48:38,641 --> 00:48:40,575
Greetings.
- Greetings.

308
00:48:45,648 --> 00:48:47,582
Durga..

309
00:48:54,924 --> 00:49:05,926
Govinda.

310
00:49:35,131 --> 00:49:43,630
Govinda.

311
00:51:09,792 --> 00:51:14,058
Govinda.

312
00:51:19,402 --> 00:51:22,064
It wasn't necessary for
me to be here to kill you.

313
00:51:28,077 --> 00:51:31,410
But I wanted to experience the
enjoyment of seeing you die.

314
00:52:51,427 --> 00:52:56,831
How can we live
with this injustice?

315
00:52:57,433 --> 00:53:02,427
We will go to the
doors of the master.

316
00:53:02,505 --> 00:53:09,843
Injustice..

317
00:53:10,179 --> 00:53:16,846
How can we tolerate it?

318
00:53:16,919 --> 00:53:23,188
The master doesn't forget..

319
00:53:23,459 --> 00:53:27,862
He doesn't commit mistakes..

320
00:53:49,552 --> 00:53:52,885
Son. It is written
in the Bhagwad Gita.

321
00:53:52,955 --> 00:53:54,889
I am an atheist.

322
00:54:08,971 --> 00:54:11,906
You have just one choice now.

323
00:54:17,246 --> 00:54:19,908
Either meet your God.

324
00:54:24,987 --> 00:54:26,420
Or me.

325
00:55:08,564 --> 00:55:11,965
Come, Shankar. Come.

326
00:55:14,036 --> 00:55:15,970
Have a seat.

327
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:19,974
What was the urgency?

328
00:55:25,314 --> 00:55:26,975
Rasheed is dead.

329
00:55:31,053 --> 00:55:33,988
Silver Mani and Vishram too.

330
00:55:36,592 --> 00:55:39,993
Why are you telling me all this?

331
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:50,670
Because when someone dies,
their closest people are told.

332
00:55:52,074 --> 00:55:53,166
What do you mean?

333
00:55:56,078 --> 00:55:57,136
I mean..

334
00:55:57,213 --> 00:55:59,010
I always knew that you
were hand in glove with them.

335
00:56:14,096 --> 00:56:16,030
They were the bullets.

336
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,034
You were the gun.

337
00:56:32,648 --> 00:56:34,377
When Sarkar was there..

338
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:39,051
Even though you were
the Chief Minister..

339
00:56:39,121 --> 00:56:42,056
..you weren't anything but a doll.

340
00:56:44,126 --> 00:56:46,060
Your power would increase..

341
00:56:46,228 --> 00:56:49,061
..when Sarkar's power would decrease.

342
00:56:51,734 --> 00:56:56,068
And you used Rasheed
and Vishram Bhagat.

343
00:56:59,809 --> 00:57:04,075
The man with whom you
wanted to kill Sarkar's thought.

344
00:57:05,147 --> 00:57:08,082
With the help of the same man,
I killed your thought.

345
00:57:11,754 --> 00:57:14,086
Your underworld connections.

346
00:57:14,757 --> 00:57:16,418
Black money.

347
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:19,093
Your foreign bank accounts.

348
00:57:19,695 --> 00:57:23,096
Narinder Swami has
told it to the CBI team.

349
00:57:25,167 --> 00:57:28,102
They will be
reaching here at any time.

350
00:57:29,171 --> 00:57:33,107
Son, I run the government.

351
00:57:34,443 --> 00:57:36,604
I am the chief minister.

352
00:57:36,712 --> 00:57:39,112
Whether Swami testifies,
or anyone else..

353
00:57:39,181 --> 00:57:42,116
I will be out of the
enquiry in two days.

354
00:57:45,187 --> 00:57:46,620
That is what I want too.

355
00:57:46,722 --> 00:57:50,123
Govinda.

356
00:58:23,325 --> 00:58:28,490
Govinda.

357
00:58:35,337 --> 00:58:37,168
Govinda.

358
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:39,571
After the prime minister
asked the chief minister..

359
00:58:39,642 --> 00:58:41,507
..Madan Rathod to resign..

360
00:58:41,677 --> 00:58:44,168
..the mid term polls have
been announced in the state.

361
00:58:44,346 --> 00:58:47,509
The aspirant for the
chief minister's post is..

362
00:58:47,783 --> 00:58:49,842
Haridas Shinde, and everyone
knows that he will..

363
00:58:49,919 --> 00:58:51,784
..win the election this time.

364
00:58:51,854 --> 00:58:55,187
Because he is
supported by Subhash Nagre.

365
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:27,211
The police came to our
house and took my husband away.

366
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:33,557
They hit him so much,
they killed him.

367
00:59:36,298 --> 00:59:37,356
Then..

368
00:59:37,433 --> 00:59:38,730
They threw his dead
body on the road..

369
00:59:38,801 --> 00:59:40,234
..and prepared a fake report..

370
00:59:40,302 --> 00:59:41,394
That he was a gangster.

371
00:59:42,738 --> 00:59:44,899
He attacked the police.

372
00:59:46,308 --> 00:59:48,242
I want to have them punished.

373
00:59:48,744 --> 00:59:50,905
I want to avenge my husband.

374
00:59:52,581 --> 00:59:57,917
Please give justice for my husband.

375
00:59:58,754 --> 01:00:01,655
Please give my husband justice.

376
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:03,749
Sarkar.
