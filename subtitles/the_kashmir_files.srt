1
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:31,757
Come on, what can Sachin do?
He's not a good player.

2
00:02:31,834 --> 00:02:35,904
He can't play a single good shot.

3
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:56,986
- Hey, Shiva!
- Hey, Abdul!

4
00:03:06,355 --> 00:03:08,198
Sachin, Sachin!

5
00:03:08,506 --> 00:03:10,848
Sachin, Sachin!

6
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:13,958
- Sachin, Sachin!
- Stop screaming Sachin's name.

7
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:15,878
- But why Abdul?
- Look over there.

8
00:03:15,955 --> 00:03:17,338
The big guys are watching.
They will have a problem.

9
00:03:17,453 --> 00:03:20,909
I'll chop that Sachin's legs
off and hand them over to him.

10
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,627
You bloody Sachin Tendulkar fan!

11
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:30,816
Indian Dog! He'll hit a six against us?

12
00:03:30,854 --> 00:03:32,390
Let's teach him a lesson.

13
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:36,384
You bastard. You Indian dog.

14
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:38,957
Say Long Live Pakistan,
Death to Hindustan!

15
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:39,878
Come on, say it.

16
00:03:39,955 --> 00:03:41,875
Say it!
Say it!

17
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,872
- Say Long Live Pakistan!
- Abdul!

18
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:46,406
- Abdul!
- Say Long Live Pakistan!

19
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:47,405
Come on, say it!

20
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,365
- Say it.
- Abdul!

21
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:49,517
Say it, you bastard!

22
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:52,589
- Abdul! Abdul!
- Let him go!

23
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,894
Come on, say it.

24
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:59,117
Run, Shiva! Come on, run!

25
00:03:59,654 --> 00:04:03,955
Stop! Where are you running?
You bloody dog.

26
00:04:29,414 --> 00:04:30,566
You know how bad the
Situation.

27
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:32,486
Why did you step outside your house?

28
00:04:32,717 --> 00:04:34,445
She has a very high fever.

29
00:05:01,747 --> 00:05:06,086
Go tell your husband to run away
from Kashmir and leave you here.

30
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,115
And this Hindu girl...
I'll marry her to my younger brother.

31
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:16,378
Don't touch her!

32
00:05:22,944 --> 00:05:25,862
Convert! Run! Or Die!

33
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:28,704
Convert! Run! Or Die!

34
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:30,854
Convert! Run! Or Die!

35
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,811
Muslims wake up, infidels run away!

36
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:36,077
Muslims wake up, infidels run away!

37
00:05:39,994 --> 00:05:43,488
If you want to live in Kashmir,
you will have to say Allah is the greatest!

38
00:05:43,565 --> 00:05:46,790
If you want to live in Kashmir,
you will have to say Allah is the greatest!

39
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:48,864
Allah is the greatest!

40
00:05:49,018 --> 00:05:50,669
Allah is the greatest!

41
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:55,968
Run, Shiva!

42
00:05:57,005 --> 00:06:02,035
I rock your cradle which swings
like my long earring.

43
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:06,912
I rock your cradle which swings
like my long earrings.

44
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:11,328
Krishna... Krishna.

45
00:06:12,326 --> 00:06:17,702
I shall give my life for you.
O' my dear,

46
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:20,390
Your cradle swings
like my long earrings.

47
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:28,032
I shall give my life for you.
O' my dear,

48
00:06:28,147 --> 00:06:32,525
Your cradle swings
like my long earrings.

49
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:47,117
Why hasn't Father come back yet?
Shiva was supposed to come back with him.

50
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:49,114
They must be stuck
because of the procession.

51
00:06:51,072 --> 00:06:53,376
God knows when their
processions will end.

52
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,525
Find out if Abdul is back.

53
00:06:56,678 --> 00:06:57,792
He had left with Shiva.

54
00:07:02,246 --> 00:07:03,398
Brother.

55
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:04,781
Yes?

56
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,125
Is Abdul back?

57
00:07:06,278 --> 00:07:08,045
He had gone to play cricket with Shiva.

58
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:11,040
I thought they are supposed
to return with your father.

59
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:13,075
I have called him.

60
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:16,685
What's going on, Brother?

61
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:20,218
I think the situation
is going to get worse.

62
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:23,405
You should leave for a few days.

63
00:07:23,827 --> 00:07:25,171
Leave?

64
00:07:25,248 --> 00:07:26,592
How can we just leave our home and go?

65
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:28,512
Don't worry about it.

66
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:30,739
I'll take care of your house.

67
00:07:30,931 --> 00:07:32,966
When you come back...

68
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:38,726
This won't last for long.
Just a couple of days at the most.

69
00:07:39,456 --> 00:07:40,224
Let me know when Abdul comes back.

70
00:07:40,608 --> 00:07:41,530
Run, Shiva!

71
00:07:41,645 --> 00:07:45,485
The great slogan is Allah is the greatest!

72
00:07:45,638 --> 00:07:47,904
The great slogan is Allah is the greatest!

73
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,245
Kashmir will become Pakistan!

74
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,280
Kashmir will become Pakistan!

75
00:07:53,357 --> 00:07:54,931
Kashmir will become Pakistan!

76
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,390
Kashmir will become Pakistan!

77
00:07:56,506 --> 00:07:58,157
Kashmir will become Pakistan!

78
00:07:58,234 --> 00:07:59,770
Kashmir will become Pakistan!

79
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:01,229
Kashmir will become Pakistan!

80
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:07,373
Om!

81
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:12,134
Om!

82
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:18,816
Master, I think we'll
have to stop the rehearsal.

83
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:20,390
The situation is quite tense.

84
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:22,387
Maha Shivratri takes place in March.

85
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,845
I have seen many such
processions come and go.

86
00:08:24,998 --> 00:08:28,301
Nobody will disturb us.
They have that much sense!

87
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:31,181
Om!

88
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:32,064
Hello?

89
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:33,331
Who?

90
00:08:33,485 --> 00:08:34,790
Mr. Pushkar Nath?

91
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:37,325
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

92
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,091
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

93
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:40,474
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

94
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,125
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

95
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,584
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

96
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:45,504
Allah is the greatest!

97
00:08:45,581 --> 00:08:47,270
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

98
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:50,765
This country is ours!

99
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:53,299
If this is our country,

100
00:08:53,376 --> 00:08:56,870
Then tell me, who will rule over it?

101
00:08:56,947 --> 00:09:00,134
We will! We will! We will!

102
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:03,514
Who will fight in its war for freedom?

103
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:06,470
We will! We will! We will!

104
00:09:06,586 --> 00:09:08,698
If we want to fight the war for freedom,

105
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:14,112
our people should
know who our enemy is!

106
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:16,800
India! India! India!

107
00:09:16,877 --> 00:09:18,605
Who has enslaved us?

108
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,485
India! India! India!

109
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,632
There is only one way
to teach India a lesson.

110
00:09:26,054 --> 00:09:29,165
There is only one solution
to the Kashmir problem.

111
00:09:29,664 --> 00:09:31,584
Holy Jihad!

112
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,965
Holy Jihad!

113
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,685
Shiva!

114
00:09:40,838 --> 00:09:42,298
- Grandpa!
- Shiva!

115
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:43,987
Grandpa!

116
00:09:44,678 --> 00:09:46,790
Where were you?
I was so scared.

117
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:49,325
The sacrifice of martyrs
won't go in vain!

118
00:09:49,478 --> 00:09:51,667
The sacrifice of martyrs
won't go in vain!

119
00:09:51,744 --> 00:09:54,240
We will unfurl the flag
of our religious reign!

120
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:56,429
We will unfurl
the flag of our religious reign.

121
00:09:56,506 --> 00:09:58,886
Wake up! Wake up! It is already dawn:

122
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:00,960
Wake up! Wake up! It is already dawn:

123
00:10:01,037 --> 00:10:03,686
Russia has already been defeated!

124
00:10:03,725 --> 00:10:05,645
Russia has already been defeated!

125
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,141
India is under attack!

126
00:10:08,218 --> 00:10:10,368
India is under attack!

127
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:13,901
Now Kashmir will rise!

128
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:15,744
Now Kashmir will rise!

129
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:18,317
Now freedom will soon be ours!

130
00:10:18,394 --> 00:10:21,389
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

131
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:24,461
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

132
00:10:24,538 --> 00:10:27,341
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

133
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:31,181
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

134
00:10:33,485 --> 00:10:35,597
Where are you going? Habba Kadal?

135
00:10:35,712 --> 00:10:36,672
Follow us.

136
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:40,550
Hail Lord Shiva.
Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva.

137
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:28,051
They're here. Terrorists.

138
00:11:31,085 --> 00:11:33,581
- I'll go see.
- No, no, no.

139
00:11:33,965 --> 00:11:37,037
You won't.
You go hide in the rice-drum.

140
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,418
You want me to hide like a coward?

141
00:11:39,955 --> 00:11:41,338
Listen!

142
00:11:43,373 --> 00:11:45,101
Like a clever man.

143
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:49,306
No! He's not upstairs!

144
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:50,995
I am telling you the truth!

145
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:52,800
He's gone to Jammu!
I am telling you the truth!

146
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:54,605
I swear, I told you the truth!

147
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:58,368
He has gone to Jammu!
He is not there! I told you the truth!

148
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,288
He is not there! I told you the truth!

149
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:03,245
He is not there! I told you the truth!

150
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:05,165
Let go! You Hindu woman!

151
00:13:07,814 --> 00:13:10,272
Have mercy on us please.

152
00:13:10,426 --> 00:13:13,690
Please spare us.

153
00:13:14,304 --> 00:13:16,570
Please show us mercy.

154
00:13:16,685 --> 00:13:18,758
Have mercy on us please.

155
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:33,619
Have mercy on us please.

156
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:35,885
Have mercy on us please.

157
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,688
Have mercy on us please.

158
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,798
Have mercy on us please.

159
00:13:42,336 --> 00:13:46,368
Have mercy on us please.

160
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:49,325
Oh mother!

161
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,013
Have mercy...
don't kill us please!

162
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,928
Bloody Indian spy.

163
00:13:57,926 --> 00:13:59,270
Indian Dog!

164
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:05,952
Forgive us, mercy...
don't kill us please!

165
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:07,027
Freedom!

166
00:14:07,104 --> 00:14:08,448
Forgive us, mercy...

167
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,176
Freedom!

168
00:14:10,253 --> 00:14:11,558
Freedom!

169
00:14:11,674 --> 00:14:12,595
Freedom!

170
00:14:12,749 --> 00:14:13,786
Freedom!

171
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:14,861
Freedom!

172
00:14:28,378 --> 00:14:33,485
Oh mother!

173
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:39,437
I am devastated.

174
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:49,613
Oh mother, I am devastated!

175
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,954
Father... I am devastated!

176
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:55,910
What have you done?

177
00:14:58,061 --> 00:15:02,170
Let her go, kill me instead!

178
00:15:02,285 --> 00:15:03,437
Father!

179
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:06,125
Let my daughter-in-law go,
kill me instead!

180
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,006
We won't kill you, Pandit.

181
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,926
Someone needs to be left
behind to cry..

182
00:15:09,965 --> 00:15:10,925
No!

183
00:15:11,232 --> 00:15:13,690
Hail Lord Shiva!

184
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:15,341
Bastard!

185
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:20,486
If you want to stay in Kashmir,
you have to say Allah is the Greatest.

186
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:21,677
Father!

187
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:23,789
I bear witness that
there is no deity but Allah,

188
00:15:23,866 --> 00:15:26,285
and I bear witness that Muhammad
is the messenger of Allah.

189
00:15:27,782 --> 00:15:31,853
Aren't you Farooq Malik Bitta,
my student?

190
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:36,230
I was your teacher. I've taught you,
what the hell are you doing to me?

191
00:15:36,538 --> 00:15:37,574
Hey Pandit.

192
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,648
Bitta is no longer your student.

193
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:41,914
Call me Area
Commander Farooq Janab!

194
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,795
Farooq Janab.

195
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:46,598
Address him as Area
Commander Farooq Janab, you Hindu!

196
00:15:46,944 --> 00:15:48,365
Father!

197
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,824
Father!

198
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:52,128
Please leave father, kill me instead.

199
00:15:52,205 --> 00:15:53,318
Let him go.

200
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:54,854
Please.

201
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,310
Please leave father, kill me instead.

202
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:01,690
But what is our fault?

203
00:16:01,805 --> 00:16:06,029
Why are you doing this to us?

204
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:09,715
What's wrong with you guys?

205
00:16:14,477 --> 00:16:15,898
Fine.

206
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:17,971
I'll spare all your lives.

207
00:16:44,774 --> 00:16:46,656
If you eat this rice.

208
00:16:51,456 --> 00:16:58,214
(Baby Krishna crying)

209
00:18:03,878 --> 00:18:05,184
Take this.

210
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:15,590
Hello.

211
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:18,931
Yes, wait there.

212
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:20,045
He will come.

213
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:22,464
What's wrong?
The flight didn't land?

214
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:23,885
It has landed.

215
00:18:24,154 --> 00:18:25,958
So, he wasn't on it?

216
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:27,648
He will come.

217
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,451
His baggage must have been delayed.

218
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:33,638
Are you sure he boarded from Delhi?

219
00:18:33,754 --> 00:18:35,213
Yes, he did.

220
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:37,517
He had messaged me.

221
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,320
Why haven't the others come?

222
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,355
They should have reached by now.

223
00:18:42,624 --> 00:18:44,774
How long does it take from Jammu?

224
00:18:45,312 --> 00:18:46,925
They will come as well.

225
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:49,306
They are coming by road.

226
00:18:49,805 --> 00:18:51,955
It can get late sometimes.

227
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:12,941
Everything will be fine.

228
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:17,280
You should get ready.

229
00:20:27,341 --> 00:20:29,645
Hari Narain. Hello.

230
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:30,835
Hello.

231
00:20:31,258 --> 00:20:32,256
How are you?

232
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:33,677
Good.

233
00:20:34,445 --> 00:20:36,557
- Hello, Laxmi!
- Hello, Vishnu.

234
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:39,514
You still look the same.

235
00:20:39,744 --> 00:20:42,317
People who work for the
media do not change on the outside.

236
00:20:42,624 --> 00:20:43,853
Hmm.

237
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,965
And where do policemen change from?

238
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,115
I think the doctor will know.

239
00:20:48,653 --> 00:20:49,997
Hello, Laxmi.

240
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:51,571
Hello. Dr. Mahesh.

241
00:20:51,648 --> 00:20:52,915
You look fine.

242
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:54,413
Thank you.

243
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,178
Has he come?

244
00:20:57,446 --> 00:20:58,944
His flight has landed.

245
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,749
Our driver's waiting at the airport.

246
00:21:01,939 --> 00:21:03,437
Where's Brahma?

247
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:17,914
Listen guys, let's make a rule.

248
00:21:18,758 --> 00:21:22,099
We won't talk about
our past in front of him.

249
00:21:23,405 --> 00:21:25,248
No politics either.

250
00:21:25,478 --> 00:21:27,475
And no Kashmir.

251
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:31,085
I understand politics...
but why no Kashmir?

252
00:21:33,235 --> 00:21:35,347
What's the difference?

253
00:21:37,344 --> 00:21:40,685
So, no mention of exodus?

254
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,374
No.

255
00:21:43,373 --> 00:21:45,254
Not exodus...

256
00:21:49,286 --> 00:21:51,245
Genocide.

257
00:21:53,357 --> 00:21:55,315
Look who's here.

258
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,730
Look who's here.

259
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,648
Krishna.

260
00:22:15,053 --> 00:22:16,205
Please sit down.

261
00:22:16,704 --> 00:22:17,741
Why are you guys standing?

262
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,046
Not for you.

263
00:22:21,888 --> 00:22:22,886
For Pushkar.

264
00:22:33,331 --> 00:22:35,635
We will have to leave early tomorrow.

265
00:22:35,827 --> 00:22:40,320
There's curfew in Habba Kadal
after 7 o'clock.

266
00:22:40,435 --> 00:22:41,011
Okay.

267
00:22:41,088 --> 00:22:43,085
We'll leave for Jammu from there itself.

268
00:22:43,392 --> 00:22:44,237
Hmm.

269
00:22:44,314 --> 00:22:45,773
Thank you.

270
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:48,768
You plan to stay here
for a couple of days, right?

271
00:22:49,075 --> 00:22:50,304
No.

272
00:22:50,381 --> 00:22:53,338
Actually, I have to meet
a couple of people tomorrow.

273
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,027
And I'm going back day after tomorrow.

274
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:56,448
So soon?

275
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:59,059
I have some important work in Delhi,
day after tomorrow.

276
00:22:59,405 --> 00:23:02,976
You could have stayed and seen Kashmir.

277
00:23:03,898 --> 00:23:05,818
Maybe next time.

278
00:23:07,046 --> 00:23:11,040
But I'd like to visit the place
of my parents' accident.

279
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,989
Why? What happened?

280
00:23:26,054 --> 00:23:28,205
This is your first time in Kashmir?

281
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:31,661
He was born here.

282
00:23:31,738 --> 00:23:32,966
I know.

283
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,578
How will he remember anything?

284
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,574
He was just a baby back then.

285
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:43,066
I remember most of my childhood.

286
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,909
Honestly, I don't remember anything.

287
00:23:46,445 --> 00:23:50,131
I am sure Pushkar must
have told you something.

288
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:51,782
I mean what all happened and--

289
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:53,626
We decided no politics.

290
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:57,965
This isn't politics.

291
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,230
I just want to know

292
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,650
what you know about Kashmir.
That's all.

293
00:24:08,064 --> 00:24:10,675
Kashmir has never been
an integral part of India

294
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,210
and this is a historical fact.

295
00:24:14,054 --> 00:24:17,894
In fact, there was condition laid
down for Kashmir's accession with India,

296
00:24:18,739 --> 00:24:22,579
That a plebiscite was supposed take
place as soon as the situation normalizes.

297
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:24,768
It means a people's vote.

298
00:24:25,766 --> 00:24:26,918
Did the plebiscite ever take place?

299
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:28,454
- No!
- Never!

300
00:24:28,531 --> 00:24:30,950
- Free Kashmir!
- Free Kashmir!

301
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:33,293
- Free Kashmir!
- Free Kashmir!

302
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:38,170
If political parties have
a right to have their own flags,

303
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,205
then why don't Kashmiris?

304
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:44,659
If India can fight with
Britain for its independence

305
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,579
then why can't Kashmir?

306
00:24:47,846 --> 00:24:51,994
If Bhagat Singh is celebrated
then why isn't Burhan Wani?

307
00:24:52,109 --> 00:24:55,296
Long live, Burhan Wani!

308
00:24:55,373 --> 00:24:58,675
Long live, Burhan Wani!

309
00:24:59,405 --> 00:25:03,821
Today the world believes that we
have illegally occupied Kashmir.

310
00:25:04,397 --> 00:25:07,085
If you pick any leading international
newspapers like Newsweek, New York Times,

311
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:08,813
Washington Post...

312
00:25:08,928 --> 00:25:13,114
or pick any important document
of any powerful country for that matter.

313
00:25:13,229 --> 00:25:18,451
Kashmir isn't included
in their map of India

314
00:25:18,528 --> 00:25:21,408
Because the world believes
that Kashmir is not a part of India.

315
00:25:22,637 --> 00:25:27,130
The Indian army makes an entire village
stand outside on a cold winter night,

316
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:29,510
in the name of cordon-and-search.

317
00:25:29,587 --> 00:25:31,930
Children, old people, pregnant women,
no one is spared.

318
00:25:32,237 --> 00:25:33,811
Shame!

319
00:25:33,888 --> 00:25:39,034
Terrorists like Abu Salem and
Kasab get special treatment for years

320
00:25:39,648 --> 00:25:42,605
And Afzal Guru wasn't
even allowed to meet his family.

321
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:44,371
Afzal, we apologise!

322
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,061
For your killers are still alive!

323
00:25:46,138 --> 00:25:47,558
Afzal, we apologise!

324
00:25:47,674 --> 00:25:49,325
For your killers are still alive!

325
00:25:49,517 --> 00:25:53,165
Kids of Kashmir grow up without fathers.

326
00:25:53,626 --> 00:25:57,773
They still survive with the hope
that their father will return one day.

327
00:25:58,733 --> 00:26:03,341
And when this kid raises a
question they call him a terrorist!

328
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:08,870
Now if this kid won't throw stones,
will he shower you with flowers?

329
00:26:10,675 --> 00:26:13,094
And when you start talking
against this fascism,

330
00:26:13,325 --> 00:26:18,432
The so-called "Nationalists"
will troll you on social media.

331
00:26:18,854 --> 00:26:20,851
They will call you a traitor.

332
00:26:20,966 --> 00:26:23,654
They will say things like,
"go to Pakistan".

333
00:26:24,653 --> 00:26:27,456
But don't worry,
I'm not going to Pakistan.

334
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,797
In fact, I'm not going anywhere.

335
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,755
Exactly like this country.

336
00:26:38,246 --> 00:26:42,048
Our team has researched
at these five places:

337
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:46,080
Kupwara, Baramula,
Bandipora, Poonch and Rajouri.

338
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,416
And we found even more than
7000 mass graves here.

339
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,451
Professor Menon?

340
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:56,525
You can call me Radhika.

341
00:26:58,445 --> 00:26:59,712
What about Batta Mazar?

342
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,245
What is Batta Mazar?

343
00:27:03,437 --> 00:27:06,202
The place where 100,000 Kashmiri
Hindus were drowned in Dal Lake.

344
00:27:06,778 --> 00:27:09,965
There were seven piles of the just the
sacred thread gathered from the dead.

345
00:27:10,618 --> 00:27:12,806
The place where they were
cremated is known as Batta Mazar.

346
00:27:12,845 --> 00:27:15,456
Sit down, man.

347
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,800
- You know...
- Saying the truth--

348
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:18,950
You'll make a
very good politician someday,

349
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:20,794
Oh, thank you ma'am.

350
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:24,634
No one knows who these
7000 graves belong to.

351
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:31,354
But we know that if today's students
don't raise their voice for Kashmir

352
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:38,035
Then one day Kashmir too
will become a big unmarked grave.

353
00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:44,294
We will get Kashmir out of this darkness.

354
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,675
We will get our Freedom from them!

355
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,710
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

356
00:27:48,826 --> 00:27:50,630
- In one voice!
- Freedom!

357
00:27:50,746 --> 00:27:52,704
- Louder!
- Freedom!

358
00:27:52,781 --> 00:27:54,470
- We want Freedom from federalism!
- Freedom!

359
00:27:54,586 --> 00:27:56,890
- We want Freedom from Hindu ideologies!
- Freedom!

360
00:27:57,005 --> 00:27:58,733
- We will get our Freedom from them!
- Freedom!

361
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,499
- It is our right!
- Freedom!

362
00:28:00,614 --> 00:28:02,304
- We'll snatch it away!
- Freedom!

363
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:03,917
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

364
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:06,989
- India, you will break into pieces!
- Inshallah! Inshallah!

365
00:28:07,066 --> 00:28:08,448
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

366
00:28:08,525 --> 00:28:09,830
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

367
00:28:09,907 --> 00:28:11,366
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

368
00:28:11,405 --> 00:28:13,018
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

369
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:14,515
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

370
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,090
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

371
00:28:17,894 --> 00:28:20,006
- Ma'am.
- Oh, it's you again.

372
00:28:20,045 --> 00:28:22,157
Sorry, I didn't mean any disrespect.

373
00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:23,885
You spoke about Kashmir.

374
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,690
But you forgot to mention
that 4,000 Kashmiri Pandits had died there.

375
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:28,646
Not 4,000, 219 was the official figure.

376
00:28:28,685 --> 00:28:31,526
That's because no one reported the truth.

377
00:28:32,218 --> 00:28:33,715
No one?

378
00:28:34,138 --> 00:28:37,555
Administration, historians,
intellectuals, media, professors.

379
00:28:38,285 --> 00:28:41,088
- You mean they are all against you?
- Right.

380
00:28:41,395 --> 00:28:43,469
- Since the past 30 years?
- Absolutely.

381
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:45,658
- Is that true?
- Yes, it is.

382
00:28:48,845 --> 00:28:51,072
Tell me who was the
greatest Kashmiri leader?

383
00:28:51,725 --> 00:28:53,376
Sheikh Abdullah.

384
00:28:57,792 --> 00:28:59,866
It was Lalitaditya.

385
00:29:00,326 --> 00:29:03,437
A Hindu King.
He ruled most of India.

386
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:07,085
We all think that we know the truth.

387
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:09,312
But we don't.

388
00:29:10,848 --> 00:29:15,264
What if what you have believed
to be the truth since

389
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,258
The past 30 years is not true at all?

390
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,600
What's your name?

391
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,405
Krishna Pandit.

392
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:26,093
Ah, Pandit.

393
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:28,090
Now I understand.

394
00:29:28,128 --> 00:29:30,547
Upper caste privilege!
Pandit, huh?

395
00:29:30,893 --> 00:29:32,045
That's not fair, ma'am.

396
00:29:32,467 --> 00:29:34,272
I don't believe in the caste system.

397
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:36,384
I believe in equality and justice.

398
00:29:36,614 --> 00:29:37,920
Really?

399
00:29:38,189 --> 00:29:41,491
Then I want you to scream
"Freedom" out loud.

400
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:45,984
Is the Pandit coming in your way?

401
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,325
Come on, scream.
Come on, don't be inhibited.

402
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:51,821
I said, scream.

403
00:29:55,238 --> 00:29:56,698
Freedom!

404
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,925
There you are.

405
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:04,685
Tomorrow's headline will state
that this was Krishna Pandit's scream.

406
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:11,712
Now think about that child in Kashmir,
his voice doesn't have a name.

407
00:30:12,288 --> 00:30:16,742
He'll always be known
as an Islamic terrorist.

408
00:30:17,165 --> 00:30:20,275
Try listening to the scream of someone

409
00:30:21,312 --> 00:30:23,309
Who doesn't have an identity.

410
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,725
Try being his voice.

411
00:30:28,992 --> 00:30:34,906
And you will know what
Kashmir and its truth is all about.

412
00:30:45,158 --> 00:30:46,694
Freedom.

413
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,189
Freedom.

414
00:30:55,142 --> 00:31:01,286
Sochzal Waangan,
Muj Chetin, Nadru Yakhni, Dum Aloo,

415
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:04,742
and Monj Haakh

416
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:08,429
Oh lovely, I'm getting to enjoy
Kashmiri food after a long time.

417
00:31:08,506 --> 00:31:12,038
I've also cooked Kashmiri food
after a long time.

418
00:31:12,115 --> 00:31:13,651
It looks delicious.

419
00:31:13,728 --> 00:31:15,302
Please help yourselves.

420
00:31:15,955 --> 00:31:17,491
Smells good.

421
00:31:17,606 --> 00:31:21,293
But sorry,
I have never heard of these dishes before.

422
00:31:27,974 --> 00:31:34,502
Your mother Sharda used
to make the best Kashmiri food.

423
00:31:35,846 --> 00:31:37,306
It was a ritual.

424
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:40,262
Every Sunday we used
to have dinner at your place.

425
00:31:41,952 --> 00:31:46,406
You know we perhaps wouldn't
have been such good friends with Pushkar,

426
00:31:46,714 --> 00:31:50,170
if not for your mother's cooking.

427
00:31:50,822 --> 00:31:52,243
Right, Brahma?

428
00:31:54,509 --> 00:31:59,654
That's why no one spoke to him
in the past 30 years.

429
00:32:05,222 --> 00:32:06,912
Please.

430
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:10,944
Here you go.

431
00:32:10,982 --> 00:32:13,018
Looking interesting.

432
00:32:13,555 --> 00:32:15,130
What is this?

433
00:32:15,283 --> 00:32:16,474
Nadru.

434
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,778
How can you not know Nadru being a Kashmiri?

435
00:32:18,931 --> 00:32:22,234
It is believed that the
one who doesn't know about Nadru,

436
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,730
Doesn't truly know about Kashmir.

437
00:32:32,294 --> 00:32:36,864
Home Minister Mufti Mohammad
Sayyed's daughter Rubaiyya Sayeed...

438
00:32:36,902 --> 00:32:39,053
...was kidnapped by JKLF.

439
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,587
Prime Minister has called
for a high-level meeting.

440
00:32:41,664 --> 00:32:47,962
It is believed that the Indian Government
might give in to the terrorist's demands.

441
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:53,184
Ask the Home Minister if Rubaiyya's security
is Central Government's responsibility

442
00:32:53,453 --> 00:32:56,794
Then isn't it also their duty to protect the
people of Kashmir from terrorists and corruption?

443
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,867
Till when will they keep
having such double standards?

444
00:32:58,982 --> 00:33:01,210
What brings you here?

445
00:33:02,592 --> 00:33:06,778
I heard rumours that they've
included my son's name in the hit list.

446
00:33:06,893 --> 00:33:09,466
He has been declared as an Indian spy.

447
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:10,464
I went to the police station.

448
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:12,883
They said they cannot
provide security to everyone.

449
00:33:13,037 --> 00:33:15,610
It seems more than half
of us are on their hit list.

450
00:33:15,802 --> 00:33:17,952
Can you provide the security?

451
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:20,563
Come on, man.

452
00:33:20,717 --> 00:33:21,869
It's my duty.

453
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,789
I'll arrange for your
security at the earliest.

454
00:33:23,942 --> 00:33:25,363
Thank you.

455
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,474
It's good to have IAS officers as friends.

456
00:33:29,664 --> 00:33:32,582
Come, let me drop you home.

457
00:33:36,422 --> 00:33:37,805
Driver, can you please pull over here?

458
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:40,531
- Let me buy some Nadru for Laxmi.
- Hey, come on! Let it be.

459
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,029
Just get down.

460
00:33:51,706 --> 00:33:53,357
How much for Nadru?

461
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:54,662
28 rupees per kilo.

462
00:33:54,893 --> 00:33:56,851
Have you gone crazy?
Lessen the price.

463
00:33:57,158 --> 00:33:58,310
The price is set.

464
00:33:58,387 --> 00:34:00,922
- He won't bring the price down.
- Wait, let me pay.

465
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:04,262
You can pay the day
you start speaking Kashmiri.

466
00:34:04,762 --> 00:34:06,758
Take these.

467
00:34:08,486 --> 00:34:09,946
100 rupees

468
00:34:19,584 --> 00:34:23,616
What are you doing? You're giving me a
Jinnah instead of Gandhi.

469
00:34:24,806 --> 00:34:26,074
He's giving me a Pakistani note.

470
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:29,568
Janab, you'll get the currency
of the country you stay in.

471
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:35,674
What did you say?

472
00:34:36,557 --> 00:34:38,131
Which country?

473
00:34:40,435 --> 00:34:42,394
There is only one country.

474
00:34:43,162 --> 00:34:44,698
India!

475
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:49,267
Don't you feel ashamed betraying your nation?

476
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:51,994
Hey!

477
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,376
Come here.

478
00:34:54,413 --> 00:34:55,949
Take him away.

479
00:34:56,986 --> 00:34:57,792
Arrest me if you want.

480
00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:00,902
But from tomorrow, you'll only get
vegetables if you pay in our currency.

481
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:05,434
And from 26th January, the market
will be held in Islamabad!

482
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,250
Al Safa says get out Pandits!

483
00:35:24,442 --> 00:35:26,976
- Al Safa says get out Pandits!
- What is he saying?

484
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:31,853
Sir, it means Kashmiri Pandits run away.

485
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:37,805
Don't throw it away.

486
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,187
Sir! Sir!

487
00:35:39,302 --> 00:35:42,605
What are you doing?
Why are you throwing the food?

488
00:35:42,912 --> 00:35:46,483
We won't let these
infidels eat our grains.

489
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,824
We won't! We won't! We won't!

490
00:35:49,862 --> 00:35:53,894
Then what will we eat!

491
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:58,272
Sir, you had come to my college,
you had given me a certificate too.

492
00:35:58,464 --> 00:36:00,614
I am a Gold Medalist, sir.

493
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,688
They have stopped selling
groceries to us, sir.

494
00:36:02,803 --> 00:36:05,645
Pandits are being killed
if they open their shops.

495
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:09,254
We are out of food, sir!

496
00:36:09,754 --> 00:36:14,131
The grocery that's meant for
us is taken away by these women, sir.

497
00:36:15,398 --> 00:36:19,354
Our people are dying, sir.

498
00:36:20,582 --> 00:36:23,155
They refuse us treatment in the hospitals.

499
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:26,150
And now they are stopping our food supply.

500
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,491
Please do something, sir.

501
00:36:30,144 --> 00:36:34,714
Who will help us if not you, sir?

502
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:39,898
Al Safa says run away Kashmiri Pandits!

503
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,936
We have received an intelligence report
that something is about to go very wrong.

504
00:37:04,934 --> 00:37:07,622
Tika Lal Taploo was
shot dead in the market.

505
00:37:09,043 --> 00:37:13,190
Taploo was the most popular
leader after Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.

506
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:16,147
Both Razdan and Bhan
were intelligence officers.

507
00:37:16,262 --> 00:37:19,373
JKLF's commander Bitta
killed them in broad daylight.

508
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,754
What can be worse than that?

509
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:25,555
Their goal is to end
all Kashmiri Hindu leadership.

510
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:29,357
I interviewed some people, Downtown.

511
00:37:29,856 --> 00:37:33,043
They believe...
they will soon have Freedom.

512
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,194
Uncle, you seem to know everything.

513
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,614
Why don't you telecast it?

514
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:40,032
My job is to record the
interviews and forward them.

515
00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:43,142
It's not my job to telecast it.

516
00:37:43,258 --> 00:37:44,832
Then why do you call
yourself a journalist?

517
00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:46,982
Call yourself a postman.

518
00:37:47,405 --> 00:37:52,205
Showing fake news is not as
harmful as hiding the truth.

519
00:37:52,742 --> 00:37:54,854
Why don't you just say
you don't have the courage?

520
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:59,270
We are all just trying
to stay alive in Kashmir.

521
00:38:00,538 --> 00:38:05,030
And there is nothing more courageous
than staying alive, Pushkar Nath.

522
00:38:05,146 --> 00:38:06,528
- Do you get that?
- Father?

523
00:38:06,643 --> 00:38:08,717
- Yes?
- Here, take the Nadru-Monj

524
00:38:08,832 --> 00:38:10,330
- What about the tea?
- It's coming too.

525
00:38:10,445 --> 00:38:12,902
Bring tea for all of them

526
00:38:13,862 --> 00:38:15,706
Why don't you talk to the Chief Minister?

527
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:18,624
You are a Divisional Commissioner.
It is a big post.

528
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,506
The Chief Minister?

529
00:38:20,582 --> 00:38:25,037
If he gets a break from playing golf and
Giving bike rides to Bollywood heroines.

530
00:38:29,952 --> 00:38:32,102
Why don't you talk to the Prime Minister?

531
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,562
He is a youth leader.

532
00:38:33,638 --> 00:38:36,058
You think I haven't tried?

533
00:38:36,134 --> 00:38:37,402
What did he say?

534
00:38:37,555 --> 00:38:42,048
He said, "I know that the
situation in Kashmir is quite tense."

535
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:46,502
"But I cannot interfere. The
CM is my friend. He will get offended."

536
00:38:46,771 --> 00:38:52,032
So, the country can burn down
but the friendship should stay intact.

537
00:38:52,454 --> 00:38:54,298
It's been going on since 1947.

538
00:38:54,758 --> 00:38:56,794
This Friendship-Before-Nation policy.

539
00:38:57,677 --> 00:38:59,712
Who sowed these seeds?

540
00:38:59,827 --> 00:39:01,133
Mr. Sheikh.

541
00:39:01,325 --> 00:39:02,822
There is a saying about him.

542
00:39:02,976 --> 00:39:05,011
He is a Nationalist in Delhi,

543
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:10,042
A Communist in Jammu
and Communalist in Kashmir.

544
00:39:10,195 --> 00:39:12,691
That's the definition of a Secularist.

545
00:39:12,998 --> 00:39:17,683
The Indian Government is ignoring Kashmir
like it was never a part of the country.

546
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:23,635
Sir!

547
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,786
They just killed a judge!

548
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:27,130
Which judge?

549
00:39:27,206 --> 00:39:30,970
- Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!
- Srinagar High Court Judge, Neelkanth Ganjoo

550
00:39:31,046 --> 00:39:34,349
has been shot dead in broad daylight at
Hari Singh Market by terrorists.

551
00:39:34,618 --> 00:39:37,075
The JKLF has claimed responsibility for it.

552
00:39:37,536 --> 00:39:40,109
JKLF was formed by Maqbool Bhat.

553
00:39:40,186 --> 00:39:43,142
Who robbed a bank and killed its manager,

554
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:46,598
hijacked and blew up an
Indian Airlines Plane,

555
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:50,016
and killed CID officer Amar Chand.

556
00:39:50,515 --> 00:39:53,702
Justice Ganjoo had found him guilty
and had sentenced him to death.

557
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:03,302
Good morning, Mr. Dutt.

558
00:40:03,418 --> 00:40:05,376
- Good morning, Mr.
- Good morning.

559
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:06,490
- Good morning, officers.
- Bye.

560
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:07,296
Let's go.

561
00:40:07,373 --> 00:40:08,218
Bye, darling.

562
00:40:10,982 --> 00:40:11,942
Hi!

563
00:40:12,058 --> 00:40:13,594
- How are you?
- I am fine.

564
00:40:14,054 --> 00:40:15,206
Want a plane?

565
00:40:15,552 --> 00:40:16,666
Yes.

566
00:40:17,587 --> 00:40:19,123
I've got something for you.

567
00:40:19,738 --> 00:40:21,005
This is for you. Want to fly?

568
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,117
Take this.

569
00:40:23,693 --> 00:40:24,538
Thank you.

570
00:40:24,614 --> 00:40:25,382
Welcome.

571
00:40:25,574 --> 00:40:26,611
Oh, that's for me?

572
00:40:26,688 --> 00:40:27,302
- Yes.
- Thank you so much.

573
00:40:27,456 --> 00:40:28,262
So beautiful.

574
00:40:28,454 --> 00:40:29,184
God bless you.

575
00:40:29,222 --> 00:40:29,952
Bye-bye.

576
00:40:30,029 --> 00:40:31,258
Bye.

577
00:41:29,434 --> 00:41:32,467
What are you waiting for?
Get them!

578
00:42:07,142 --> 00:42:11,174
From every city only
one slogan will rise!

579
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,480
Freedom!

580
00:42:12,557 --> 00:42:17,011
From every village only
one slogan will rise!

581
00:42:17,088 --> 00:42:18,278
Freedom!

582
00:42:18,355 --> 00:42:22,464
From every mosque only
one slogan will rise!

583
00:42:22,502 --> 00:42:23,654
Freedom!

584
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:27,725
From every school only
one slogan will rise!

585
00:42:27,802 --> 00:42:28,992
Freedom!

586
00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:30,989
Every other kid will scream,

587
00:42:31,066 --> 00:42:33,792
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

588
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:41,894
Hello, Mr. Brahma Dutt.

589
00:42:41,971 --> 00:42:42,778
Tell me.

590
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,966
Sir, the situation is really bad.

591
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:47,386
The DGP is aware of this.

592
00:42:47,808 --> 00:42:51,533
An attack on our Air Force
Officers is an attack on our Government.

593
00:42:52,262 --> 00:42:56,563
Kashmiri Pandits are
being identified and targeted.

594
00:42:56,986 --> 00:42:59,558
JKLF has issued an open threat.

595
00:42:59,712 --> 00:43:02,822
"Kashmir Pandits leave Kashmir."

596
00:43:02,976 --> 00:43:05,126
It's just a drama.
I know their game plan.

597
00:43:05,203 --> 00:43:07,507
This isn't a drama, sir.
It's a fact.

598
00:43:08,314 --> 00:43:10,349
They are burning Indian flags.

599
00:43:10,656 --> 00:43:13,882
They have put Pakistani
flags on Lal Chowk.

600
00:43:14,534 --> 00:43:15,802
So?

601
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,222
Why don't you do something about it?

602
00:43:17,798 --> 00:43:18,912
What should we do, sir?

603
00:43:18,989 --> 00:43:23,597
The Central Government refuses
to respond to any of my requests.

604
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:26,938
Your office overrules all my decisions.

605
00:43:27,245 --> 00:43:33,504
JKLF openly gets help
from your Party Office.

606
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:36,806
Are you here lobbying for them?

607
00:43:36,883 --> 00:43:41,453
Sir, you want to run a government
by dividing the population?

608
00:43:41,837 --> 00:43:44,947
This is a war on our civilisation.

609
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:49,862
A Jihad against India's ancient heritage.

610
00:43:50,246 --> 00:43:54,816
Pakistani sympathisers are
orchestrating this war against India

611
00:43:55,123 --> 00:43:57,005
both from Indian and Pakistani grounds.

612
00:43:57,235 --> 00:44:01,651
And our Government
is helping them succeed.

613
00:44:05,146 --> 00:44:06,950
This is Kashmir.

614
00:44:07,027 --> 00:44:08,870
We are Independent.

615
00:44:09,408 --> 00:44:10,944
We have our constitution here.

616
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,210
Our culture. Our flags.

617
00:44:13,325 --> 00:44:15,667
We will do what we want to do.

618
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:25,382
And Mr. Brahma Dutt, I think
you have come here as an Indian spy.

619
00:44:27,533 --> 00:44:29,990
That's why I am snatching
all your powers.

620
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,450
You...

621
00:44:33,907 --> 00:44:35,251
are suspended.

622
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:05,702
Speak out! Your words are free.

623
00:45:05,856 --> 00:45:07,891
Raise your voice!

624
00:45:07,968 --> 00:45:09,926
Speak up! Your tongue is still your own.

625
00:45:10,042 --> 00:45:11,770
Raise your voice!

626
00:45:11,846 --> 00:45:14,074
Your body remains yours ramrod, erect.

627
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,840
Raise your voice!

628
00:45:15,917 --> 00:45:17,914
Speak out! Your life is still your own.

629
00:45:18,029 --> 00:45:19,834
Raise your voice!

630
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:21,792
Your body remains yours ramrod, erect.

631
00:45:21,907 --> 00:45:23,750
Raise your voice!

632
00:45:23,904 --> 00:45:25,978
Speak out! Your life is still your own.

633
00:45:26,093 --> 00:45:27,936
Raise your voice!

634
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:30,048
The short time left to you is enough.

635
00:45:30,163 --> 00:45:32,006
Raise your voice!

636
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:33,965
Speak out! Your life is still your own.

637
00:45:34,118 --> 00:45:36,422
Raise your voice!

638
00:45:37,037 --> 00:45:39,072
Come, I need to talk to you.

639
00:45:39,494 --> 00:45:40,877
Krishna, I hope you understand

640
00:45:40,954 --> 00:45:43,142
That you are contesting for
Student Council President's post?

641
00:45:43,296 --> 00:45:44,102
- Hmm?
- Yep.

642
00:45:44,256 --> 00:45:46,138
It's not some junior post.

643
00:45:46,253 --> 00:45:47,789
It is a matter of prestige.

644
00:45:47,904 --> 00:45:50,016
The media will be following
this election closely.

645
00:45:50,131 --> 00:45:51,898
And you have to win.
We don't have a choice.

646
00:45:51,974 --> 00:45:52,742
Yes, ma'am.

647
00:45:52,896 --> 00:45:54,893
- I'm trying my level best.
- No, you're not.

648
00:45:55,891 --> 00:45:57,965
You are not giving your best.

649
00:45:58,618 --> 00:46:01,574
You are unable to connect
with our students.

650
00:46:02,688 --> 00:46:05,530
Don't be impressed by this sloganeering.

651
00:46:05,722 --> 00:46:08,371
Most of the students are
still suspicious about you.

652
00:46:08,486 --> 00:46:09,792
Suspicious about me? But why?

653
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:13,786
Because most of our
voters are Kashmiri Muslims.

654
00:46:13,862 --> 00:46:15,782
And you are a Pandit.

655
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:19,430
It's not like I like
to quote this again and again,

656
00:46:19,507 --> 00:46:21,389
But this an electoral reality.

657
00:46:21,466 --> 00:46:23,731
But ma'am,
we cannot stay divided forever.

658
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,574
Isn't there a solution for this?

659
00:46:25,805 --> 00:46:26,995
There is.

660
00:46:27,072 --> 00:46:28,800
There is a solution.

661
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:31,795
But you will have to make a choice,

662
00:46:32,026 --> 00:46:34,867
whether you want to stand
with the problem or the solution.

663
00:46:35,098 --> 00:46:36,134
The solution.

664
00:46:38,707 --> 00:46:40,166
Good.

665
00:46:41,088 --> 00:46:42,624
People believe in God?

666
00:46:42,662 --> 00:46:43,930
Yes.

667
00:46:44,006 --> 00:46:47,654
They don't believe in him
because he comes down helps them.

668
00:46:49,229 --> 00:46:54,182
People believe in God
because they have this hope

669
00:46:55,027 --> 00:46:58,138
That one day God
will do something for them.

670
00:46:58,368 --> 00:47:03,590
And this hope, is God!

671
00:47:04,474 --> 00:47:06,317
You have to become their God.

672
00:47:06,432 --> 00:47:08,582
You have to become their Messiah.

673
00:47:10,157 --> 00:47:11,424
I'm nobody's God, ma'am.

674
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:12,845
For God's sake, please.

675
00:47:13,037 --> 00:47:14,342
I don't have any solution either.

676
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:16,531
That's the best part, Krishna.

677
00:47:16,646 --> 00:47:18,144
You don't need to provide a solution.

678
00:47:18,182 --> 00:47:20,794
You just need to give them
the hope that there is some solution.

679
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:22,829
But there isn't one.

680
00:47:24,749 --> 00:47:26,285
You're so naive, Krishna.

681
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,086
Just treat politics like it's a story.

682
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:35,155
If there is a hero in it
then it also needs a villain.

683
00:47:35,462 --> 00:47:37,382
Who is the villain of your story?

684
00:47:38,342 --> 00:47:40,723
- Terrorism.
- Why does terrorism exist?

685
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:42,067
Because of oppression.

686
00:47:42,144 --> 00:47:43,526
Who is the oppressor?

687
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,525
State.

688
00:47:44,602 --> 00:47:45,523
Exactly.

689
00:47:45,677 --> 00:47:48,442
Which is Government of India.

690
00:47:48,864 --> 00:47:50,208
Understood?

691
00:47:50,938 --> 00:47:53,318
Blaming terrorism won't help.

692
00:47:53,395 --> 00:47:54,970
Pin it on the Government.

693
00:47:55,085 --> 00:47:58,349
You will get the power only
if you make Government your villain.

694
00:47:58,426 --> 00:48:00,154
The power to negotiate better.

695
00:48:01,766 --> 00:48:04,685
That's extortion ma'am, not negotiation.

696
00:48:06,067 --> 00:48:07,872
That's politics.

697
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:13,478
You can change the fate of this
country only if you have this power.

698
00:48:13,862 --> 00:48:15,782
Political power.

699
00:48:17,357 --> 00:48:19,008
Everything else is rubbish.

700
00:48:20,582 --> 00:48:22,272
Now go and try harder.

701
00:48:22,502 --> 00:48:23,770
You must win.

702
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,982
Grandpa,
I told you to stop doing charity.

703
00:48:59,174 --> 00:49:00,787
Why don't you listen to me?

704
00:49:00,902 --> 00:49:04,397
I won't die until
they remove Article 370.

705
00:49:04,512 --> 00:49:06,509
You can't even see properly.

706
00:49:06,662 --> 00:49:09,734
What if you meet with an accident?
What will we do?

707
00:49:10,234 --> 00:49:12,614
Enough about me.
Now let's talk about you.

708
00:49:12,998 --> 00:49:15,610
You have started hiding
everything from me.

709
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,146
What did I hide?

710
00:49:17,222 --> 00:49:19,104
I met Mr. Kaul.

711
00:49:19,411 --> 00:49:22,214
He said you made the headlines.

712
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:25,862
You are running for
Student's President at ANU.

713
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:28,435
You were shouting slogans of Freedom.

714
00:49:28,627 --> 00:49:30,317
You are being prosecuted for sedition.

715
00:49:30,394 --> 00:49:32,237
Is it true?

716
00:49:36,998 --> 00:49:41,414
So now you'll fight for our enemies, huh?

717
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:45,523
How long do you plan
on carrying forward this hate?

718
00:49:45,869 --> 00:49:47,443
Can't you forgive them?

719
00:49:47,674 --> 00:49:49,440
Say sorry to each other and move on.

720
00:49:49,747 --> 00:49:52,090
Say sorry and move on?

721
00:49:52,704 --> 00:49:56,429
Say sorry to those
responsible for our genocide?

722
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,885
Come on grandpa, it was not a genocide.
Please.

723
00:50:00,845 --> 00:50:04,800
I just don't understand till when
you guys plan to carry this fake label?

724
00:50:05,299 --> 00:50:06,182
You guys?

725
00:50:06,259 --> 00:50:07,680
Who are you?

726
00:50:07,718 --> 00:50:09,638
I don't believe in any identities.

727
00:50:09,754 --> 00:50:13,594
But you believe in the identity
responsible for killing Kashmiri Pandits!

728
00:50:14,592 --> 00:50:16,589
They died because of their own mistake.

729
00:50:16,858 --> 00:50:18,854
This is bound to happen
if you oppress the minorities.

730
00:50:18,893 --> 00:50:21,734
They aren't a minority, we are.

731
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,539
2% minority.

732
00:50:23,693 --> 00:50:25,920
Minority amongst minorities.

733
00:50:26,112 --> 00:50:29,760
We are being treated as refugees in
our own country since the past 30 years.

734
00:50:29,914 --> 00:50:31,680
We are not refugees!

735
00:50:31,718 --> 00:50:32,986
We are not minorities!

736
00:50:33,139 --> 00:50:35,520
We are Kashmiri Pandits from Kashmir!

737
00:50:35,789 --> 00:50:38,899
This land belongs to us!
We have a right over it!

738
00:50:38,938 --> 00:50:40,781
Grandpa, at least let
me finish cutting your nails.

739
00:50:40,819 --> 00:50:43,584
We were 100% before they came.

740
00:50:43,776 --> 00:50:45,619
They converted us.

741
00:50:45,888 --> 00:50:48,192
We can proudly list our ancestors
all the way back to 25 generations.

742
00:50:48,269 --> 00:50:49,459
Can they do that?

743
00:50:49,728 --> 00:50:51,379
Even their surnames belong to us!

744
00:50:51,763 --> 00:50:54,144
Kaul, Pandit, Bhatt, Mattoo.

745
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:59,942
Our Kashmir is the
land of Gods and Saints.

746
00:51:00,518 --> 00:51:04,128
Our Kashmir is the land
where Shankaracharya meditated.

747
00:51:04,627 --> 00:51:07,238
Our Kashmir is the land where
the Panchtantra was penned down.

748
00:51:07,354 --> 00:51:09,619
What do you even know about Kashmir?

749
00:51:09,696 --> 00:51:10,963
I know enough.

750
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,342
You have been telling me stories
of Kashmir ever since I was a kid.

751
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,339
Have you ever given this a thought?

752
00:51:16,378 --> 00:51:18,259
If Kashmiri Pandits had
such a glorious history...

753
00:51:18,336 --> 00:51:20,026
Then why did they convert?

754
00:51:20,064 --> 00:51:21,869
Because they were terrorised!

755
00:51:22,214 --> 00:51:24,518
Through the swords of the Sufis.

756
00:51:25,325 --> 00:51:27,360
You will only concentrate on your studies.

757
00:51:27,974 --> 00:51:29,318
No politics.

758
00:51:30,432 --> 00:51:33,389
Politics has only one end...
destruction.

759
00:51:34,118 --> 00:51:34,848
Death.

760
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,422
So you want the fear of death
to make me a coward?

761
00:51:40,339 --> 00:51:41,645
I feel very cold.

762
00:51:43,488 --> 00:51:45,024
I feel very cold.

763
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,288
Bring me a kangri, please.

764
00:51:48,403 --> 00:51:50,899
It's freezing cold.

765
00:51:51,053 --> 00:51:52,013
Sorry, grandpa.

766
00:51:52,128 --> 00:51:56,314
It has snowed in Habba Kadal. See.

767
00:51:56,429 --> 00:51:59,194
Oh snow fall please,
Oh brother come please.

768
00:51:59,309 --> 00:52:04,685
Oh snow... bring me a blanket,
I am shivering.

769
00:52:05,645 --> 00:52:08,909
Oh snow...
See it has snowed in Baramulla too.

770
00:52:09,024 --> 00:52:13,632
Also, in Shankaracharya.
I am shivering.

771
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,664
I am feeling cold.

772
00:52:21,734 --> 00:52:22,694
Grandpa.

773
00:52:22,733 --> 00:52:26,650
You won't get into politics.

774
00:52:28,339 --> 00:52:29,683
Oh snow fall please...

775
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,219
Oh brother come please.

776
00:52:31,334 --> 00:52:33,600
Oh snow fall please.

777
00:52:55,642 --> 00:52:57,754
It's quite cold.

778
00:52:57,984 --> 00:52:59,904
Drinks?

779
00:53:05,203 --> 00:53:06,854
I'm impressed.

780
00:53:07,085 --> 00:53:10,118
It's been 30 years and you
still remember my favourite whiskey?

781
00:53:10,464 --> 00:53:12,154
I appreciate it.

782
00:53:15,994 --> 00:53:17,222
Tell me when.

783
00:53:17,299 --> 00:53:18,182
That's it.

784
00:53:18,259 --> 00:53:19,565
Okay.

785
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,944
Vishnu?

786
00:53:24,749 --> 00:53:25,939
Awesome.

787
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,667
My Rum.

788
00:53:28,013 --> 00:53:29,933
I thought you wouldn't remember.

789
00:53:32,045 --> 00:53:33,850
Doctor?

790
00:53:34,387 --> 00:53:36,384
No, I must avoid.

791
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:38,880
We are getting together after 30 years.

792
00:53:38,918 --> 00:53:40,838
We should have at least one token drink.

793
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,142
Okay.

794
00:53:43,334 --> 00:53:45,024
I'll have one.

795
00:53:45,254 --> 00:53:46,752
With soda and--

796
00:53:46,867 --> 00:53:48,365
Bitters?

797
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:53,050
Anything for you, young man?

798
00:53:54,048 --> 00:53:56,045
No sir, thanks. I'm good.

799
00:53:56,198 --> 00:53:58,234
It's Durga.

800
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,192
Calling from US.

801
00:54:00,269 --> 00:54:02,650
- She wants to say hello.
- Oh.

802
00:54:03,149 --> 00:54:04,454
Remember him?

803
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:06,374
Oh my God, she's grown up.

804
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:07,834
Hi, Mahesh uncle.

805
00:54:08,218 --> 00:54:09,600
Where are you now?

806
00:54:09,754 --> 00:54:12,365
I'm in DC. Where are you now?

807
00:54:12,403 --> 00:54:14,131
I'm in Houston.

808
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,358
We must meet up.

809
00:54:16,742 --> 00:54:19,008
I am sure you'll recognise him.

810
00:54:19,085 --> 00:54:20,045
Hi, kiddo.

811
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:22,080
Hi, Hari uncle.

812
00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:25,114
Hello! Remember me?

813
00:54:25,229 --> 00:54:27,264
- Toffee uncle!
- Right!

814
00:54:27,648 --> 00:54:28,723
Good, good.

815
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,259
Hey! Cheers, Dad.

816
00:54:30,912 --> 00:54:31,680
Thank you.

817
00:54:31,834 --> 00:54:32,909
And that's Krishna.

818
00:54:33,024 --> 00:54:34,214
- Who?
- Thank you.

819
00:54:34,253 --> 00:54:38,707
Remember Pushkar uncle's grandson Shiva?

820
00:54:38,861 --> 00:54:40,589
He's his younger brother.

821
00:54:40,742 --> 00:54:43,354
- Hi, Krishna. How are you?
- Hello.

822
00:54:43,392 --> 00:54:45,888
I am sorry to hear about Pushkar uncle.

823
00:54:46,003 --> 00:54:47,040
That's okay.

824
00:54:47,078 --> 00:54:49,843
And I have so many fond memories of Shiva.

825
00:54:50,074 --> 00:54:51,994
We used to play a lot in the snow.

826
00:54:52,224 --> 00:54:53,453
I miss him a lot.

827
00:54:53,568 --> 00:54:55,565
- Life was unfair to him.
- Cheers.

828
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,485
Can you believe this?

829
00:54:57,754 --> 00:54:59,904
One accident took my
entire family away from me.

830
00:54:59,981 --> 00:55:01,632
What?
Accident?

831
00:55:02,323 --> 00:55:03,514
Yeah, why?

832
00:55:05,318 --> 00:55:07,200
Can I talk to Mom?

833
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:08,774
Sure.

834
00:55:10,579 --> 00:55:12,230
Mom? What?

835
00:55:13,114 --> 00:55:16,992
Durga, I am sorry I didn't inform you.

836
00:55:17,069 --> 00:55:20,294
I didn't get a chance.

837
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:22,829
Let's talk tomorrow, okay?

838
00:55:22,982 --> 00:55:24,787
Okay. See you.

839
00:55:24,864 --> 00:55:26,323
Bye.

840
00:55:27,053 --> 00:55:28,474
Ma'am?

841
00:55:28,896 --> 00:55:32,314
Why was your daughter so
shocked to hear about the accident?

842
00:55:32,582 --> 00:55:38,227
Well, she doesn't know what
happened here after January 1990.

843
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:46,829
Do you have any pictures of my parents?

844
00:55:46,867 --> 00:55:49,133
Yes, I do.

845
00:55:50,054 --> 00:55:55,699
Pushkar used to dress up as Lord
Shiva for Maha Shivratri.

846
00:55:56,198 --> 00:55:58,118
Look.

847
00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:13,056
Which one of them are my parents?

848
00:56:23,923 --> 00:56:25,459
Sharda.

849
00:56:28,147 --> 00:56:30,182
Your Dad.

850
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:34,944
And Shiva.

851
00:56:41,587 --> 00:56:45,734
Pushkar never told you?

852
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:47,616
No.

853
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:51,994
He had said he left this place
empty-handed during the exodus.

854
00:56:52,032 --> 00:56:54,490
He couldn't take anything along.

855
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,984
Almost everyone left empty-handed
during the exodus.

856
00:56:59,136 --> 00:57:05,280
Some had to run with just one shoe on.

857
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:07,123
Stop, Doctor!

858
00:57:07,584 --> 00:57:08,813
Stop.

859
00:57:12,384 --> 00:57:16,570
When 500,000 Pandits were killed and
made to run away,

860
00:57:17,107 --> 00:57:20,947
That is not an exodus, it's a genocide.

861
00:57:23,213 --> 00:57:26,054
Sorry sir, it was not a genocide, please.

862
00:57:26,784 --> 00:57:27,744
Oh really?

863
00:57:28,704 --> 00:57:29,664
What was it then?

864
00:57:29,933 --> 00:57:30,970
Tell me.

865
00:57:31,123 --> 00:57:32,429
Come on, tell me.

866
00:57:33,965 --> 00:57:35,693
I would call it dirty politics.

867
00:57:36,768 --> 00:57:40,224
And the fact is that only 200,000
Kashmiri Pandits left Kashmir.

868
00:57:41,069 --> 00:57:42,874
And the unfortunate ones who died

869
00:57:42,989 --> 00:57:45,485
were killed by Pakistani
militants and not Kashmiris.

870
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:47,213
Why should Kashmiris suffer for it?

871
00:57:48,403 --> 00:57:49,440
Oh.

872
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:55,392
So, Farooq Malik Bitta

873
00:57:56,582 --> 00:57:59,424
is a Pakistani terrorist?

874
00:58:02,419 --> 00:58:06,490
He was your grandfather
Pushkar's student.

875
00:58:06,874 --> 00:58:08,678
Right. So just imagine...

876
00:58:09,331 --> 00:58:11,174
Who turned these students into terrorists?

877
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:15,091
What else do you expect when innocent
boys are dragged behind cars

878
00:58:15,168 --> 00:58:18,010
and blamed for rape, huh? What do you
expect these tortured people to do?

879
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,045
You expect them to worship us instead of
picking up guns?

880
00:58:20,352 --> 00:58:21,734
No, sir. This is what will happen.

881
00:58:27,994 --> 00:58:29,299
Tortured people, huh?

882
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:37,325
Kashmiri Pandits never
Picked up a gun.

883
00:58:38,669 --> 00:58:39,782
Why?

884
00:59:00,211 --> 00:59:02,438
So, what happened on the
night of 19th January?

885
00:59:04,512 --> 00:59:07,200
My father died in a scooter accident.

886
00:59:07,699 --> 00:59:08,774
He wasn't murdered!

887
00:59:09,005 --> 00:59:12,000
If what you are saying is true,
then why didn't my grandpa tell me about it?

888
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,765
They were my parents!

889
00:59:16,378 --> 00:59:19,027
Broken souls don't speak.

890
00:59:20,602 --> 00:59:22,253
They must be heard.

891
00:59:32,928 --> 00:59:35,309
Was my mother murdered as well?

892
00:59:39,149 --> 00:59:43,104
If, yes, then where is my brother Shiva?

893
00:59:45,024 --> 00:59:47,290
Why didn't he try to contact me?

894
00:59:47,635 --> 00:59:49,670
Hmm? Either me or grandpa?

895
00:59:53,203 --> 00:59:55,085
All of you know everything.

896
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:58,118
Except me.

897
01:00:10,022 --> 01:00:11,789
What is the truth?

898
01:00:19,238 --> 01:00:21,120
Please tell me the truth.

899
01:00:22,003 --> 01:00:24,845
Was my mother killed and
thrown into the Jhelum River?

900
01:00:27,149 --> 01:00:29,914
Or did they kidnap her
and take her to Pakistan?

901
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:35,059
What's the truth?

902
01:00:36,902 --> 01:00:38,592
Indian agents!

903
01:00:38,746 --> 01:00:40,819
Indian spies!

904
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:45,965
If you don't leave,
we'll set your houses on fire.

905
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:48,154
This is your last warning.

906
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:49,498
Leave!

907
01:00:49,574 --> 01:00:53,568
Only Islamic Law will be
followed in Kashmir henceforth!

908
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:56,218
Inshallah!

909
01:00:56,294 --> 01:01:02,669
Kashmir needs to be repopulated as
Pakistan with Hindu women, without their men.

910
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:06,125
Leave your wives behind, infidels!

911
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:11,309
Kashmir will be made Pakistan. Without
Hindu men, with Hindu women.

912
01:01:11,462 --> 01:01:12,538
Inshallah!

913
01:01:12,614 --> 01:01:16,800
The great slogan is Allah is the greatest!

914
01:01:16,838 --> 01:01:19,834
Convert, leave or die!

915
01:01:19,949 --> 01:01:23,520
Convert, leave or die!

916
01:01:27,782 --> 01:01:30,470
Convert, leave or die!

917
01:01:30,509 --> 01:01:33,274
Convert, leave or die!

918
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:35,923
Convert, leave or die!

919
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,880
- The great slogan is Allah is the greatest!
- He's not upstairs.

920
01:01:38,918 --> 01:01:41,914
The great slogan is Allah is the greatest!

921
01:01:42,029 --> 01:01:44,678
The great slogan is Allah is the greatest!

922
01:01:44,794 --> 01:01:47,405
The great slogan is Allah is the greatest!

923
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:50,323
The great slogan is Allah is the greatest!

924
01:01:53,664 --> 01:01:58,733
Oh mother!

925
01:02:44,582 --> 01:02:48,576
Pandit, if you hadn't been my teacher.

926
01:02:48,653 --> 01:02:51,264
And if she wouldn't
have been your daughter-in-law...

927
01:02:51,533 --> 01:02:52,838
Then I would have married her.

928
01:02:55,565 --> 01:02:57,101
At least one infidel would have been converted.

929
01:03:01,824 --> 01:03:05,088
(Baby Krishna crying)

930
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:26,016
Save my child, Doctor!
Save my child, Doctor!

931
01:03:29,702 --> 01:03:32,544
- Hello?
- Terrorists have shot my son.

932
01:03:32,582 --> 01:03:34,810
Come here with an ambulance right away.

933
01:03:34,848 --> 01:03:36,307
Save my son.

934
01:03:36,384 --> 01:03:38,918
Bandage his bullet wound
with a piece of cloth.

935
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:41,414
How many bullet wounds should I bandage?

936
01:03:42,067 --> 01:03:44,794
I'll fall short of clothes
trying to bandage them all.

937
01:03:45,408 --> 01:03:47,558
Come here with an ambulance immediately.

938
01:03:47,789 --> 01:03:49,747
Yes, yes, Pushkar.

939
01:03:49,824 --> 01:03:51,859
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

940
01:03:51,898 --> 01:03:54,509
Wrap him with clothes.

941
01:03:56,083 --> 01:04:00,038
He is still breathing.

942
01:04:08,026 --> 01:04:08,947
Doctor!

943
01:04:09,024 --> 01:04:10,829
He needs blood.
O Negative.

944
01:04:10,982 --> 01:04:13,210
We haven't received a supply
of blood in a few days.

945
01:04:13,325 --> 01:04:14,054
Then get it from someplace else.

946
01:04:14,093 --> 01:04:15,782
O Negative is a rare blood group.

947
01:04:15,974 --> 01:04:17,933
- With the curfew going on--
- Then use a patient's blood.

948
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,314
How can he use a patient's blood?

949
01:04:37,363 --> 01:04:38,323
Sir!

950
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,013
I am O Negative.

951
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,894
My blood group is O Negative.

952
01:04:47,539 --> 01:04:48,998
I have started the blood transfusion.

953
01:04:49,229 --> 01:04:50,918
Your brother will survive.

954
01:04:53,414 --> 01:04:54,874
Listen carefully.

955
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:58,944
India's illegal occupation
over Kashmir ends today.

956
01:04:59,251 --> 01:05:03,974
Only Allah's followers will
live on this holy land here henceforth.

957
01:05:04,013 --> 01:05:05,203
Who will get to live here?

958
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,240
Allah's followers!

959
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:07,546
Who will get to live here?

960
01:05:07,584 --> 01:05:08,467
Allah's followers!

961
01:05:08,544 --> 01:05:09,619
What are you doing?

962
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:10,810
What are you doing?

963
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,382
I have given him enough blood.

964
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:16,339
I will decide when
he has had enough blood.

965
01:05:19,219 --> 01:05:20,563
What are you doing?

966
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,293
He will die.

967
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:24,250
Your Army has shot at my brother.

968
01:05:24,672 --> 01:05:26,400
They should know:

969
01:05:26,554 --> 01:05:29,318
We will kill two for
every bullet they shoot at us.

970
01:05:30,662 --> 01:05:32,352
Allah's decree:

971
01:05:32,544 --> 01:05:36,730
No doctors or nurses will treat infidels.

972
01:05:36,845 --> 01:05:38,266
Who will they not treat?

973
01:05:38,304 --> 01:05:39,264
Infidels!

974
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:41,760
- Whose decree is this?
- Allah's!

975
01:05:41,798 --> 01:05:43,718
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

976
01:05:43,834 --> 01:05:45,792
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

977
01:05:45,869 --> 01:05:47,904
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

978
01:05:47,942 --> 01:05:50,170
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

979
01:05:50,285 --> 01:05:52,358
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

980
01:05:52,474 --> 01:05:54,470
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

981
01:05:54,509 --> 01:05:56,736
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

982
01:05:56,813 --> 01:06:00,000
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

983
01:06:00,038 --> 01:06:05,184
We have just learnt that Jammu and Kashmir's
Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah has resigned.

984
01:06:05,798 --> 01:06:09,523
As you all know the situation
in Kashmir is very tense.

985
01:06:09,562 --> 01:06:13,939
On one hand there is religious
tension and on the other hand...

986
01:06:14,016 --> 01:06:16,589
This is so ironic.

987
01:06:18,202 --> 01:06:20,890
Kashmir is believed to be heaven on Earth.

988
01:06:22,042 --> 01:06:26,842
But the people who are turning it into hell

989
01:06:28,186 --> 01:06:31,181
are doing so to ensure
their place in heaven.

990
01:06:34,867 --> 01:06:37,248
It's all going to end, Laxmi.

991
01:06:38,592 --> 01:06:41,280
India is slowly losing Kashmir.

992
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:49,843
Hello?

993
01:06:51,264 --> 01:06:53,184
My son has died, Brahma Dutt.

994
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:57,600
They have asked us
to leave Kashmir overnight.

995
01:06:59,366 --> 01:07:04,934
Not just us, there are
500,000 more Kashmir Pandits.

996
01:07:05,165 --> 01:07:06,509
Don't worry.

997
01:07:06,624 --> 01:07:07,814
I'll do something.

998
01:07:07,891 --> 01:07:09,696
You won't do anything, Brahma Dutt.

999
01:07:09,773 --> 01:07:11,424
Even you are one of them.

1000
01:07:12,038 --> 01:07:15,302
When India will burn like Kashmir someday

1001
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:21,638
Remember that you too had a hand in it.

1002
01:07:23,059 --> 01:07:26,707
I promise you. You will get justice.

1003
01:07:27,859 --> 01:07:29,587
What is...

1004
01:07:30,739 --> 01:07:32,352
justice?

1005
01:07:40,493 --> 01:07:41,760
Hello?

1006
01:07:41,914 --> 01:07:43,718
Hello, Mr. Krishnan?

1007
01:07:43,949 --> 01:07:45,024
What's wrong?

1008
01:07:45,293 --> 01:07:48,480
No officer or minister is taking my calls.

1009
01:07:48,787 --> 01:07:52,243
Are they on leave or are they scared?

1010
01:07:52,666 --> 01:07:54,854
Kashmir is on fire!

1011
01:07:55,046 --> 01:07:58,925
Kashmiri Pandits are being
massacred in the streets!

1012
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:04,570
Ask the Home Minister to send the planes,
otherwise by tomorrow--

1013
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:58,598
I had personally given you
orders to protect Pushkar's family.

1014
01:08:59,174 --> 01:09:00,902
Then how did this happen?

1015
01:09:01,248 --> 01:09:05,203
Sir, we had orders from
you and from Commander Bitta.

1016
01:09:05,664 --> 01:09:08,352
You tell us,
whose order should we have followed?

1017
01:09:09,158 --> 01:09:11,424
You are fired!

1018
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,110
Sir, they have left.

1019
01:09:16,954 --> 01:09:21,139
Kashmir will become Pakistan,
without Hindu Men, with Hindu Women!

1020
01:09:21,254 --> 01:09:25,018
Kashmir will become Pakistan,
without Hindu Men, with Hindu Women!

1021
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:27,245
Convert! Leave! Or die!

1022
01:09:27,322 --> 01:09:29,280
Convert! Leave! Or die!

1023
01:09:29,318 --> 01:09:31,430
Convert! Leave! Or die!

1024
01:09:31,507 --> 01:09:33,389
Convert! Leave! Or die!

1025
01:09:33,466 --> 01:09:36,230
Convert! Leave! Or die!

1026
01:09:36,307 --> 01:09:38,880
Convert! Leave! Or die!

1027
01:09:38,918 --> 01:09:41,299
Convert! Leave! Or die!

1028
01:09:41,376 --> 01:09:43,987
Convert! Leave! Or die!

1029
01:09:44,026 --> 01:09:46,291
Convert! Leave! Or die!

1030
01:09:46,368 --> 01:09:48,710
Convert! Leave! Or die!

1031
01:09:49,248 --> 01:09:51,974
I am taking you to
Anand Kaul Premi's place.

1032
01:09:52,512 --> 01:09:53,894
He's a poet.

1033
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,158
He's friends with the Muslims.

1034
01:09:57,389 --> 01:09:59,078
He has often helped them.

1035
01:10:00,768 --> 01:10:02,765
A lot of families have
sought refuge at his place.

1036
01:10:02,803 --> 01:10:05,107
Look at how my Kashmir is burning.

1037
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:07,334
You are reporting all this, aren't you?

1038
01:10:08,986 --> 01:10:10,368
You are reporting all this, aren't you?

1039
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,862
Everyone in India should
know what we are going through.

1040
01:10:13,939 --> 01:10:16,205
Everyone will join in to support
us once they learnt about it.

1041
01:10:17,933 --> 01:10:20,198
They all left me.

1042
01:10:20,314 --> 01:10:22,579
You are the only one I can trust.

1043
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:25,114
You will report all this, won't you?

1044
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:34,291
It's a matter of a few days only,
Therefore, don't carry all of your stuff.

1045
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:40,704
Our first priority must be to
protect the honour of our womenfolk.

1046
01:10:41,549 --> 01:10:43,469
We will come back.

1047
01:10:43,622 --> 01:10:48,768
All these murderers will
be punished for their crimes.

1048
01:10:48,998 --> 01:10:52,838
The Pakistani flag at Lal Chowk...

1049
01:10:53,299 --> 01:10:58,829
This child will remove
it and hoist India's flag there.

1050
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:03,398
Our flag, your flag, my flag.

1051
01:11:04,205 --> 01:11:08,314
Once again Kashmir will
resound with the echoes of...

1052
01:11:08,659 --> 01:11:11,462
Hail... India!

1053
01:11:11,539 --> 01:11:13,344
Shush!

1054
01:11:14,074 --> 01:11:17,798
Hail India!

1055
01:11:17,914 --> 01:11:21,869
Hail India!

1056
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:27,552
Hail India!

1057
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,454
Stay silent.

1058
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:45,485
Don't make any sound,
let me see who that is.

1059
01:11:45,638 --> 01:11:47,789
Don't worry.

1060
01:11:48,902 --> 01:11:50,976
I have written many poems on them.

1061
01:11:51,744 --> 01:11:53,434
They consider me their own, don't worry.

1062
01:11:53,664 --> 01:11:57,389
They consider me as one of their own.

1063
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,074
All girls come with me to the attic.

1064
01:12:02,266 --> 01:12:03,533
Let's hide there.

1065
01:12:03,725 --> 01:12:04,800
Hurry up.

1066
01:12:04,838 --> 01:12:06,029
Let's go.

1067
01:12:06,643 --> 01:12:08,794
Hurry up.

1068
01:12:10,445 --> 01:12:11,520
Farooq Bitta?

1069
01:12:11,674 --> 01:12:13,171
Hello, Mr. Kaul.

1070
01:12:13,325 --> 01:12:14,323
Hi.

1071
01:12:14,438 --> 01:12:16,589
The situation outside is very bad.

1072
01:12:17,242 --> 01:12:19,238
I'd advise you to come with us.

1073
01:12:19,584 --> 01:12:21,389
We'll take you to a safe place.

1074
01:12:22,656 --> 01:12:24,269
But where?

1075
01:12:24,614 --> 01:12:26,074
You don't worry.

1076
01:12:26,573 --> 01:12:28,685
We'll bring you back as
soon as it's safe.

1077
01:12:29,184 --> 01:12:31,987
Father, you can't see properly at night.

1078
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:33,984
Let me come with you.

1079
01:12:35,674 --> 01:12:36,710
With pleasure.

1080
01:12:37,594 --> 01:12:38,438
Two is better than one.

1081
01:12:38,899 --> 01:12:40,128
Let's go.

1082
01:12:40,474 --> 01:12:41,933
Come on, let's go.

1083
01:12:42,163 --> 01:12:43,507
Let's go, Mr. Kaul.

1084
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,349
Come on, let's go.

1085
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:04,589
- Militants! Militants! Militants!
- Shruti! Shruti! Shruti!

1086
01:13:24,019 --> 01:13:32,429
Having snatched my heart
you have gone far off,

1087
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:40,224
Come, my love, my flowery Cupid.

1088
01:13:42,374 --> 01:13:50,323
Let us go, my friend, to gather Basil.

1089
01:13:52,205 --> 01:14:00,154
Wounding my heart with an axe,

1090
01:14:02,074 --> 01:14:12,749
He disdains to even inquire of me.

1091
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:21,005
- Come, my love, my flowery Cupid.
- Mom, I am hungry.

1092
01:14:21,274 --> 01:14:22,694
Mom, I am hungry.

1093
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:31,181
Having snatched my heart
you have gone far off,

1094
01:14:31,603 --> 01:14:40,205
Come, my love, my flowery Cupid!

1095
01:14:48,576 --> 01:14:51,725
Mom, I need to pee.

1096
01:14:52,954 --> 01:14:54,144
Stop the truck, please.

1097
01:14:54,259 --> 01:14:56,794
Driver, stop the truck please!

1098
01:15:02,285 --> 01:15:04,934
Driver, stop the truck.

1099
01:15:05,126 --> 01:15:06,739
I need to pee.

1100
01:15:09,427 --> 01:15:10,733
Come with me.

1101
01:15:11,462 --> 01:15:12,845
Come here.

1102
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:16,109
Come with me, dear.

1103
01:15:19,142 --> 01:15:21,024
Come, be careful.

1104
01:15:22,982 --> 01:15:24,288
Give me the box.

1105
01:15:24,634 --> 01:15:26,285
- Do you have the Shawl?
- Yes, here.

1106
01:15:27,706 --> 01:15:29,050
Don't worry.

1107
01:15:33,427 --> 01:15:36,998
Remove your pajama and sit.

1108
01:15:40,493 --> 01:15:42,259
No one look.

1109
01:15:47,059 --> 01:15:55,162
Having snatched my heart
you have gone far off,

1110
01:15:55,584 --> 01:16:05,069
Come, my love, my flowery Cupid!

1111
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:13,325
Let us go my friend to gather herbs.

1112
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:24,115
Heartless people make fun of me.

1113
01:16:47,155 --> 01:16:49,690
That's Mr. Koul and his son!

1114
01:17:15,763 --> 01:17:20,371
The ones who are being called victims
were actually the privileged Pandits of Kashmir.

1115
01:17:20,486 --> 01:17:22,982
While Pandits were a
minority in Kashmir,

1116
01:17:23,021 --> 01:17:29,587
They had the sole right over government
jobs, financial aids and social benefits.

1117
01:17:29,856 --> 01:17:37,267
As a result, Kashmiri Muslims, the
majority, faced atrocities and oppression.

1118
01:17:37,344 --> 01:17:40,262
And it is because of
the monopoly of the Pandits...

1119
01:17:40,301 --> 01:17:44,486
The gap between rich Pandits
and poor Muslims widened.

1120
01:17:44,563 --> 01:17:48,134
When the educated youth of
Kashmir protested about it...

1121
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:54,086
The Pandit's monopoly crumpled
and they decided to leave Kashmir.

1122
01:17:54,893 --> 01:17:56,621
This is Vishnu Ram
reporting live, from Kashmir.

1123
01:17:56,774 --> 01:17:58,733
Back to the Studio.

1124
01:18:00,576 --> 01:18:02,611
Pushkar was right.

1125
01:18:04,262 --> 01:18:11,866
Reporting fake news is not
as dangerous as hiding the truth.

1126
01:18:11,942 --> 01:18:13,171
I agree.

1127
01:18:13,517 --> 01:18:14,669
If the news can be faked,

1128
01:18:14,746 --> 01:18:17,126
you can only imagine what they
have done with our history.

1129
01:18:17,203 --> 01:18:18,547
Absolutely.

1130
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:21,312
Why didn't you report the truth?

1131
01:18:21,389 --> 01:18:22,426
Ask him.

1132
01:18:22,541 --> 01:18:24,192
Sir, I am asking you a question.

1133
01:18:24,653 --> 01:18:27,571
Why didn't you show the world
what was actually happening in Kashmir?

1134
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:30,413
I didn't have the means.

1135
01:18:30,874 --> 01:18:34,253
We didn't have these
TV Channels that you have now.

1136
01:18:34,330 --> 01:18:35,789
There was no social media either.

1137
01:18:35,904 --> 01:18:38,093
Then how does everyone
know about Babri Masjid?

1138
01:18:38,285 --> 01:18:39,130
Delhi Sikh Massacre?

1139
01:18:39,206 --> 01:18:41,280
Bhopal Gas Tragedy?
How do people know about that?

1140
01:18:41,434 --> 01:18:42,931
These things happened back in 1984.

1141
01:18:43,008 --> 01:18:45,120
Six years before 1990!

1142
01:18:45,773 --> 01:18:51,494
The market is always open for
those who are ready to be sold.

1143
01:18:52,301 --> 01:18:53,645
Market?

1144
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,104
What do you mean?

1145
01:18:55,181 --> 01:18:57,062
What are you trying to say?

1146
01:18:57,907 --> 01:18:59,405
Just come out with it.

1147
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,248
I should know what you are talking about.

1148
01:19:01,478 --> 01:19:07,930
Krishna, you know, when we police officers
want to arrest a hard-core criminal

1149
01:19:08,467 --> 01:19:13,421
we first find out who his mistress is.

1150
01:19:14,266 --> 01:19:17,030
Do you know who goes
in bed with the terrorists?

1151
01:19:17,184 --> 01:19:19,066
It's them, the media.

1152
01:19:23,712 --> 01:19:26,822
You are crossing your limits, okay?

1153
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,472
You wanted me to come out with it, right?

1154
01:19:29,549 --> 01:19:31,354
So here you go.

1155
01:19:31,546 --> 01:19:39,302
The media always addresses IS
and Al-Qaeda as 'Islamist Terrorists'.

1156
01:19:39,878 --> 01:19:44,141
But the Kashmiri terrorists of
Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba,

1157
01:19:44,256 --> 01:19:49,440
Hizbul Mujahideen and JKLF
are addressed as Rebels not Terrorists.

1158
01:19:49,594 --> 01:19:54,010
Even though IS, Al-Qaeda and
all the other terrorist organisations...

1159
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:57,734
Have the same modus operandi,
crime and source of finance.

1160
01:19:58,118 --> 01:20:00,000
They all have the same aim.

1161
01:20:00,154 --> 01:20:02,765
They want to break
Kashmir away from India...

1162
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:07,181
And have it declared
as The Islamic Republic of Kashmir.

1163
01:20:07,872 --> 01:20:13,517
And in this war their
invisible army is our media.

1164
01:20:14,554 --> 01:20:17,434
The day we Indians realise that,

1165
01:20:17,933 --> 01:20:22,195
people will drag the media out on
the street and beat the hell out of them.

1166
01:20:22,426 --> 01:20:26,150
Before you go pointing fingers at me,
tell me something,

1167
01:20:26,611 --> 01:20:28,992
You too were in a position
power back then, weren't you?

1168
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:32,026
In fact, you were
more powerful than me.

1169
01:20:32,141 --> 01:20:34,330
Why didn't you do anything?

1170
01:20:34,714 --> 01:20:37,901
Because you too were in the market
to be sold.

1171
01:20:38,054 --> 01:20:39,782
Where was your courage back then?

1172
01:20:39,821 --> 01:20:41,626
How dare you!

1173
01:20:41,856 --> 01:20:44,467
How dare you question
my integrity and courage?

1174
01:20:44,774 --> 01:20:46,963
I fought with the terrorists, alone!

1175
01:20:47,117 --> 01:20:49,574
They threw a bomb at me! Not you!

1176
01:20:49,690 --> 01:20:52,723
I am the one who barely escaped death.

1177
01:20:52,915 --> 01:20:54,912
I didn't get the Padma Shri for no reason.

1178
01:20:54,989 --> 01:20:56,141
No!

1179
01:20:56,333 --> 01:21:00,134
The Government gave you the
Padma Shri to buy your silence!

1180
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:03,053
It is very easy to blame the media.

1181
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:06,048
You can say whatever you want.

1182
01:21:06,355 --> 01:21:07,930
19!

1183
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:11,501
19 reporters have died in Kashmir so far.

1184
01:21:11,731 --> 01:21:14,074
Did anyone protect us?

1185
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:15,648
Did anyone?

1186
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:18,413
Who would protect a traitor?

1187
01:21:18,605 --> 01:21:19,181
Yes.

1188
01:21:19,334 --> 01:21:20,717
Who are you calling a traitor, huh?

1189
01:21:21,370 --> 01:21:22,560
Who are you calling a traitor, huh?

1190
01:21:22,637 --> 01:21:23,942
You.

1191
01:21:23,981 --> 01:21:25,286
- How dare you!
- You bastard!

1192
01:21:25,363 --> 01:21:27,360
- You...
- You're a bloody snake in the grass.

1193
01:21:27,514 --> 01:21:28,589
How dare you call me a traitor!

1194
01:21:28,704 --> 01:21:30,662
- You're a snake in the grass.
- How dare you call me a traitor!

1195
01:21:30,701 --> 01:21:31,968
How dare you call me a traitor!

1196
01:21:32,083 --> 01:21:32,890
Stop them, sir.

1197
01:21:32,966 --> 01:21:34,541
- Why aren't you stopping them?
- I'll strangle you.

1198
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:38,266
They have been holding
it back for 30 years. Let it be.

1199
01:21:38,381 --> 01:21:40,109
I'll strangle you.

1200
01:21:40,186 --> 01:21:41,683
How dare you call me a traitor!

1201
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,488
Vishnu! Control yourself.

1202
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:44,909
- Why don't you stop them?
- Stop it!

1203
01:21:45,024 --> 01:21:46,714
Don't you dare!

1204
01:22:01,421 --> 01:22:06,528
This is an Info war, an advanced war,

1205
01:22:07,334 --> 01:22:08,755
a very dangerous war.

1206
01:22:08,832 --> 01:22:11,251
It's a war of narratives.

1207
01:22:12,211 --> 01:22:15,168
You know when the foreign
press comes to Kashmir,

1208
01:22:15,245 --> 01:22:21,581
they first contact the Pakistan
sponsored separatist network.

1209
01:22:22,541 --> 01:22:26,266
They are taken to a separatist location.

1210
01:22:27,917 --> 01:22:33,408
Where people are paid 500 rupees
to tell them stories of victimhood.

1211
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:35,520
And you know who they use as their shield?

1212
01:22:35,712 --> 01:22:38,246
Women and children.

1213
01:22:38,515 --> 01:22:43,622
After that, they create
horrific images using Photoshop.

1214
01:22:44,774 --> 01:22:46,541
Clickbait headlines.

1215
01:22:47,232 --> 01:22:51,648
They make an Anti-India, Fascist India,
Oppressive India's narrative.

1216
01:22:51,725 --> 01:22:55,411
A narrative which has nothing
to do with history or politics.

1217
01:22:57,101 --> 01:22:58,790
It requires no home-work.

1218
01:23:00,749 --> 01:23:03,744
I had come here when Burhan Wani died.

1219
01:23:04,704 --> 01:23:06,048
You know where they
mourned for Burhan Wani?

1220
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:09,850
The places where the international
press used to be.

1221
01:23:10,349 --> 01:23:12,691
Camera on, mourning begins.

1222
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:15,149
Camera off, mourning stops.

1223
01:23:15,456 --> 01:23:18,490
The kids who threw stones
when the cameras rolled,

1224
01:23:18,566 --> 01:23:20,755
disappeared as soon
as the cameras switched off.

1225
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:26,707
The lie travels the world by
the time the truth decides to step out.

1226
01:23:27,552 --> 01:23:29,088
That's why

1227
01:23:29,587 --> 01:23:34,541
The world doesn't know
the true story of Kashmiri Hindus.

1228
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:39,955
Jews.

1229
01:23:40,570 --> 01:23:42,950
You know what they did?

1230
01:23:43,795 --> 01:23:48,941
They didn't let the world forget what
they went through during the holocaust.

1231
01:23:52,474 --> 01:23:55,968
Why didn't Kashmir Pandits do the same?

1232
01:23:56,506 --> 01:23:59,232
Why didn't they tell the
world what they went through?

1233
01:24:00,998 --> 01:24:03,994
No one was ready to listen.

1234
01:24:17,434 --> 01:24:19,584
Right.

1235
01:24:25,651 --> 01:24:29,146
Mr. Pushkar Nath, you have cataract.

1236
01:24:30,221 --> 01:24:32,256
We will have to operate.

1237
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:34,752
We'll change the lens as well.

1238
01:24:35,174 --> 01:24:36,941
Which lens would you prefer?

1239
01:24:37,632 --> 01:24:39,053
What do you mean?

1240
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:42,125
We offer free consultation,
but you will have to pay for the lens.

1241
01:24:42,394 --> 01:24:43,507
It will be a discounted rate, of course.

1242
01:24:43,584 --> 01:24:44,621
There's a cheap one and an expensive one--

1243
01:24:44,774 --> 01:24:46,426
I'll take the cheap one.

1244
01:24:46,733 --> 01:24:47,770
Hear me out.

1245
01:24:47,846 --> 01:24:50,381
I told you, I want the cheapest one.

1246
01:24:50,611 --> 01:24:51,494
Why?

1247
01:24:51,610 --> 01:24:58,445
I can either use my pension to educate
my grandson or to buy the expensive lens.

1248
01:25:00,058 --> 01:25:01,632
You have diabetes.

1249
01:25:01,709 --> 01:25:03,667
Glaucoma.

1250
01:25:04,243 --> 01:25:06,816
There are high chances of
blindness or partial blindness.

1251
01:25:07,392 --> 01:25:09,965
What if you lose your eyesight?

1252
01:25:11,616 --> 01:25:13,421
I'll manage.

1253
01:25:18,682 --> 01:25:20,371
Education is more important.

1254
01:25:32,621 --> 01:25:34,694
I want more rice, Mom.

1255
01:25:40,646 --> 01:25:42,758
No, you shouldn't eat
too much rice at night.

1256
01:25:42,874 --> 01:25:44,371
Your stomach will start aching.

1257
01:25:44,986 --> 01:25:46,291
- Father?
- Yes

1258
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,674
Have your dinner.

1259
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,210
I am not hungry.

1260
01:25:50,784 --> 01:25:53,741
I've noticed you are
having only one meal a day.

1261
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:56,275
I told you I don't feel
hungry in the evenings.

1262
01:26:00,806 --> 01:26:02,496
Where are you going?

1263
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:05,107
I'll sleep outside.

1264
01:26:05,222 --> 01:26:07,296
Otherwise, he will be disturbed.

1265
01:26:07,488 --> 01:26:08,717
No, I won't be disturbed.

1266
01:26:08,794 --> 01:26:10,944
I snore a lot.

1267
01:26:14,477 --> 01:26:16,742
There are scorpions outside.

1268
01:26:17,664 --> 01:26:20,083
Scorpions are scared of your grandpa.

1269
01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:23,155
If I see one then
I'll hit it with my slipper like this.

1270
01:26:24,307 --> 01:26:28,493
Grandpa, you can't even
see clearly during the day.

1271
01:26:28,570 --> 01:26:32,755
How will you spot the
scorpions at night?

1272
01:26:33,523 --> 01:26:39,322
I'll see better than
you once I have the operation.

1273
01:26:39,936 --> 01:26:43,891
Then soon we'll go back to Kashmir.

1274
01:26:44,083 --> 01:26:45,197
All of us.

1275
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:46,272
Me too.

1276
01:26:46,349 --> 01:26:47,770
Yes, you too.

1277
01:26:48,768 --> 01:26:52,454
I will travel the whole world,

1278
01:26:52,646 --> 01:26:55,795
But nothing will be as special to me
as you, my dear home.

1279
01:26:56,102 --> 01:27:02,707
My dear home, how I wish to
never step out of your doors.

1280
01:27:02,822 --> 01:27:06,662
I will travel a thousand miles,

1281
01:27:06,701 --> 01:27:11,155
But nothing will be as special to me
as you, my dear home.

1282
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:16,301
We ran away to save our lives.

1283
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:21,331
What constellation dawned on us
that we had to leave our home.

1284
01:27:21,523 --> 01:27:24,941
My dear home,
I will sacrifice everything for you.

1285
01:27:25,056 --> 01:27:28,397
How I wish to never
step out of your doors.

1286
01:27:28,704 --> 01:27:32,160
I will travel a thousand miles,

1287
01:27:32,467 --> 01:27:36,768
Nothing is as special to me as you.

1288
01:27:36,883 --> 01:27:41,376
My dear home,
I will sacrifice everything for you.

1289
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:44,794
How I wish to never
step out of your doors.

1290
01:27:45,062 --> 01:27:49,171
I will travel a thousand miles,

1291
01:27:49,594 --> 01:27:54,010
Nothing is as special to me as you.

1292
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:58,272
I will travel a thousand miles,

1293
01:27:58,733 --> 01:28:03,686
Nothing is as special to me as you.

1294
01:28:03,917 --> 01:28:07,872
My dear home,
I will sacrifice everything for you.

1295
01:28:08,026 --> 01:28:11,981
How I wish to never
step out of your doors.

1296
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:16,435
I will travel a thousand miles,

1297
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:21,427
Nothing is as special to me as you.

1298
01:28:21,542 --> 01:28:25,920
Nothing is as special to me as you.

1299
01:28:28,262 --> 01:28:31,526
Mother! Mother!

1300
01:28:32,026 --> 01:28:35,136
Mother! Mother!

1301
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:39,398
Mother! Mother!

1302
01:28:42,701 --> 01:28:44,928
Mother! Mother!

1303
01:29:27,936 --> 01:29:31,046
Did any of you meet him after that?

1304
01:29:39,533 --> 01:29:45,024
It's quite late. I'm tired.

1305
01:29:45,869 --> 01:29:47,635
I'm going to bed.

1306
01:29:48,941 --> 01:29:49,862
Goodnight.

1307
01:29:49,901 --> 01:29:51,168
See you tomorrow.

1308
01:29:51,322 --> 01:29:53,088
I think I've had too much too.

1309
01:29:54,086 --> 01:29:55,238
We'll call it a day.

1310
01:29:55,315 --> 01:29:56,621
Goodnight.

1311
01:30:02,150 --> 01:30:03,533
Goodnight, Laxmi.

1312
01:30:24,077 --> 01:30:25,805
Goodnight.

1313
01:30:32,563 --> 01:30:34,368
You never met him again as well?

1314
01:30:37,094 --> 01:30:38,554
No.

1315
01:30:48,461 --> 01:30:52,723
I did, once... in Jammu.

1316
01:30:53,376 --> 01:30:56,563
The Chief Minister
resigned on 18th January.

1317
01:30:56,794 --> 01:31:00,134
The new Governor joined
office on 20th January.

1318
01:31:00,595 --> 01:31:04,550
There was no government
in Kashmir for two days.

1319
01:31:06,125 --> 01:31:11,693
I was made the new
Advisor to the Governor.

1320
01:31:13,190 --> 01:31:15,533
Whether anyone believes it or not...

1321
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:22,675
My priority was to bring
Kashmiri Pandits back to Kashmir.

1322
01:31:23,597 --> 01:31:29,510
No one from the Centre
ever visited the Jammu Camps.

1323
01:31:30,048 --> 01:31:36,077
After a lot of requests,
Home Minister agreed for a visit.

1324
01:31:37,114 --> 01:31:38,381
Move aside.

1325
01:31:38,496 --> 01:31:40,262
Go and wait at where I came from.

1326
01:31:41,798 --> 01:31:43,027
Good day, sir.

1327
01:31:52,166 --> 01:31:54,202
The situation is very bad.

1328
01:31:54,624 --> 01:31:56,621
People are dying from
scorpion and snake bites.

1329
01:31:56,736 --> 01:32:00,230
People are dying from diabetes,
sunstroke and hyper-tension.

1330
01:32:00,461 --> 01:32:02,573
Maximum people suffer from PTSD.

1331
01:32:03,072 --> 01:32:09,101
Miscarriages,
early menopause, abnormal menstrual cycle.

1332
01:32:09,216 --> 01:32:12,480
All in all,
5,000-6,000 people have died so far.

1333
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:16,128
25-26 people live in a single tent, sir.

1334
01:32:16,973 --> 01:32:18,701
No one has money for medical treatment.

1335
01:32:19,008 --> 01:32:20,083
How will they go on like this?

1336
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:22,003
And for how long, sir?

1337
01:32:22,195 --> 01:32:27,686
It looks like they
have been left here to die.

1338
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,030
It's natural.

1339
01:32:29,683 --> 01:32:33,216
It's so hot out here, anyone will die.

1340
01:32:33,485 --> 01:32:38,630
This is the first time in 100 generations they
have stepped outside of Kashmir's cold climate.

1341
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:40,973
Not stepped out, sir.

1342
01:32:41,242 --> 01:32:43,200
They were thrown out.

1343
01:32:45,082 --> 01:32:49,075
Now you can come one by one and
submit your requests to the Home Minister.

1344
01:32:51,802 --> 01:32:55,910
Sir, government gives 2 lakh rupees
to each terrorist for surrendering.

1345
01:32:56,794 --> 01:33:00,941
They in turn use that money to buy Kalashnikovs
at cheap rates to further kill innocent people

1346
01:33:01,171 --> 01:33:04,896
Then they again surrender and
treat themselves with two lakhs.

1347
01:33:05,126 --> 01:33:06,432
What does the government give us?

1348
01:33:06,547 --> 01:33:08,774
600 rupees. Is that even just?

1349
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,232
Will our families survive
in mere 600 rupees. What is this?

1350
01:33:11,462 --> 01:33:14,035
We are scattered people.
Look at our condition in camps.

1351
01:33:14,266 --> 01:33:16,032
We live amidst snakes,
scorpions, stones.

1352
01:33:16,224 --> 01:33:19,296
In the cruel heat,
we languish in these tents.

1353
01:33:19,373 --> 01:33:21,946
We don't have any food, any education...

1354
01:33:22,061 --> 01:33:24,595
In Maharashtra Balasaheb
has allotted special quota...

1355
01:33:24,672 --> 01:33:27,168
For our kids in all the
engineering colleges.

1356
01:33:27,245 --> 01:33:29,741
Why can't the Central Government
do this all across India?

1357
01:33:29,856 --> 01:33:30,662
Enough.

1358
01:33:30,701 --> 01:33:32,390
Any other requests?

1359
01:33:40,723 --> 01:33:43,181
I am used to applying
Boroline.

1360
01:33:43,488 --> 01:33:45,101
They don't have any in this camp.

1361
01:33:45,216 --> 01:33:46,867
Get him some immediately.

1362
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:47,827
Okay, sir.

1363
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:48,941
One more thing.

1364
01:33:49,056 --> 01:33:54,432
I have sent more than 100 letters to your
Office requesting removal of Article 370

1365
01:33:54,662 --> 01:33:57,542
but your office didn't
reply to a single letter of mine.

1366
01:33:57,581 --> 01:34:00,115
Look that is a different issue.

1367
01:34:00,576 --> 01:34:02,726
I am here to help you.

1368
01:34:02,803 --> 01:34:03,917
This is the only help I want from you.

1369
01:34:04,070 --> 01:34:07,296
Remove Article 370 and
rehabilitate Kashmiri Pandits.

1370
01:34:07,411 --> 01:34:08,678
Remove Article 370!

1371
01:34:08,755 --> 01:34:10,176
Remove Article 370!

1372
01:34:10,253 --> 01:34:11,674
Remove Article 370!

1373
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:13,478
Remove Article 370!

1374
01:34:13,555 --> 01:34:15,283
Remove Article 370!

1375
01:34:15,437 --> 01:34:17,395
Remove Article 370!

1376
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:19,315
Pushkar?

1377
01:34:19,584 --> 01:34:20,544
Yes?

1378
01:34:20,621 --> 01:34:22,656
Pushkar, it's me, Brahma.

1379
01:34:23,923 --> 01:34:27,648
Remove Article 370 and
rehabilitate Kashmiri Hindus.

1380
01:34:27,725 --> 01:34:31,565
Remove Article 370 and
rehabilitate Kashmiri Hindus.

1381
01:34:31,987 --> 01:34:33,370
Remove Article 370!

1382
01:34:33,446 --> 01:34:35,213
Remove Article 370!

1383
01:34:35,290 --> 01:34:38,400
Remove Article 370 and
rehabilitate Kashmiri Hindus.

1384
01:34:38,554 --> 01:34:41,933
Remove Article 370 and
rehabilitate Kashmiri Hindus.

1385
01:34:57,062 --> 01:34:58,790
I have made all the arrangements.

1386
01:34:58,867 --> 01:35:02,170
You will get a government
job at Nadimarg's Council Office.

1387
01:35:02,822 --> 01:35:06,701
There are a lot of Kashmiri
Hindu families residing there.

1388
01:35:06,931 --> 01:35:08,237
It is absolutely safe.

1389
01:35:08,851 --> 01:35:11,501
I have had a word with
the Council President.

1390
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:13,229
You will be staying in his house.

1391
01:35:13,344 --> 01:35:15,686
You know how stubborn Father is.

1392
01:35:16,570 --> 01:35:18,720
He will only go back
to his own house in Kashmir.

1393
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:23,750
When you have to climb Mt. Everest,
you have to take one step at a time.

1394
01:35:25,517 --> 01:35:26,976
I'll try to get him to agree with it.

1395
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:30,125
No, you will have to convince him.

1396
01:35:31,507 --> 01:35:32,621
You have two kids.

1397
01:35:33,850 --> 01:35:36,653
You cannot ruin their future.
Right?

1398
01:35:37,075 --> 01:35:40,262
You want to go back to Kashmir, right?

1399
01:35:40,493 --> 01:35:42,029
Right, Shiva?

1400
01:35:54,701 --> 01:35:56,582
Hurry! Come on, fast.

1401
01:35:57,197 --> 01:35:59,232
What do you mean
the Prime Minister is busy?

1402
01:35:59,309 --> 01:36:00,922
No, I don't understand.

1403
01:36:00,998 --> 01:36:04,032
I want his direct number.

1404
01:36:04,954 --> 01:36:06,413
Okay.

1405
01:36:07,027 --> 01:36:08,794
I'll call again tomorrow.

1406
01:36:09,754 --> 01:36:11,942
I told the man at the
Prime Minister's office.

1407
01:36:12,173 --> 01:36:14,822
If he doesn't call me tomorrow, I
will go to Delhi myself and talk to him.

1408
01:36:14,861 --> 01:36:17,664
Hey, you forgot to touch grandpa's feet.

1409
01:36:21,542 --> 01:36:24,922
We worship Goddess Saraswati,
Goddess of Knowledge, Sharda.

1410
01:36:25,306 --> 01:36:27,149
Your mother's also named Sharda.

1411
01:36:27,226 --> 01:36:28,762
You should worship her.

1412
01:36:28,915 --> 01:36:31,296
- When you will have no one
- Tell me as well.

1413
01:36:31,373 --> 01:36:33,062
Yes, son.
When you will have no one with you

1414
01:36:33,101 --> 01:36:35,021
And the darkness will surround you

1415
01:36:35,136 --> 01:36:36,902
She is the one who will guide you.

1416
01:36:37,056 --> 01:36:38,208
Okay?

1417
01:36:38,784 --> 01:36:41,126
Krishna, you should take
your grandfather's blessings too.

1418
01:36:42,202 --> 01:36:44,736
Oh, my darling child!

1419
01:36:48,461 --> 01:36:49,805
I want to play too.

1420
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:52,262
Shiva, why have you jumped in?

1421
01:36:52,301 --> 01:36:57,331
Come out, you dirty child.
You will spoil all your clothes.

1422
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:01,594
Why did you jump?

1423
01:37:10,426 --> 01:37:11,424
Greetings, sir.

1424
01:37:11,501 --> 01:37:12,768
Greetings.

1425
01:37:13,037 --> 01:37:16,416
School was off so I thought
I'd go and inspect the surroundings.

1426
01:37:16,531 --> 01:37:18,182
With God's grace everything is
running smoothly.

1427
01:37:18,221 --> 01:37:19,373
Hello.

1428
01:37:19,488 --> 01:37:20,371
Hello.

1429
01:37:20,486 --> 01:37:21,677
Shiva.

1430
01:37:21,907 --> 01:37:23,366
Maulvi sir, I wanted to discuss
something important with you.

1431
01:37:23,482 --> 01:37:24,902
I am at your service.

1432
01:37:24,941 --> 01:37:27,053
Our kids need to learn science.

1433
01:37:27,130 --> 01:37:29,280
Why don't they teach
science in our school?

1434
01:37:29,549 --> 01:37:31,469
Let's not talk about the school.

1435
01:37:31,546 --> 01:37:33,504
Let's talk about you instead.

1436
01:37:33,811 --> 01:37:35,846
Nowadays, the situation is bad.

1437
01:37:36,461 --> 01:37:38,381
You should marry me.

1438
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:41,952
Both you and your children
will get protection.

1439
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:52,397
Hello.
This is Vishnu Ram

1440
01:37:52,589 --> 01:37:56,851
Our special guest for
tonight is Farooq Malik Bitta.

1441
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,923
This is a very bad man.

1442
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,728
People have a lot to say about you.

1443
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:04,570
After all who is Farooq Malik Bitta?

1444
01:38:04,954 --> 01:38:06,221
Freedom fighter.

1445
01:38:07,565 --> 01:38:11,597
You have been accused of
killing many Kashmiri Pandits.

1446
01:38:12,672 --> 01:38:13,594
Yes.

1447
01:38:13,670 --> 01:38:15,437
How many have you killed?

1448
01:38:17,165 --> 01:38:19,853
I don't remember. 20, maybe 25.

1449
01:38:20,237 --> 01:38:23,002
Who was the first person you murdered?

1450
01:38:24,922 --> 01:38:26,342
Satish.

1451
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,994
Satish who?

1452
01:38:28,262 --> 01:38:30,029
Satish Kumar Tickoo.

1453
01:38:30,758 --> 01:38:32,102
Who was he?

1454
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:33,946
A Pandit boy.

1455
01:38:34,176 --> 01:38:36,288
So, you killed him
because he was a Pandit?

1456
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:38,246
He worked for the RSS.

1457
01:38:38,822 --> 01:38:41,741
So, it is a crime to work for the RSS?

1458
01:38:42,432 --> 01:38:43,507
Yes.

1459
01:38:43,661 --> 01:38:46,195
The people you killed included

1460
01:38:46,272 --> 01:38:49,997
your neighbours, friends and teachers.

1461
01:38:50,765 --> 01:38:51,994
What about the Air Force killings?

1462
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:54,528
Two innocent women died in that incident.

1463
01:38:55,373 --> 01:38:57,024
We are talking about a war here.

1464
01:38:57,638 --> 01:38:59,443
And everything's fair
when it comes to war.

1465
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:03,053
He has managed to reach Delhi.

1466
01:39:04,090 --> 01:39:08,314
He will soon make his way
to the Prime Minister as well.

1467
01:39:08,544 --> 01:39:12,230
What if they'd asked
you to kill your brother?

1468
01:39:12,922 --> 01:39:14,381
I would have killed him.

1469
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:17,453
And if they'd asked
you to kill your mother?

1470
01:39:17,530 --> 01:39:18,643
You would have killed her as well?

1471
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,986
I would have.

1472
01:39:23,366 --> 01:39:24,480
Repeat after me, kids.

1473
01:39:24,557 --> 01:39:27,629
- This is Kashmir.
- This is Kashmir.

1474
01:39:27,706 --> 01:39:31,085
- We are Kashmiris.
- We are Kashmiris.

1475
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,811
Kashmir's neighbouring countries are...

1476
01:39:33,926 --> 01:39:35,770
Afghanistan.

1477
01:39:35,846 --> 01:39:38,342
China and Pakistan.

1478
01:39:38,381 --> 01:39:40,685
China and Pakistan.

1479
01:39:40,762 --> 01:39:41,645
And?

1480
01:39:41,722 --> 01:39:43,565
India!

1481
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:47,021
The council President will
be paying us a visit today.

1482
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:53,203
What will you say if he asks
you what you want in this village?

1483
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:54,931
Masjid!

1484
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:56,045
What will you say?

1485
01:39:56,122 --> 01:39:57,389
Masjid!

1486
01:39:57,466 --> 01:39:58,848
Say it.

1487
01:39:59,002 --> 01:40:00,230
What do we want?

1488
01:40:00,307 --> 01:40:01,882
Masjid!

1489
01:40:02,227 --> 01:40:03,456
What do we want?

1490
01:40:03,533 --> 01:40:05,491
- Masjid!
- What do we want?

1491
01:40:05,606 --> 01:40:06,989
Masjid!

1492
01:40:18,701 --> 01:40:24,000
Your mom told me you didn't
eat your food today! Why?

1493
01:40:24,269 --> 01:40:25,920
I don't want to go to school.

1494
01:40:26,381 --> 01:40:28,109
Why don't you want to go to school?

1495
01:40:28,685 --> 01:40:30,029
I'm scared.

1496
01:40:30,566 --> 01:40:32,870
What is my boy scared of?

1497
01:40:33,792 --> 01:40:36,941
Of what's written on
the wall of our school.

1498
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:39,130
What's written on the wall of your school?

1499
01:40:39,206 --> 01:40:41,510
Raliv, Galiv, Chaliv.

1500
01:40:45,197 --> 01:40:48,768
What do you think Raliv,
Galiv, Chaliv means?

1501
01:40:49,152 --> 01:40:53,261
Either convert to Islam,
or die or flee.

1502
01:40:56,486 --> 01:40:57,907
You are wrong.

1503
01:40:58,406 --> 01:41:01,248
Raliv, Galiv, Chaliv means:

1504
01:41:01,517 --> 01:41:07,123
Oh fear!
Either become my strength.

1505
01:41:07,661 --> 01:41:11,462
Or die. Or flee.

1506
01:41:11,501 --> 01:41:12,730
What does it mean?

1507
01:41:12,845 --> 01:41:14,189
Oh fear!

1508
01:41:14,496 --> 01:41:18,720
Either become my strength.
Or die. Or flee.

1509
01:41:18,835 --> 01:41:19,795
Repeat after me.

1510
01:41:19,910 --> 01:41:22,022
Convert, die or leave.

1511
01:41:22,061 --> 01:41:23,789
Convert, die or leave.

1512
01:41:23,981 --> 01:41:25,709
Convert, die or leave.

1513
01:41:25,901 --> 01:41:27,782
Convert, die or leave.

1514
01:41:27,821 --> 01:41:29,549
Convert, die or leave.

1515
01:41:29,626 --> 01:41:31,162
Convert, die or leave.

1516
01:41:31,315 --> 01:41:33,005
Convert, die or leave.

1517
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:34,810
Convert, die or leave.

1518
01:41:34,925 --> 01:41:36,576
Convert, die or leave.

1519
01:41:36,653 --> 01:41:38,342
Convert, die or leave.

1520
01:41:38,381 --> 01:41:40,186
Convert, die or leave!

1521
01:41:40,301 --> 01:41:41,990
Convert, die or leave!

1522
01:41:42,106 --> 01:41:43,795
Convert, die or leave!

1523
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:46,061
Convert, die or leave!

1524
01:41:46,176 --> 01:41:48,288
Convert, die or leave!

1525
01:41:48,403 --> 01:41:50,592
Convert, die or leave!

1526
01:41:50,669 --> 01:41:52,474
Convert, die or leave!

1527
01:41:52,550 --> 01:41:54,509
Convert, die or leave!

1528
01:41:54,586 --> 01:41:56,275
Convert, die or leave!

1529
01:41:56,467 --> 01:41:58,502
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

1530
01:41:58,541 --> 01:42:01,037
What they do can't be called
Kashmiriyat.

1531
01:42:01,382 --> 01:42:03,725
Kashmiriyat is what our
children are doing.

1532
01:42:03,955 --> 01:42:05,222
Freedom from hatred.

1533
01:42:05,261 --> 01:42:07,450
Freedom is no longer just a slogan.

1534
01:42:07,757 --> 01:42:08,717
It's a mantra.

1535
01:42:08,832 --> 01:42:10,714
- We want Freedom from federalism!
- Freedom!

1536
01:42:10,790 --> 01:42:12,634
- We want Freedom from Hindu ideologies!
- Freedom!

1537
01:42:12,749 --> 01:42:16,128
They want Freedom from India.

1538
01:42:16,435 --> 01:42:18,394
Freedom is a song of terrorism.

1539
01:42:18,509 --> 01:42:19,814
Afzal, we apologise!

1540
01:42:19,891 --> 01:42:22,080
Just like chanting Om
creates vibrations inside you,

1541
01:42:22,771 --> 01:42:25,843
The word 'Freedom' awakens
the revolutionary inside you.

1542
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,149
Freedom is our right!

1543
01:42:27,264 --> 01:42:31,066
They kept chanting "Freedom"
when they were shooting at our children.

1544
01:42:31,296 --> 01:42:32,525
Do anything you want...

1545
01:42:32,602 --> 01:42:34,982
But never support the
ones who shout slogans of Freedom.

1546
01:42:35,021 --> 01:42:37,171
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

1547
01:42:37,248 --> 01:42:38,784
Freedom is a symbol.

1548
01:42:39,168 --> 01:42:41,050
It's an anthem of Free Kashmir...

1549
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:43,238
Exactly like the Jana
Gana Mana of India.

1550
01:42:43,315 --> 01:42:46,003
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

1551
01:42:54,528 --> 01:42:57,754
It's happening.

1552
01:42:58,714 --> 01:43:02,362
You might not see it,
but it's happening.

1553
01:43:02,746 --> 01:43:09,235
The Prime Minister will write to me
when they remove Article 370.

1554
01:43:09,466 --> 01:43:11,194
He'll write:

1555
01:43:11,347 --> 01:43:18,989
"Mr. Pushkar Nath Pandit,
grandfather of Mr. Krishna Pandit."

1556
01:43:19,142 --> 01:43:24,134
"We have noted all your 6000 letters."

1557
01:43:24,634 --> 01:43:29,702
"We declare that you
are no longer a migrant."

1558
01:43:30,355 --> 01:43:33,158
"You can go back to Kashmir."

1559
01:43:38,189 --> 01:43:40,301
Dreams don't just come true.

1560
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:45,139
You have to chase them.

1561
01:43:46,522 --> 01:43:49,862
We won't fly there.

1562
01:43:50,285 --> 01:43:51,936
We'll drive there.

1563
01:43:52,934 --> 01:43:59,616
I'll show you the Martand Temple,
Kheer Bhavani...

1564
01:44:00,154 --> 01:44:04,416
Tulamula,
Habba Kadal, Rainawari, Shankaracharya...

1565
01:44:05,453 --> 01:44:08,794
Karan Nagar.
My maternal home was at 84, Karan Nagar.

1566
01:44:09,869 --> 01:44:14,669
Listen, I want you to fulfil my last wish.

1567
01:44:14,784 --> 01:44:17,818
Grandpa.
Please Grandpa.

1568
01:44:17,933 --> 01:44:24,806
I want you to scatter my ashes
in my ancestral home in Kashmir.

1569
01:44:27,034 --> 01:44:32,256
I had 4 friends. You will find
their numbers in my phone.

1570
01:44:40,627 --> 01:44:43,507
Take them along with you.

1571
01:44:48,499 --> 01:44:55,795
The window of my room rots
from all the heavy snowing.

1572
01:44:55,834 --> 01:44:57,946
You should get it repaired.

1573
01:45:00,365 --> 01:45:02,515
My scooter,

1574
01:45:05,587 --> 01:45:07,200
Get that painted.

1575
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:10,733
Its engine is new but get it painted.

1576
01:45:11,616 --> 01:45:15,802
Only 8,000 kilometers old.

1577
01:45:16,109 --> 01:45:22,829
And... oh yes, your school certificates.

1578
01:45:24,173 --> 01:45:26,054
Don't doubt.

1579
01:45:27,168 --> 01:45:29,894
Don't doubt. All will be fine.

1580
01:45:30,278 --> 01:45:37,114
Oh snow, fall please.
Oh brother, come to greet us

1581
01:45:38,496 --> 01:45:44,794
Impossible... impossible takes time...

1582
01:45:46,061 --> 01:45:52,666
But you must...
you must always keep hope.

1583
01:45:53,318 --> 01:46:03,226
The nightingale sings praises
of the Indian flora.

1584
01:46:27,187 --> 01:46:30,067
We will see.

1585
01:46:31,949 --> 01:46:34,022
We will see.

1586
01:46:34,138 --> 01:46:38,554
It is inevitable that we will see.

1587
01:46:38,669 --> 01:46:42,010
We will see.

1588
01:46:43,162 --> 01:46:47,386
That day that has been promised.

1589
01:46:47,501 --> 01:46:49,613
We will see.

1590
01:46:49,766 --> 01:46:54,067
What is written in the book of destiny.

1591
01:46:54,144 --> 01:46:56,218
We will see.

1592
01:46:56,294 --> 01:47:00,634
It is inevitable that we will see.

1593
01:47:00,749 --> 01:47:03,936
We will see.

1594
01:47:05,126 --> 01:47:11,462
And when the mountains of
oppression and cruelty.

1595
01:47:11,539 --> 01:47:16,723
Will blow away like carded wool.

1596
01:47:18,374 --> 01:47:24,058
Beneath our enslaved feet

1597
01:47:24,941 --> 01:47:29,741
The ground will echo like a thumping heartbeat.

1598
01:47:29,818 --> 01:47:31,123
Wonderful.

1599
01:47:31,238 --> 01:47:35,155
And the sky over the heads of our rulers,

1600
01:47:35,194 --> 01:47:39,533
Will echo with the sound of thunder.

1601
01:47:39,610 --> 01:47:42,029
We will see.

1602
01:47:42,144 --> 01:47:43,795
Come join us Krishna.

1603
01:47:43,834 --> 01:47:46,061
We will see.

1604
01:47:46,330 --> 01:47:50,669
It is inevitable that we will see.

1605
01:47:50,784 --> 01:47:54,240
We will see.

1606
01:47:59,194 --> 01:48:01,344
What's wrong?
Krishna, any problem?

1607
01:48:02,189 --> 01:48:04,570
My grandfather passed away last night.

1608
01:48:05,530 --> 01:48:07,488
I have to go to Kashmir with his ashes.

1609
01:48:08,333 --> 01:48:10,214
- So sorry.
- So sorry, Krishna.

1610
01:48:10,291 --> 01:48:12,557
Sorry for your loss, Krishna.

1611
01:48:13,555 --> 01:48:15,206
I'm very sorry, Krishna.

1612
01:48:16,358 --> 01:48:19,162
I never got a chance to meet him.

1613
01:48:19,546 --> 01:48:21,542
But I am sure he was a good man.

1614
01:48:22,042 --> 01:48:24,000
He had dementia, ma'am.

1615
01:48:27,610 --> 01:48:31,258
All his life he kept fighting
for the removal of Article 370.

1616
01:48:32,026 --> 01:48:36,403
And he didn't even realise
when it was abrogated.

1617
01:48:37,747 --> 01:48:39,014
What about your speech?

1618
01:48:39,091 --> 01:48:40,896
But his grandfather just died.

1619
01:48:41,434 --> 01:48:44,160
Professor, I don't mean to sound rude but all
the preparations have been made for his speech.

1620
01:48:44,237 --> 01:48:47,002
And all the media has been informed.

1621
01:48:47,078 --> 01:48:48,422
What about that?

1622
01:48:49,843 --> 01:48:51,840
I'll be back by Saturday.

1623
01:48:58,291 --> 01:48:59,674
Come.

1624
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:06,586
Krishna, we are fighting this election
based on the Kashmir issue.

1625
01:49:06,662 --> 01:49:08,659
So, it is a tough competition.

1626
01:49:09,274 --> 01:49:11,347
But we will not lose.

1627
01:49:13,766 --> 01:49:18,106
We have spent all our lives
keeping the Kashmir issue alive.

1628
01:49:20,141 --> 01:49:22,099
We cannot lose now.

1629
01:49:23,174 --> 01:49:27,475
In fact, this is the time
to demonstrate something.

1630
01:49:28,858 --> 01:49:30,278
Like what?

1631
01:49:33,197 --> 01:49:37,459
Go to Kashmir and record on your phone...

1632
01:49:38,227 --> 01:49:44,026
How Kashmir is under
attack by the state of India.

1633
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:48,365
For 18 months there has
been no internet in Kashmir.

1634
01:49:48,442 --> 01:49:50,285
Record all this... everything.

1635
01:49:51,206 --> 01:49:53,741
Ma'am, people already know everything.

1636
01:49:53,818 --> 01:49:54,970
No, Krishna.

1637
01:49:55,085 --> 01:49:59,194
People only look at the newspaper,
they don't read it.

1638
01:50:00,115 --> 01:50:02,573
And they only hear the television news,
they don't understand it.

1639
01:50:02,803 --> 01:50:07,680
When people will see Kashmir's tragedy
through your eyes, they will believe it.

1640
01:50:07,757 --> 01:50:09,331
Ma'am, this is just
a small college election.

1641
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:10,522
No, Krishna!

1642
01:50:10,637 --> 01:50:14,208
This is an election of
our existence and our narrative!

1643
01:50:15,590 --> 01:50:18,816
And we'll never allow Kashmir
to be an integral part of this country.

1644
01:50:18,893 --> 01:50:21,235
Even if we have to set a fire for it!

1645
01:50:21,274 --> 01:50:23,501
This is the time for justice, Krishna!

1646
01:50:23,616 --> 01:50:24,883
Hang on, ma'am. Hang on.

1647
01:50:24,998 --> 01:50:26,458
Hang on, please.

1648
01:50:27,341 --> 01:50:31,219
Actually, I am quite confused.

1649
01:50:32,678 --> 01:50:34,906
I don't know what is
right and what is wrong.

1650
01:50:35,251 --> 01:50:37,594
I don't know whether I should
fulfil my grandfather's dream...

1651
01:50:37,709 --> 01:50:39,821
Or fight for Kashmir along with you.

1652
01:50:40,435 --> 01:50:43,469
I don't know who is the
persecutor and who is the victim.

1653
01:50:44,045 --> 01:50:45,581
I don't know what justice is, ma'am.

1654
01:50:45,696 --> 01:50:48,038
- I don't know anything.
- I... I am sorry.

1655
01:50:48,307 --> 01:50:50,074
I am sorry, just sit.

1656
01:50:51,994 --> 01:50:55,450
Look, every system has a hierarchy.

1657
01:50:57,101 --> 01:51:01,402
Like in the college we
have Vice-chancellor, Dean...

1658
01:51:01,517 --> 01:51:05,126
Professors,
Assistant Professors, Clerical Staff...

1659
01:51:05,702 --> 01:51:08,659
Similarly, there is a
hierarchy in oppression as well.

1660
01:51:08,774 --> 01:51:12,000
Everyone in this world
has faced some kind of oppression.

1661
01:51:12,346 --> 01:51:16,646
Some have a voice and have followers.

1662
01:51:17,914 --> 01:51:21,024
The ones who don't
have a voice have support.

1663
01:51:21,677 --> 01:51:24,058
Those who don't have support, have money.

1664
01:51:25,210 --> 01:51:27,014
Some have the Government supporting them.

1665
01:51:27,398 --> 01:51:30,394
Like the current government
is supporting the Pandits.

1666
01:51:30,893 --> 01:51:34,349
But there are some who don't
have any of these things.

1667
01:51:34,464 --> 01:51:37,037
They are just a number.

1668
01:51:38,765 --> 01:51:40,685
Like the Kashmiri Youth.

1669
01:51:41,914 --> 01:51:43,834
Hear their voice.

1670
01:51:44,602 --> 01:51:46,406
Be their voice.

1671
01:51:47,789 --> 01:51:50,554
This isn't just justice, Krishna.

1672
01:51:51,053 --> 01:51:53,434
This is real humanism.

1673
01:52:00,307 --> 01:52:03,610
In fact, I'll share a contact with you.

1674
01:52:03,763 --> 01:52:08,333
It is difficult to reach him,
but you can.

1675
01:52:08,947 --> 01:52:14,285
Meet him once and you'll have
the support of the entire ecosystem.

1676
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:21,542
Ma'am, I had no idea that you
had such deep contacts in Kashmir.

1677
01:52:22,502 --> 01:52:25,306
They might run the Government, Krishna.

1678
01:52:27,187 --> 01:52:28,800
But we run system.

1679
01:53:08,198 --> 01:53:09,734
Wait, let me open it.

1680
01:53:36,461 --> 01:53:38,074
Look at that!

1681
01:54:41,549 --> 01:54:46,234
Hail Lord Shiva!

1682
01:54:46,618 --> 01:54:51,187
Hail Lord Shiva!

1683
01:54:52,301 --> 01:54:54,874
I am sorry for everything, my friend.

1684
01:54:55,450 --> 01:54:57,446
We have failed you.

1685
01:55:00,288 --> 01:55:02,246
What do I say?

1686
01:55:03,283 --> 01:55:09,005
Hey Kashmiri Pandit,
look, you have finally come back home.

1687
01:55:09,235 --> 01:55:14,342
I told you,
you will make it back home one day.

1688
01:55:46,675 --> 01:55:48,634
Come.

1689
01:55:54,202 --> 01:55:58,003
You want to know about Kashmir,
make a video.

1690
01:56:05,376 --> 01:56:11,674
Do you know which animal all
scavengers love to feast on together?

1691
01:56:13,939 --> 01:56:15,744
This place... Our Kashmir.

1692
01:56:15,859 --> 01:56:17,702
Everyone wants a piece of it.

1693
01:56:18,970 --> 01:56:21,542
What's the difference between me and you?

1694
01:56:23,194 --> 01:56:24,115
There isn't any.

1695
01:56:24,154 --> 01:56:25,075
There is.

1696
01:56:25,114 --> 01:56:26,534
There is a vast difference.

1697
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:28,915
Of an atom Bomb.
You have one.

1698
01:56:28,954 --> 01:56:30,144
Your media.

1699
01:56:30,490 --> 01:56:32,794
Your media has managed
to brainwash everyone

1700
01:56:32,947 --> 01:56:35,405
that we are terrorists. We are rapists.

1701
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:37,363
Do I look like a terrorist to you?

1702
01:56:37,824 --> 01:56:39,744
Do I look like a rapist to you?

1703
01:56:40,282 --> 01:56:42,086
Look into his innocent eyes.

1704
01:56:42,278 --> 01:56:44,582
Does he look like a terrorist to you?

1705
01:56:51,226 --> 01:56:54,758
You have internet, we don't.

1706
01:56:54,989 --> 01:56:58,675
You have 4G network, we don't.

1707
01:56:58,906 --> 01:57:00,902
What is our fault?

1708
01:57:01,210 --> 01:57:03,782
They say that we have killed Pandits.

1709
01:57:04,589 --> 01:57:05,702
Utter nonsense.

1710
01:57:05,894 --> 01:57:06,778
A lie.

1711
01:57:06,854 --> 01:57:08,467
Our neighbour was a Pandit.

1712
01:57:08,582 --> 01:57:10,502
His son was my friend.

1713
01:57:10,656 --> 01:57:12,768
I have lost my friend.

1714
01:57:13,229 --> 01:57:16,570
You know my father helped
them when they were leaving.

1715
01:57:16,646 --> 01:57:18,528
But what did he get in exchange?

1716
01:57:20,986 --> 01:57:22,982
The army killed my father.

1717
01:57:24,058 --> 01:57:25,325
But I hold no grudges.

1718
01:57:25,402 --> 01:57:26,822
I have no regrets.

1719
01:57:27,206 --> 01:57:30,317
Because I still miss my friend.

1720
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:32,736
Shiva.

1721
01:57:32,966 --> 01:57:34,464
His name was Shiva Pandit.

1722
01:57:38,650 --> 01:57:40,262
And what's your name?

1723
01:57:40,877 --> 01:57:42,182
Abdul.

1724
01:58:07,834 --> 01:58:10,406
Has the future President of ANU arrived?

1725
01:58:10,714 --> 01:58:12,288
Yes, sir.

1726
01:58:17,318 --> 01:58:18,970
Who lives here?

1727
01:58:19,238 --> 01:58:21,158
And why am I here?

1728
01:58:25,498 --> 01:58:27,533
How do you do, Mr. President?

1729
01:58:27,763 --> 01:58:32,026
Professor Radhika Menon mentioned
that your name is Krishna?

1730
01:58:32,947 --> 01:58:34,675
But you look like Arjun.

1731
01:58:41,587 --> 01:58:43,546
Say hello to Krishna.

1732
01:58:44,083 --> 01:58:45,466
Say hello to Krishna.

1733
01:58:45,542 --> 01:58:47,194
Hello Krishna.

1734
01:58:48,538 --> 01:58:50,918
Go to your mother

1735
01:58:55,296 --> 01:58:56,755
Don't worry.

1736
01:58:56,794 --> 01:58:59,366
You are safe here.

1737
01:59:00,134 --> 01:59:04,666
Whatever you have heard
or read about me is a lie.

1738
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:13,229
In reality,
this is a conspiracy of the RAW.

1739
01:59:16,339 --> 01:59:19,373
Ours was a non-violent movement,
just like Gandhi's.

1740
01:59:29,318 --> 01:59:31,238
Convert, die or leave.

1741
01:59:31,930 --> 01:59:33,581
You shouted these slogans.

1742
01:59:34,502 --> 01:59:37,920
Kashmir will become Pakistan,
without Kashmiri men, with Kashmiri women.

1743
01:59:38,650 --> 01:59:42,643
Who had put these notices outside
the homes of Kashmiri Pandits?

1744
01:59:42,989 --> 01:59:45,408
It is a lie, brother.

1745
01:59:46,406 --> 01:59:48,326
More than 1,000 families were killed.

1746
01:59:48,403 --> 01:59:49,594
Who had ordered those killings?

1747
01:59:49,824 --> 01:59:51,514
You had.

1748
01:59:54,662 --> 01:59:56,544
And one of those families was mine.

1749
02:00:00,346 --> 02:00:02,074
Allah!

1750
02:00:07,334 --> 02:00:09,408
You have heard their side of the story.

1751
02:00:09,715 --> 02:00:11,520
Now it's time you hear
our side of the story.

1752
02:00:13,094 --> 02:00:15,514
No one made the Pandits leave.

1753
02:00:16,397 --> 02:00:17,280
They left on their own.

1754
02:00:17,357 --> 02:00:21,466
Under the guidance of the
Governor and your host Brahma Dutt.

1755
02:00:22,963 --> 02:00:24,960
Some say that they ran away out of fear.

1756
02:00:25,037 --> 02:00:26,842
If the Kashmiri Pandits left on their own,

1757
02:00:26,918 --> 02:00:28,954
then they want to
come back on their own.

1758
02:00:29,069 --> 02:00:30,874
Why are you stopping them?

1759
02:00:31,411 --> 02:00:34,637
There are more than 10,000
Pandits still staying in Kashmir.

1760
02:00:34,790 --> 02:00:36,634
10,000 or 800?

1761
02:00:36,787 --> 02:00:39,130
Not just Pandits,
we also have Sikhs in Kashmir.

1762
02:00:39,206 --> 02:00:41,434
We all live in love and harmony.

1763
02:00:41,587 --> 02:00:42,662
This is what I am trying to say.

1764
02:00:42,739 --> 02:00:45,773
I won't allow colonies of
hatred to exist here.

1765
02:00:46,195 --> 02:00:50,880
If that is the case, why don't you
contest the election like the others?

1766
02:00:52,838 --> 02:00:59,904
Because I am freedom fighter,
not a tool of state like the others.

1767
02:01:01,363 --> 02:01:04,435
Let me tell you something
interesting, Krishna.

1768
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:12,691
When the British Empire ruled this land,
they had a policy.

1769
02:01:13,843 --> 02:01:17,453
They called Congress a Pressure Cooker.

1770
02:01:17,875 --> 02:01:19,565
A Pressure Cooker.

1771
02:01:20,141 --> 02:01:21,600
You know why?

1772
02:01:22,675 --> 02:01:28,051
Because Rajguru,
Ashfaqullah, Azad, Bhagat Singh

1773
02:01:28,243 --> 02:01:31,238
Wanted to get India its independence
through an armed struggle.

1774
02:01:31,315 --> 02:01:34,003
Congress was known as Pressure Cooker.

1775
02:01:34,579 --> 02:01:39,187
So that political activities
also gets a political space.

1776
02:01:40,147 --> 02:01:45,331
That's why Gandhi's non-violent
democratic movement became successful.

1777
02:01:45,946 --> 02:01:49,248
You know who is playing
the role of a Pressure Cooker now?

1778
02:01:50,477 --> 02:01:51,898
We are.

1779
02:01:54,048 --> 02:02:00,115
But your Government is suppressing
this non-violent democratic movement.

1780
02:02:02,573 --> 02:02:05,914
Your Government
cannot tolerate this new-age Gandhi.

1781
02:02:10,061 --> 02:02:13,555
There is just one solution,
for everything.

1782
02:02:13,939 --> 02:02:15,398
Love.

1783
02:02:20,006 --> 02:02:26,880
You had two Prime Ministers,
Nehru and Atal Bihari.

1784
02:02:27,379 --> 02:02:30,643
The only wanted people to love them.

1785
02:02:30,874 --> 02:02:36,403
But what does your current
Prime Minister want?

1786
02:02:37,555 --> 02:02:41,126
He wants people to be scared of him.

1787
02:02:43,507 --> 02:02:47,616
Forget Kashmir and look
at your own country, India.

1788
02:02:48,269 --> 02:02:53,606
All the artists,
thinkers, students, political activists,

1789
02:02:53,683 --> 02:02:57,638
Muslims, Christians, Dalits... are scared.

1790
02:02:57,715 --> 02:02:59,136
They are petrified.

1791
02:02:59,290 --> 02:03:01,363
They live in fear.

1792
02:03:01,786 --> 02:03:05,779
And your master is
happy that people are scared of him.

1793
02:03:09,466 --> 02:03:12,422
You are also facing a case of sedition,
aren't you?

1794
02:03:14,688 --> 02:03:17,645
Do you deserve such a big punishment
for speaking the truth, Krishna?

1795
02:03:19,718 --> 02:03:23,290
Are you truly an enemy of the state?

1796
02:03:25,210 --> 02:03:26,899
Think Krishna.

1797
02:03:27,859 --> 02:03:29,395
Think.

1798
02:03:29,933 --> 02:03:33,619
If you will think about it, you will know,

1799
02:03:33,965 --> 02:03:38,419
whether I am terrorist,
or a freedom fighter.

1800
02:03:39,763 --> 02:03:43,411
You and I are the same, Krishna.

1801
02:03:44,294 --> 02:03:46,483
We have the same aim.

1802
02:03:47,597 --> 02:03:49,133
Freedom.

1803
02:03:49,517 --> 02:03:51,821
Freedom from oppression.

1804
02:03:54,893 --> 02:03:57,811
Here, have some Kahwa.

1805
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:07,296
Krishna, I am pleased that despite being a
Pandit you have decided to support Allah.

1806
02:04:15,283 --> 02:04:16,589
Thank you.

1807
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:20,160
Krishna.

1808
02:04:23,155 --> 02:04:28,915
By the way, I know who killed
your mother and your brother.

1809
02:04:30,797 --> 02:04:33,677
People must have said that I killed them.

1810
02:04:34,483 --> 02:04:36,288
But that is a lie.

1811
02:04:36,826 --> 02:04:39,437
He was my teacher.
I was his student.

1812
02:04:40,013 --> 02:04:42,278
Sharda was like a sister to me.

1813
02:04:43,546 --> 02:04:46,579
This is what their policy is.
Their war policy.

1814
02:04:47,117 --> 02:04:48,845
Do all the damage.

1815
02:04:48,922 --> 02:04:52,109
Do all the murders and
rapes and blame us for it.

1816
02:04:52,224 --> 02:04:56,333
So that they can continue with
their illegal reign over Kashmir.

1817
02:05:01,248 --> 02:05:02,669
Who's 'They'?

1818
02:05:04,013 --> 02:05:07,315
The ones who killed your
mother and your brother.

1819
02:05:08,083 --> 02:05:09,658
Army.

1820
02:05:10,387 --> 02:05:12,115
Indian Army.

1821
02:05:23,174 --> 02:05:24,442
Let's go!

1822
02:05:58,195 --> 02:05:59,770
Krishna.

1823
02:06:01,536 --> 02:06:03,187
Who did you go to meet?

1824
02:06:04,493 --> 02:06:06,144
Some friends.

1825
02:06:08,064 --> 02:06:09,638
Whose friends?

1826
02:06:10,675 --> 02:06:12,403
Friends of the enemies of India,

1827
02:06:12,518 --> 02:06:17,088
or the friends of those
who murdered your parents?

1828
02:06:22,157 --> 02:06:23,885
I know the truth.

1829
02:06:24,115 --> 02:06:25,613
Like?

1830
02:06:26,496 --> 02:06:28,762
Like who killed my parents and my brother.

1831
02:06:29,491 --> 02:06:31,334
I know why my grandfather always
hid the truth from me

1832
02:06:31,411 --> 02:06:34,291
And why all
of you lied to me.

1833
02:06:38,669 --> 02:06:39,667
Lied to you?

1834
02:06:39,898 --> 02:06:41,434
Yes.

1835
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:46,733
You all have spun a web of
lies in order to avoid the plebiscite.

1836
02:06:46,810 --> 02:06:49,267
In order to illegally rule Kashmir.

1837
02:06:49,958 --> 02:06:54,643
You and your system have not only illegally
and unconstitutionally killed my parents

1838
02:06:55,066 --> 02:06:58,675
But you have also killed
Kashmir's past, present and future.

1839
02:06:59,674 --> 02:07:01,786
You guys are murderers, sir.

1840
02:07:02,016 --> 02:07:03,475
Murderers!

1841
02:07:04,896 --> 02:07:08,928
Is this what they told you?

1842
02:07:09,389 --> 02:07:10,502
Yes.

1843
02:07:12,115 --> 02:07:13,613
And you believed it?

1844
02:07:16,109 --> 02:07:17,837
You know why?

1845
02:07:18,490 --> 02:07:20,755
Because you have been brainwashed.

1846
02:07:21,370 --> 02:07:22,906
You are misguided.

1847
02:07:24,058 --> 02:07:25,286
You are a coward.

1848
02:07:25,363 --> 02:07:26,784
A coward.

1849
02:07:27,245 --> 02:07:32,083
And cowards cannot distinguish
between the truth and the lies.

1850
02:07:32,160 --> 02:07:34,656
- Please don't decide for me.
- Stop!

1851
02:07:40,109 --> 02:07:44,755
Have you ever seen a
bullet pierce through a chest?

1852
02:07:47,136 --> 02:07:49,171
One doesn't scream like
they show it in the movies.

1853
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:52,090
He stops breathing.

1854
02:07:53,779 --> 02:07:56,237
Have you seen anyone getting burned?

1855
02:07:56,890 --> 02:08:04,147
What oozes out from their
body is not blood but pus, white pus.

1856
02:08:06,259 --> 02:08:09,907
There is spine-chilling
silence everywhere.

1857
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:17,395
And then piercing through
that silence you hear slogans:

1858
02:08:17,779 --> 02:08:20,429
Freedom! Freedom!

1859
02:08:20,544 --> 02:08:23,347
Freedom! Freedom!

1860
02:08:25,037 --> 02:08:26,957
Freedom!

1861
02:08:29,453 --> 02:08:35,366
The ones shouting these slogans
and celebrating are your executioners.

1862
02:08:35,443 --> 02:08:38,938
Have you witnessed
such a horrific experience?

1863
02:08:40,819 --> 02:08:42,278
You haven't.

1864
02:08:44,083 --> 02:08:45,619
We have seen it.

1865
02:08:46,426 --> 02:08:50,074
That's why you cannot differentiate
between the truth and the lies.

1866
02:08:50,726 --> 02:08:54,336
That's why you don't feel disgusted
while raising the 'Freedom' slogan.

1867
02:08:55,142 --> 02:08:59,597
That's why Kashmiri Pandits have
still not got the justice they deserve.

1868
02:09:00,019 --> 02:09:02,438
All because of traitors like you.

1869
02:09:06,701 --> 02:09:08,582
You want to know the truth?

1870
02:09:09,581 --> 02:09:10,810
Do you have the courage?

1871
02:09:12,115 --> 02:09:13,306
Look at this!

1872
02:09:13,651 --> 02:09:15,187
Look at this!

1873
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:16,646
Look at this!

1874
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:23,443
This contains the truth of your mother,
your father and your brother.

1875
02:09:23,866 --> 02:09:28,205
That you and your
friends hid from the world!

1876
02:11:36,192 --> 02:11:38,035
What is justice?

1877
02:12:05,184 --> 02:12:08,256
This entire game is one of hope.

1878
02:12:09,946 --> 02:12:12,979
That's why they want you to be hopeless.

1879
02:12:14,131 --> 02:12:16,858
They achieve that by misleading you,
killing you.

1880
02:12:18,394 --> 02:12:25,306
As long as even one Kashmiri
Pandit's heart beats for India,

1881
02:12:25,805 --> 02:12:29,338
As long as it yearns
to go back to Kashmir,

1882
02:12:30,989 --> 02:12:32,755
They cannot win.

1883
02:12:34,214 --> 02:12:37,171
And that's why you need
to win this game of hope.

1884
02:12:38,976 --> 02:12:40,627
And that victory will be

1885
02:12:40,704 --> 02:12:42,586
True Justice.

1886
02:12:58,944 --> 02:13:02,362
We will see.

1887
02:13:02,746 --> 02:13:05,894
We will see.

1888
02:13:06,317 --> 02:13:10,157
It is inevitable that we will see.

1889
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:13,075
We will see.

1890
02:13:13,536 --> 02:13:17,146
That day that has been promised.

1891
02:13:17,184 --> 02:13:20,870
That is written in the book of destiny.

1892
02:13:20,947 --> 02:13:23,904
We will see.

1893
02:13:24,442 --> 02:13:28,051
It is inevitable that we will see.

1894
02:13:28,243 --> 02:13:31,315
We will see.

1895
02:13:39,110 --> 02:13:44,448
And only Allah's name will remain.

1896
02:13:46,406 --> 02:13:51,706
And only Allah's name will remain.

1897
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:55,469
Who is both elusive and present.

1898
02:13:55,546 --> 02:13:59,117
Who is the spectacle and the beholder,

1899
02:13:59,232 --> 02:14:03,110
'I am the truth' will be the acclamation.

1900
02:14:03,187 --> 02:14:04,877
Freedom!

1901
02:14:04,954 --> 02:14:06,451
Freedom!

1902
02:14:06,758 --> 02:14:08,333
Freedom!

1903
02:14:08,448 --> 02:14:10,176
Freedom!

1904
02:14:10,291 --> 02:14:12,058
Freedom!

1905
02:14:12,134 --> 02:14:13,709
Freedom!

1906
02:14:13,786 --> 02:14:17,126
'I am the truth' will be the acclamation.

1907
02:14:17,395 --> 02:14:20,851
Which I am and so are you.

1908
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:24,538
And then God's own people will rule.

1909
02:14:24,653 --> 02:14:28,224
Which I am and so are you.

1910
02:14:28,416 --> 02:14:31,603
We will see.

1911
02:14:39,130 --> 02:14:42,470
We will see.

1912
02:14:42,854 --> 02:14:46,387
We will see.

1913
02:14:46,464 --> 02:14:50,266
We will see.

1914
02:15:14,112 --> 02:15:16,186
My young friends of India,

1915
02:15:17,645 --> 02:15:20,486
There is no internet in Kashmir!

1916
02:15:20,640 --> 02:15:24,864
Shame!

1917
02:15:25,709 --> 02:15:28,819
Children are being put in jails!

1918
02:15:28,896 --> 02:15:31,930
Shame!

1919
02:15:32,237 --> 02:15:34,157
Kashmir is under attack!

1920
02:15:34,234 --> 02:15:35,654
Shame!

1921
02:15:35,731 --> 02:15:37,114
Now we will see.

1922
02:15:37,190 --> 02:15:41,453
The way minorities
are being persecuted there.

1923
02:15:41,491 --> 02:15:43,757
The constitution is being murdered.

1924
02:15:44,486 --> 02:15:49,363
And here is a Government that's saying,
"Everything is fine".

1925
02:15:51,283 --> 02:15:53,203
But we won't tolerate this lie anymore.

1926
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:55,584
We won't!

1927
02:15:55,699 --> 02:15:57,850
Now we shall see.

1928
02:15:58,310 --> 02:16:00,768
And we shall see it tonight itself.

1929
02:16:00,922 --> 02:16:03,264
But the true story of Kashmir.

1930
02:16:03,571 --> 02:16:06,797
And the promised truth.

1931
02:16:07,872 --> 02:16:10,253
Will be shown to us by

1932
02:16:11,213 --> 02:16:12,288
Him.

1933
02:16:12,557 --> 02:16:15,706
So, let's give it up for
our Presidential candidate...

1934
02:16:16,550 --> 02:16:17,933
Krishna Pandit!

1935
02:16:24,230 --> 02:16:27,149
Vote for Krishna!

1936
02:16:27,226 --> 02:16:30,566
Vote for Krishna!

1937
02:16:30,643 --> 02:16:33,754
Vote for Krishna!

1938
02:16:33,792 --> 02:16:36,211
Vote for Krishna!

1939
02:16:36,480 --> 02:16:38,131
My God, what an applause!

1940
02:16:38,208 --> 02:16:43,930
Krishna, the world is waiting
witness the truth about Kashmir.

1941
02:16:44,006 --> 02:16:45,696
And now the stage is all yours.

1942
02:16:46,618 --> 02:16:50,266
Tell us what you saw in Kashmir.

1943
02:16:54,605 --> 02:16:58,906
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

1944
02:16:59,059 --> 02:17:02,515
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

1945
02:17:02,592 --> 02:17:06,163
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

1946
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:09,619
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

1947
02:17:09,696 --> 02:17:11,693
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

1948
02:17:15,878 --> 02:17:17,837
I saw an open sky.

1949
02:17:19,565 --> 02:17:21,293
Under the sky,

1950
02:17:21,830 --> 02:17:25,094
There is a paradise surrounded
by the beautiful Himalayan ranges.

1951
02:17:25,286 --> 02:17:33,619
And in that paradise a sage visits
and meditates in the mountains for years.

1952
02:17:33,734 --> 02:17:37,190
Meditates meaning research.

1953
02:17:37,766 --> 02:17:42,413
He researches so that he can
Spread this knowledge across the world.

1954
02:17:43,603 --> 02:17:46,790
That Sage was none
other than Rishi Kashyapa.

1955
02:17:47,251 --> 02:17:51,206
And it was him after whom this
paradise was named...

1956
02:17:51,552 --> 02:17:53,011
Kashmir.

1957
02:17:53,242 --> 02:17:54,624
Good opening.

1958
02:17:54,854 --> 02:17:55,968
Very inclusive.

1959
02:17:56,122 --> 02:18:01,344
Then I saw Shankaracharya
walk there all the way from Kerala.

1960
02:18:02,304 --> 02:18:06,106
Kerala to Kashmir.

1961
02:18:06,682 --> 02:18:10,867
He didn't own a Pushpak Viman,
a flying chariot, so he literally walked.

1962
02:18:13,056 --> 02:18:15,974
He too researched in
the Himalayas for years

1963
02:18:16,051 --> 02:18:20,966
Because the philosophy he was doing his
research on was only possible in a paradise.

1964
02:18:21,696 --> 02:18:23,117
Kashmir.

1965
02:18:23,194 --> 02:18:29,837
Just like our best researchers, scientists,
students go abroad for higher education

1966
02:18:29,914 --> 02:18:34,752
The best of the minds across
India went to Kashmir

1967
02:18:34,829 --> 02:18:38,554
And became Pandits of their fields.

1968
02:18:38,630 --> 02:18:40,896
Pandits like PhD holders.

1969
02:18:41,472 --> 02:18:45,466
I saw that Abhinav Gupta and
Utpaladeva were researching on philosophy.

1970
02:18:46,195 --> 02:18:48,538
Laugakshi was researching on Astronomy.

1971
02:18:49,536 --> 02:18:52,032
He was the first astronomer in the world.

1972
02:18:53,146 --> 02:18:55,373
Charaka and Vagbhata
were researching on Ayurveda.

1973
02:18:55,488 --> 02:18:56,947
Sushruta - Medical science,

1974
02:18:57,024 --> 02:18:57,984
Panini - Grammar,

1975
02:18:58,176 --> 02:18:59,213
Vateshwara - Trigonometry,

1976
02:18:59,328 --> 02:19:00,979
Suyya - Hydraulic Engineering,

1977
02:19:01,094 --> 02:19:02,016
Jayanta Bhatta - Law,

1978
02:19:02,093 --> 02:19:04,282
Kalidasa and Rudrata - Sanskrit Literature,

1979
02:19:04,358 --> 02:19:05,318
Bhama - Aesthetics,

1980
02:19:05,395 --> 02:19:06,854
Sharngadeva - Musicology,

1981
02:19:07,046 --> 02:19:08,621
Vasugupta and Somananda - Advaita,

1982
02:19:08,698 --> 02:19:09,696
Kalhana - History,

1983
02:19:09,773 --> 02:19:11,731
Vishnu Sharma - Moral Science,

1984
02:19:13,766 --> 02:19:15,878
Yes, he wrote the Panchatantra.

1985
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:21,331
I witnessed King Lalitaditya's
bravery and courage.

1986
02:19:21,562 --> 02:19:24,096
I heard Lalleshwari's poems.

1987
02:19:25,594 --> 02:19:29,395
The movies, TV, theatre, web series,

1988
02:19:29,587 --> 02:19:33,427
Basically everything
we watch on Netflix, drama.

1989
02:19:34,042 --> 02:19:35,962
The science behind this drama,

1990
02:19:36,192 --> 02:19:39,264
Natyashastra,
also known as the Fifth Veda,

1991
02:19:39,379 --> 02:19:43,066
Was penned by Bharat Muni in Kashmir.

1992
02:19:43,334 --> 02:19:49,824
I saw these millions of scholars
turning Kashmir into a true paradise.

1993
02:19:50,938 --> 02:19:52,819
Kashmir became the seal of quality.

1994
02:19:53,318 --> 02:19:58,579
That's why the Greeks said,
Kashmir is the cradle of civilization.

1995
02:19:58,963 --> 02:20:03,034
Kashmir was the Silicon
Valley of the first millennium.

1996
02:20:03,110 --> 02:20:04,800
It's just mythology!
It's all a lie!

1997
02:20:04,877 --> 02:20:06,144
Bingo!

1998
02:20:09,830 --> 02:20:11,904
Don't worry,
I think this is all a build-up.

1999
02:20:12,019 --> 02:20:13,555
It is a lie.

2000
02:20:14,054 --> 02:20:15,744
That's what I think as well.

2001
02:20:16,589 --> 02:20:18,394
Because we were never taught
about it in a school or a college.

2002
02:20:18,470 --> 02:20:21,197
It was never a part of
our mainstream history books.

2003
02:20:22,157 --> 02:20:24,346
It's a lie, right?

2004
02:20:24,576 --> 02:20:26,266
That's why it wasn't taught to us.

2005
02:20:27,149 --> 02:20:31,027
If this is a lie then why
did the Buddhists come to Kashmir?

2006
02:20:32,026 --> 02:20:34,214
Why did Nagasena and Ravigupta go there?

2007
02:20:35,904 --> 02:20:41,357
They went there because Kashmir
was the Centre of Knowledge.

2008
02:20:41,434 --> 02:20:43,699
This Info War,
war of knowledge isn't something new.

2009
02:20:43,776 --> 02:20:45,619
It has been going on for centuries.

2010
02:20:46,234 --> 02:20:52,378
If it had been a lie, Islamic Tyrants would
have never invaded Kashmir in the 1300s.

2011
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:57,907
They invaded Kashmir because they knew that
Kashmir was the world's centre for knowledge.

2012
02:20:57,984 --> 02:21:02,016
And the one who can control
the knowledge can rule the world.

2013
02:21:04,166 --> 02:21:05,626
But there was a problem.

2014
02:21:06,509 --> 02:21:07,546
You can seize the land,

2015
02:21:07,661 --> 02:21:12,499
But how do you seize the free minds
of the evolved Pandits, I mean Scholars.

2016
02:21:14,189 --> 02:21:16,339
That resulted in a new game plan.

2017
02:21:17,069 --> 02:21:22,714
The tyrants sent armed soldiers
to convert these Pandits.

2018
02:21:23,482 --> 02:21:25,286
They forced them to convert.

2019
02:21:25,363 --> 02:21:29,587
And the ones who wouldn't
agree to convert were butchered.

2020
02:21:29,856 --> 02:21:34,963
These are the same people
who were persecuted.

2021
02:21:35,078 --> 02:21:36,998
And Kashmiris gave them refuge.

2022
02:21:37,075 --> 02:21:38,803
Hey! What kind of rubbish is this?

2023
02:21:38,918 --> 02:21:40,109
This isn't rubbish!

2024
02:21:40,186 --> 02:21:44,717
This is the exact description in Shamsu'd-Din
Muhammad Araqi's biography Tohfatu'l Ahbab.

2025
02:21:46,099 --> 02:21:47,712
Do you know who Araqi was?

2026
02:21:47,866 --> 02:21:49,056
Huh?

2027
02:21:49,248 --> 02:21:50,784
No?

2028
02:21:52,934 --> 02:21:56,544
You are studying in India's topmost
university but you don't know who Araqi is?

2029
02:21:57,312 --> 02:21:58,310
How would you know about him?

2030
02:21:58,387 --> 02:21:59,808
No one taught you anything about him.

2031
02:22:00,307 --> 02:22:02,381
We all know about Hitler.

2032
02:22:02,458 --> 02:22:07,066
Araqi was an Islamic Tyrant who was
A lot more dreadful than Hitler.

2033
02:22:07,718 --> 02:22:12,250
His sole intention was to destroy
the temples and shrines of infidels.

2034
02:22:13,555 --> 02:22:17,664
To put an end to their
traditions and rituals.

2035
02:22:19,392 --> 02:22:22,426
To destroy innovations
made by the Pandits.

2036
02:22:23,424 --> 02:22:24,768
Someone just told me,

2037
02:22:24,960 --> 02:22:27,878
"Come on dude,
Nazis killed 1000 Jews every day."

2038
02:22:27,955 --> 02:22:29,952
"I have never heard any
such thing happening in Kashmir."

2039
02:22:30,029 --> 02:22:31,526
Well, hear this.

2040
02:22:32,486 --> 02:22:34,598
Under Araqi and his
PM Musa Raina's order

2041
02:22:34,714 --> 02:22:38,285
1,500-2,000 infidels
were captured every day.

2042
02:22:38,362 --> 02:22:41,203
They would cut their
sacred Hindu thread,

2043
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:43,354
They were made to read the Kalma,
the declaration of faith,

2044
02:22:43,430 --> 02:22:45,389
They were circumcised
and forced to eat beef.

2045
02:22:45,965 --> 02:22:48,653
All this was done by their soldiers.

2046
02:22:49,152 --> 02:22:53,914
The ones we know as Sufis and Dervishes.

2047
02:22:55,411 --> 02:23:00,365
Hitler used concentration camps
and Araqi used Qahran and Zabran.

2048
02:23:00,979 --> 02:23:03,053
It means Force and Compulsion.

2049
02:23:03,360 --> 02:23:05,395
You know who described this?

2050
02:23:05,818 --> 02:23:07,430
Araqi's own son.

2051
02:23:07,546 --> 02:23:08,813
And if you want the original manuscript,

2052
02:23:08,890 --> 02:23:12,038
it is available in Research and Publications
Department of Jammu and Kashmir State,

2053
02:23:12,115 --> 02:23:15,149
Under Accession Number 551.

2054
02:23:15,533 --> 02:23:16,454
Must read.

2055
02:23:16,531 --> 02:23:21,178
This is all a lie!

2056
02:23:25,056 --> 02:23:28,205
Kashmir's truth is so true
that we always think that it's a lie.

2057
02:23:29,434 --> 02:23:31,546
In this "Independent" India...

2058
02:23:32,429 --> 02:23:35,386
In this "Democratic" India...

2059
02:23:36,230 --> 02:23:38,419
In this "Secular" India,

2060
02:23:39,571 --> 02:23:44,141
They were once again
ousted with swords and guns.

2061
02:23:47,136 --> 02:23:50,899
Convert! Die! Leave!

2062
02:23:52,934 --> 02:23:57,350
Convert! Die! Leave!

2063
02:24:03,110 --> 02:24:04,416
Do you know what this means?

2064
02:24:04,762 --> 02:24:06,144
Raliv means Convert!

2065
02:24:07,066 --> 02:24:08,794
Chaliv means leave!

2066
02:24:09,024 --> 02:24:10,253
Galiv means Die!

2067
02:24:10,483 --> 02:24:13,632
Convert! Leave! Or die!

2068
02:24:17,165 --> 02:24:19,277
This was their seventh exodus.

2069
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:23,309
And this wasn't an ordinary exodus.

2070
02:24:24,384 --> 02:24:26,918
This time it was a genocide.

2071
02:24:30,605 --> 02:24:32,794
And the story doesn't end here.

2072
02:24:33,638 --> 02:24:35,904
They faced yet another genocide.

2073
02:24:36,288 --> 02:24:39,744
And neither Araqi nor the Terrorists
nor the State were responsible for it.

2074
02:24:40,205 --> 02:24:42,778
But you and I were responsible for it.

2075
02:24:42,854 --> 02:24:43,738
You! You! You!.

2076
02:24:43,814 --> 02:24:45,504
All of you!

2077
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:48,883
When we decided to remove them
from our hearts and our minds.

2078
02:24:48,960 --> 02:24:50,496
And this was the real genocide!

2079
02:24:50,611 --> 02:24:53,069
This is a lie! There was no real genocide.

2080
02:24:53,146 --> 02:24:54,528
We don't want your fake propaganda!

2081
02:24:54,605 --> 02:24:57,638
Listen Krishna,
don't preach, tell us what you saw.

2082
02:25:00,979 --> 02:25:02,362
If we haven't read about it,
it's not a part of our history.

2083
02:25:02,438 --> 02:25:03,629
If we haven't seen it, it hasn't happened.

2084
02:25:03,744 --> 02:25:06,010
So, there was no real genocide in Kashmir.

2085
02:25:06,739 --> 02:25:09,082
If anyone tries to tell the truth,
you say, "Don't Preach!"

2086
02:25:09,427 --> 02:25:10,925
Yes.

2087
02:25:11,578 --> 02:25:14,458
Now he will prove
his own hypothesis wrong.

2088
02:25:15,034 --> 02:25:17,376
I don't bet on ordinary horses.

2089
02:25:18,451 --> 02:25:21,984
The knowledge because of which Kashmir
was known as the Cradle of Civilisation

2090
02:25:22,099 --> 02:25:24,787
was never treated
as a National Heritage by us.

2091
02:25:24,864 --> 02:25:30,317
Now this Knowledge Centre of India
is on the verge of extinction.

2092
02:25:31,085 --> 02:25:33,120
And we aren't even aware of it.

2093
02:25:34,080 --> 02:25:36,998
Say "Shame! Shame! Shame!"

2094
02:25:37,421 --> 02:25:39,187
Why did we divide the dead?

2095
02:25:39,264 --> 02:25:43,488
Why were the ones who died
known as Kashmiris and not Indians?

2096
02:25:43,872 --> 02:25:49,901
They didn't just kill Kashmiri
Pandits in the year 1990.

2097
02:25:51,514 --> 02:25:54,547
They killed all moderate Muslims as well.

2098
02:25:55,546 --> 02:25:56,698
And not just them,

2099
02:25:56,966 --> 02:26:00,691
Sikh, Buddhist, Christian,
Dogra, Gujjar, Dalit

2100
02:26:00,883 --> 02:26:04,301
Whoever raised a voice
against terrorism was killed.

2101
02:26:04,915 --> 02:26:08,179
They even killed the soul of Kashmir.

2102
02:26:08,986 --> 02:26:12,979
Theatre. Art. Music. Literature...

2103
02:26:13,210 --> 02:26:14,784
Everything was banned.

2104
02:26:15,552 --> 02:26:18,086
In 1996, one cinema hall dared to open
its shutters, and they opened fired in it.

2105
02:26:18,163 --> 02:26:19,238
People died.

2106
02:26:19,584 --> 02:26:22,426
So many Temples were destroyed,
set on fire.

2107
02:26:24,346 --> 02:26:26,189
Were they just Temples?

2108
02:26:26,995 --> 02:26:28,531
Were they just Shrines?

2109
02:26:29,107 --> 02:26:31,949
Weren't they pieces of
India's finest architecture?

2110
02:26:32,640 --> 02:26:35,328
Weren't they a symbol
of Indian history?

2111
02:26:35,904 --> 02:26:38,554
Weren't they India's Spiritual Centers?

2112
02:26:40,090 --> 02:26:42,010
Isn't destroying Indian Architecture,
Indian Heritage Centers,

2113
02:26:42,086 --> 02:26:45,773
Indian Spiritual
Centers a cultural genocide?

2114
02:26:45,850 --> 02:26:48,230
Stop this rhetoric, talk facts or shut up.

2115
02:26:48,307 --> 02:26:49,229
Shut up!

2116
02:26:49,306 --> 02:26:50,726
Let him talk.

2117
02:26:51,187 --> 02:26:54,029
- I want to listen.
- Me too!

2118
02:26:54,106 --> 02:26:55,526
Speak up, Krishna!

2119
02:26:55,834 --> 02:26:57,024
Speak up, Krishna!

2120
02:26:57,139 --> 02:26:59,904
Speak up!

2121
02:27:02,438 --> 02:27:04,397
In a television interview,
Bitta had openly accepted

2122
02:27:04,474 --> 02:27:07,046
That he had killed 20 innocent people.

2123
02:27:08,813 --> 02:27:11,654
Yet someone who has killed
Air Force Officers in broad daylight

2124
02:27:11,731 --> 02:27:14,496
Gets invited to India's topmost office.

2125
02:27:15,917 --> 02:27:18,451
Won't you call that
an Administrative Genocide?

2126
02:27:19,066 --> 02:27:21,600
Where will you go after
this function is over?

2127
02:27:21,677 --> 02:27:22,906
Your home?

2128
02:27:23,059 --> 02:27:26,285
No one can dare stop us
from going back to our own homes.

2129
02:27:26,515 --> 02:27:30,240
But will Kashmiri Pandits ever get an
opportunity to go back to their homes in Kashmir?

2130
02:27:30,317 --> 02:27:32,122
Is this Justice?

2131
02:27:40,800 --> 02:27:42,336
I am just a student.

2132
02:27:43,296 --> 02:27:45,984
The so-called Youth of India.
The Future.

2133
02:27:46,867 --> 02:27:49,440
I don't know much about the world.

2134
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:55,315
But I certainly know that a nation
where they there is no Right to Justice.

2135
02:27:56,045 --> 02:27:58,733
Can never be the Universal Guru.

2136
02:28:00,115 --> 02:28:01,613
Radhika.

2137
02:28:04,646 --> 02:28:07,104
Professor Radhika Menon.

2138
02:28:08,218 --> 02:28:11,558
You once told me that
every story has a villain.

2139
02:28:12,826 --> 02:28:14,093
Yes, it is true.

2140
02:28:14,515 --> 02:28:19,469
And there is no villain worse than the one
Who takes a mother away from her child.

2141
02:28:21,005 --> 02:28:27,878
The country where you are
born is known as your motherland.

2142
02:28:29,568 --> 02:28:32,026
So yes, Kashmir is my mother.

2143
02:28:35,635 --> 02:28:39,590
My mother's name was Sharda.

2144
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:42,048
This is her story.

2145
02:28:43,584 --> 02:28:47,040
My brother's name was Shiva.

2146
02:28:48,653 --> 02:28:50,419
This is his story.

2147
02:28:52,032 --> 02:28:54,682
But this is not just
the story of my mother.

2148
02:28:58,253 --> 02:29:00,403
It is the story of your mother as well.

2149
02:29:05,971 --> 02:29:09,389
Now let's watch something
I have never seen before.

2150
02:29:13,843 --> 02:29:16,147
Then you can decide who the culprit is.

2151
02:29:18,643 --> 02:29:20,333
Who should be punished?

2152
02:29:23,251 --> 02:29:25,171
And in the end,

2153
02:29:28,704 --> 02:29:30,970
Place a hand on your heart and decide,

2154
02:29:33,350 --> 02:29:35,270
How do you plan to repent for this,

2155
02:29:38,573 --> 02:29:40,954
And what is your definition of humanism?

2156
02:29:55,469 --> 02:29:57,773
What is that An-Al-Haq?

2157
02:30:01,766 --> 02:30:03,955
What is that Lauh-e-azal?

2158
02:30:11,098 --> 02:30:13,286
"This day that was promised to us!"

2159
02:30:18,739 --> 02:30:20,544
"We will see,"

2160
02:30:25,190 --> 02:30:27,072
Now we will all see.

2161
02:30:34,637 --> 02:30:35,405
Indian Army.

2162
02:30:35,443 --> 02:30:36,365
Sir.

2163
02:30:36,480 --> 02:30:39,706
We have received news that there is going
to be a terrorist attack on the Pandits.

2164
02:30:40,166 --> 02:30:43,661
We need the names and address
of all the Pandits in this area.

2165
02:30:44,851 --> 02:30:45,850
Now listen carefully.

2166
02:30:45,888 --> 02:30:47,885
- You will all leave this village.
- Yes, Sir.

2167
02:30:47,962 --> 02:30:49,344
Now this station is under our command.

2168
02:30:49,459 --> 02:30:50,918
Take all the weapons.

2169
02:30:51,187 --> 02:30:52,493
Indian Army!

2170
02:30:52,838 --> 02:30:56,218
All the Pandits, please step outside.

2171
02:30:56,448 --> 02:30:58,253
We are the Indian Army.

2172
02:30:58,598 --> 02:30:59,866
We are the Indian Army.

2173
02:30:59,981 --> 02:31:02,054
- Father, it's the security force.
- Please step out.

2174
02:31:02,170 --> 02:31:04,090
I think Brahma uncle has sent them.

2175
02:31:04,166 --> 02:31:06,317
- I'll go and check.
- Please step outside.

2176
02:31:06,432 --> 02:31:08,506
We are here for your protection.

2177
02:31:08,621 --> 02:31:10,118
We are here to protect you.

2178
02:31:10,195 --> 02:31:11,424
- Come on, hurry up.
- Please, please.

2179
02:31:11,539 --> 02:31:12,883
We are the Indian Army.

2180
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:14,227
Come on out.

2181
02:31:14,381 --> 02:31:16,416
We are here to protect you.

2182
02:31:16,608 --> 02:31:20,064
- Come with me.
- All the Pandits, please step outside.

2183
02:31:20,179 --> 02:31:22,176
This way please.
Keep moving.

2184
02:31:22,291 --> 02:31:25,171
Everyone, please step outside.

2185
02:31:25,939 --> 02:31:28,704
Everyone, please step outside.

2186
02:31:29,126 --> 02:31:31,085
We are here to protect you.

2187
02:31:31,814 --> 02:31:33,773
Look after him, I'm coming.

2188
02:31:34,771 --> 02:31:36,499
You don't need to be scared.

2189
02:31:36,614 --> 02:31:37,421
Keep moving.
Go on.

2190
02:31:37,536 --> 02:31:38,534
We are the Indian Army.

2191
02:31:38,650 --> 02:31:40,454
We are here to protect you.

2192
02:31:40,531 --> 02:31:42,067
Keep moving.

2193
02:31:42,144 --> 02:31:43,526
Please stand in a circle.

2194
02:31:43,680 --> 02:31:45,677
All the Pandits,
please stand in a circle.

2195
02:31:45,792 --> 02:31:47,328
All the Pandits,
please stand in a circle.

2196
02:31:47,405 --> 02:31:48,403
Listen carefully.

2197
02:31:48,634 --> 02:31:51,514
Only Kashmiri Pandits will stay here.

2198
02:31:51,629 --> 02:31:53,203
Others will step back.

2199
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:55,507
Only Kashmiri Pandits will stay here.

2200
02:31:55,584 --> 02:31:56,928
Others will step back.

2201
02:31:57,005 --> 02:31:58,541
What are you doing?

2202
02:31:58,694 --> 02:32:00,346
They are not the Indian Army.

2203
02:32:00,461 --> 02:32:02,573
- They are...
- Father!

2204
02:32:03,034 --> 02:32:03,802
Father!

2205
02:32:03,878 --> 02:32:05,376
Father! Father!

2206
02:32:05,453 --> 02:32:06,950
Father please get up.

2207
02:32:07,104 --> 02:32:09,139
No. Father please get up.

2208
02:32:09,216 --> 02:32:10,253
Let's escape.

2209
02:32:16,166 --> 02:32:17,395
Bitta.

2210
02:32:22,195 --> 02:32:23,501
Father!

2211
02:32:28,147 --> 02:32:30,067
What do you want?

2212
02:32:31,526 --> 02:32:32,947
No.

2213
02:32:33,254 --> 02:32:39,168
There should be someone to tell the
world of what conspired here today.

2214
02:32:40,474 --> 02:32:47,232
Mr. Pandit, I want you to go and tell everyone
in India what you witnessed here today.

2215
02:32:47,309 --> 02:32:48,576
Oh mother!

2216
02:32:48,768 --> 02:32:49,920
Father!

2217
02:32:51,034 --> 02:32:52,301
No!

2218
02:32:54,067 --> 02:32:55,296
No Father!

2219
02:32:55,373 --> 02:32:56,909
No!

2220
02:33:05,165 --> 02:33:06,086
Father!

2221
02:33:06,163 --> 02:33:07,814
Bloody Hindu!

2222
02:33:09,350 --> 02:33:11,578
Krishna stay here. I'm coming.

2223
02:33:11,693 --> 02:33:12,576
Alright.

2224
02:33:12,653 --> 02:33:13,574
Stay here.

2225
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:15,379
Play with this rice.

2226
02:33:15,610 --> 02:33:16,416
I'm coming.

2227
02:33:16,493 --> 02:33:18,106
Stay here.

2228
02:33:21,984 --> 02:33:23,328
Grandpa!

2229
02:33:23,482 --> 02:33:24,941
Shiva!

2230
02:33:25,171 --> 02:33:26,400
Shiva escape!

2231
02:33:26,669 --> 02:33:27,437
Shiva!

2232
02:33:27,514 --> 02:33:28,819
- Shiva escape!
- Mom!

2233
02:33:28,896 --> 02:33:30,086
Shiva escape!

2234
02:33:30,278 --> 02:33:31,085
Shiva!

2235
02:33:31,162 --> 02:33:31,853
Mom!

2236
02:33:31,930 --> 02:33:32,659
Shiva!

2237
02:33:32,774 --> 02:33:34,157
Shiva, run away!

2238
02:33:34,272 --> 02:33:36,192
Shiva, run away!

2239
02:33:36,307 --> 02:33:37,728
Run!

2240
02:33:38,381 --> 02:33:39,994
Shiva! Shiva!

2241
02:33:40,070 --> 02:33:41,414
Mom!

2242
02:33:44,064 --> 02:33:45,562
Mom!

2243
02:33:47,251 --> 02:33:48,211
Mom!

2244
02:33:48,288 --> 02:33:48,979
Shiva!

2245
02:33:49,056 --> 02:33:52,934
That day I made you eat the rice
drenched in your husband's blood.

2246
02:33:54,624 --> 02:33:56,314
Want to have some drenched
in your son's blood?

2247
02:33:56,390 --> 02:33:57,850
Mom!

2248
02:33:58,195 --> 02:34:05,146
Oh, infidel witch, may your
beautiful hair burn, you broke my heart.

2249
02:34:27,418 --> 02:34:30,144
Today, we shall make them
witness such terror

2250
02:34:30,989 --> 02:34:38,477
That no infidel would dare to
step on the sacred land of Kashmir again!

2251
02:34:39,475 --> 02:34:40,934
Maulvi sir.

2252
02:34:42,970 --> 02:34:46,771
Tell us, how should we treat an infidel?

2253
02:34:46,848 --> 02:34:48,038
Tell us!

2254
02:35:08,851 --> 02:35:10,541
Unbearable, is it?

2255
02:35:19,795 --> 02:35:21,254
Shiva, run away...

2256
02:35:22,099 --> 02:35:23,290
Shiva, run away...

2257
02:35:24,518 --> 02:35:26,515
Shiva, run away...

2258
02:35:36,653 --> 02:35:38,803
Now you will witness something
Like never before.

2259
02:35:48,403 --> 02:35:50,016
Shiva.

2260
02:35:55,277 --> 02:35:56,352
Shiva.

2261
02:35:56,429 --> 02:35:58,234
Shiva.

2262
02:36:00,154 --> 02:36:01,997
Hail Lord Shiva!

2263
02:36:02,112 --> 02:36:03,110
Hail Lord Shiva!

2264
02:36:07,334 --> 02:36:09,370
My mother...

2265
02:36:15,667 --> 02:36:17,126
Mom...

2266
02:36:22,848 --> 02:36:24,307
Mom...

2267
02:36:25,152 --> 02:36:26,650
Keep moving!

2268
02:36:26,726 --> 02:36:28,301
Keep moving!

2269
02:36:28,378 --> 02:36:30,490
Keep moving!

2270
02:36:30,797 --> 02:36:31,757
Go!

2271
02:36:31,834 --> 02:36:33,792
Keep moving!

2272
02:36:33,907 --> 02:36:35,981
Keep moving, you bastards!

2273
02:36:36,096 --> 02:36:38,592
Keep moving!

2274
02:37:02,054 --> 02:37:03,398
3, 4, 5, 6,

2275
02:37:03,437 --> 02:37:04,896
7, 8, 9, 10,

2276
02:37:04,973 --> 02:37:06,816
11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

2277
02:37:06,893 --> 02:37:10,272
16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24.
