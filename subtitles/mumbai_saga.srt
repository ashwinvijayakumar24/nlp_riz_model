1
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,490
The Portuguese named
this city Bom Bahia...

2
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,240
... and gave it as a wedding
gift to the British.

3
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,450
It wasn't their father's property.

4
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,450
And the British changed
its name to Bombay.

5
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,490
Drive faster.

6
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,740
But now enough.

7
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,990
This city won't be known by a name...

8
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,610
... given by the British!

9
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,950
This city belongs
to our Goddess Mumba Devi.

10
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,320
She's our mother.

11
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,740
This city will no longer
be known as Bombay...

12
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,360
... but as Mumbai!

13
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,990
What will it be called?

14
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,360
Mumbai!

15
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,450
- What will it be called?
- Mumbai!

16
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,570
What will this city be called?

17
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,820
Mumbai!

18
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,360
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, sir.

19
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,200
Turn the car around.
Quickly.

20
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,490
Turn it around.

21
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,360
Don't mess with my family.

22
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,240
Turn the car around.

23
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,240
Take a left.

24
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,950
If you mess with a Marathi,
He will hit back.

25
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,610
If anyone dares to take your rights...

26
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,990
... he'll be lying on the
streets covered in his own blood.

27
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,570
I have warned the government...

28
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,610
If you have your guy in Dubai

29
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,070
... I have mine in Dadar..

30
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,990
Stay in line.

31
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,110
Boss.

32
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,990
Let me get into the VIP line please.

33
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,240
It's not for you... for VIPs only.

34
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,820
- A line won't define my status.
- I see...

35
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,990
When you have status
you don't stand in lines.

36
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,200
Stay in your line.

37
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,320
Ok my lord, prayers from here only for today.

38
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,610
Pay up. Pay up. Come on pay up...

39
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,320
Where's the protection money?

40
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Pay up. Pay up.

41
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,320
Come on. Come on.

42
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,450
Cash only. Cash only.

43
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,240
Where's your protection money?

44
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,490
Come on, hurry up, hurry up.

45
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,360
But I paid two days ago.

46
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,820
Rascal!

47
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,070
You paid two days ago, huh!

48
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,320
What is all this?
What is it?

49
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,110
Ours is a partnership,
and this is our share of profits.

50
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,740
All these shops are
Gaitonde's property.

51
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,320
Look at me.

52
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
Our job is
to collect his share...

53
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,700
... your job is to pay
with no questions asked.

54
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,950
Understood.

55
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,860
Come on.

56
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,200
It's become a routine with them.

57
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,740
They come,
they scare, they take our money.

58
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,240
Nonsense...

59
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,450
This is not acceptable.

60
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,860
It is...

61
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,740
It has always been,
and always will be.

62
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,610
If not Gaitonde,
there will be some Shinde or a Lande.

63
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,990
- This will continue.
- You're absolutely right, father.

64
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,110
Someone's always going to be there.

65
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,990
Yes someone will always be around,
but it won't be you.

66
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,990
The local boys have no
guts to stand up to anyone.

67
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,990
Do you seriously think
I'll get all wired up with your speech...

68
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,610
... and go beat them up.

69
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,820
Stop your drama and go to college.

70
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,490
No one's going to get
into a fight for your sake.

71
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,610
I can see that.

72
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,490
See what?

73
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,950
How you waste your days at the gym
evenings with volleyball,

74
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,110
and nights with carrom.

75
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,820
Your entire life revolves around it.

76
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,990
And you're busy building hospitals,
aren't you?

77
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,490
Someday I will.

78
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,820
Do come if you need treatment...

79
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,610
... only if your
blood starts to boil.

80
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,450
Come, I'll drop you to school.

81
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,990
If we wait here any longer,
she'll make my life hell.

82
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,200
Come on.

83
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,360
Bye.

84
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,110
One bread-butter and tea.

85
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,490
Careful.

86
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,240
What a guy...

87
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,610
Are you playing on our team or theirs?

88
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,610
- I missed...
- Balls you missed.

89
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,070
Out with the truth now.

90
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,450
How many cream rolls
did he offer you?

91
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,110
Speak up. Come on.

92
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,490
Leave it,
he's always going to be a loser.

93
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,570
I'll show you someday...

94
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,360
A man should have nerves of steel...

95
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,320
... even cats have long whiskers.

96
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,860
Where's the protection money?

97
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,610
- How old are you?
- Thirty-two.

98
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,110
- And I am twelve.
- Quite the grown-up.

99
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,990
Not yet, I am not.

100
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,490
But in a couple of years I'll
be 20, and you'll be 40.

101
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,740
I'll be bigger and stronger...

102
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,200
... but you won't be.

103
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,740
If we meet again,
then what will you do?

104
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,740
What will I do?

105
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,860
What will I do?

106
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,990
Amartya.

107
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,990
Gaitonde's men are beating up Arjun.

108
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,570
Arjun!

109
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,490
Arjun!

110
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,360
Amar. I've brought dinner.

111
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,240
Sit.

112
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,490
I stay quiet for his sake.

113
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,610
Even my blood boils...

114
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,860
Even I get furious...

115
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,110
But I stay quiet for his sake.

116
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,610
Because if anything happens to me...

117
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,070
... there will be no
one to look after him.

118
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,200
I know.
We all know.

119
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,110
And if anything had happened to him...

120
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,950
... then no one could've controlled me.

121
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,490
Hey.

122
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,240
How is your brother?

123
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,570
Tell that rug rat
not to be a wise-guy.

124
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,360
You managed to save
his life yesterday.

125
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,110
But the next time I'll
chop his head off and throw him down.

126
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,820
Now pay up.

127
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,990
Whoever pays them...

128
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,610
... will lose his arm next!

129
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,740
No more protection money!

130
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,110
Rascal!

131
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,740
Who chopped off Potya's hand?

132
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,740
He's a local kid, sir.

133
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,070
His name is Amartya.

134
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,450
What hole were you in
when he was chopping his hand?

135
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,070
I... that...

136
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,610
That?

137
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,240
Do you have that?

138
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,450
Then why were you
watching like a coward?

139
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,360
You get paid by the government
and me too...

140
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,950
... but work for neither.

141
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,950
What's your job?

142
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,860
What is your job?

143
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,570
To look the other way.

144
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,990
When?

145
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,990
When my boys are bashing someone up.

146
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,610
Not when my guys
are getting bashed up.

147
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,700
Understood.

148
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,740
I want to see that guy in here before 5pm.

149
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:32,610
Otherwise, I'll make you wipe
Potya's ass for the rest of your life!

150
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,740
Understand?

151
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,820
What are you still sitting here for?

152
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,490
Get up. Go...

153
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,950
Enjoying a meal here.

154
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,240
- Shengya...
- Yes, boss.

155
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,070
Send that builder in.

156
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,490
- Chopped off his hand.
- Totally.

157
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,240
And beat everyone up.

158
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,490
Left, right, and centre.

159
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,820
Shut up!

160
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,110
It's all your fault.

161
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,740
Why did you have to argue with them?

162
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,490
Huh...

163
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,490
I never said a word for your sake.

164
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,110
And you want to be a hero.

165
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,700
Amartya.

166
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,110
Your time's come.

167
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,240
Come, the boss is calling you.

168
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,860
I've a question, Mastekar.

169
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,200
You don't have a tail...

170
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,860
... then what do you
wag in front of Gaitonde?

171
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,240
Take him in!

172
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,110
No one touches me.

173
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,740
I'll come myself.

174
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,490
Look after him.

175
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,610
Take him away.

176
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,740
Let's go.

177
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,450
Wait. Wait. Wait.

178
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,070
Did you chop Potya's hand?

179
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,320
He lay a hand on my brother.

180
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,700
And anyway, I did him
a favor by chopping his hand.

181
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,360
He can't take protection
money anymore...

182
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,450
... but at least he can beg.

183
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,070
After I am through with you,
you won't even be able to beg.

184
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,490
Take a look.

185
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,450
Take one good last look at
the setting sun.

186
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,860
Because it won't rise for you again.

187
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,490
Have you ever heard about
the night not letting the sun rise.

188
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,490
Nari Khan.

189
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,740
Amartya Rao.

190
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,740
I'm serving time for narcotics.

191
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,990
And you?

192
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,450
For daring.

193
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,110
Beat him!
Beat him!

194
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,240
Beat him!
Beat him!

195
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,860
Kill him!

196
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,990
Hey...
Stay back!

197
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,990
Back.

198
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,320
Gaitonde, that's enough!

199
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,490
Gaitonde!

200
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,950
Look at the sun!

201
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:08,490
From now it'll
rise only for me.

202
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:15,240
Your story's over,
and my saga begins!

203
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,360
Amartya Rao, you've been given bail.

204
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:41,990
Amartya.

205
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,740
When faced with obstacles,
most collapse...

206
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,360
... and some rise up.

207
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,320
It's time for you to rise.

208
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,070
Here.

209
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,110
You'll need this.

210
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,490
Goodbye.

211
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,860
Father.

212
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,450
Is everything alright, son?

213
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,360
I was worried about you.

214
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,490
Come on, uncle.

215
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,360
You didn't give birth to a son...

216
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,070
You gave birth to a legend.

217
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,360
- How is Arjun?
- He's doing well...

218
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,110
... in the VIP ward.

219
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,570
Who put him there?

220
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,990
The same guy who bailed you out!

221
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,740
Bhau.

222
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,240
He wants to meet you.
He's sent a car.

223
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,700
Ask.

224
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,070
Bhau, rumours are
that you had a hand...

225
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,990
... in the Behram Baug riots last week?

226
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,990
You got it wrong.

227
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,490
Not just a hand,
I had my leg in there too.

228
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,610
It was a kick on their asses.

229
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:41,110
I called him up and told him...
to handle the situation.

230
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,700
Otherwise, I'd have to handle it.

231
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,950
- Did I tell you or not?
- You did, Bhau.

232
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,610
And that's what I did.

233
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,450
My boys struck them
in their own territory.

234
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,490
But innocent lives
were also lost in the clash.

235
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,990
When a shot is fired the bullet
is blind to caste or creed.

236
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,990
So do you take
responsibility for the riots?

237
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,490
I only take responsibility
for keeping my city clean.

238
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,610
But people say that
you're spreading terror.

239
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,990
- They are scared of you.
- That's good.

240
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,110
They should be scared!
Right?

241
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,700
- But Bhau, Democracy...
- This is my Democracy!

242
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,820
- And how do you justify it?
- I don't have to.

243
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,320
- Patil.
- Sir...

244
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,360
- The interview is over.
- Yes, sir.

245
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,990
See you.

246
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,490
Patil.

247
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,200
All okay?

248
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,490
Bhau, this is Amartya.

249
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,070
Sit.

250
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,490
So... you want to be a gangster?

251
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,200
I'm here because
I was trying to be a brother.

252
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,990
But looking at your splendor...

253
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,320
... I think it's better to be You.

254
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,860
Patience. Patience.

255
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,950
Your time will come.

256
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,490
Everyone's time comes.

257
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,110
But I'll have my era.

258
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,490
Not without my support.

259
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,610
When I beat up Gaitonde's
boys in the market...

260
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,570
... I was alone.

261
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,740
When I fought all day in jail...

262
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,110
... I was still alone.

263
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,110
Why would I need you now?

264
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,490
You will.

265
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,740
A soldier can be smart...

266
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,740
... but he needs an army to win wars,

267
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,110
which I have.

268
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:57,490
I've seen your brawn,
now I want to see your brain.

269
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,610
Gaitonde is your problem.

270
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,990
Not mine, he's your problem.

271
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,740
Meet me after a week.

272
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,360
When you have a
solution to the problem!

273
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,860
- Grandpa...
- Here comes my child.

274
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,860
Your vacation is over alreadyâ€¦

275
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,360
I always lose track
of your holidays.

276
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,490
Focus on your studies. Okay.

277
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,700
Go on.

278
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,860
Which school does he go to?

279
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,070
I'll study properly in Bombay.

280
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,450
And won't get into any trouble.

281
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,950
This is not a punishment.

282
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,860
This is for your own good.

283
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,610
This is your home now...

284
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,740
... away from the filth of Bombay.

285
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,570
Even during your vacations,
you won't come to Bombay.

286
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,110
I'll come here instead.
Understood.

287
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,360
Can't do it.

288
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,570
You'll have to do it.

289
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,200
Now hurry up, or you'll be late.

290
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,740
Take care.

291
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,990
What's wrong?
Aren't you happy?

292
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,990
I am.

293
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,740
Then why do you have
tears in your eyes?

294
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,860
I am all alone now.

295
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,320
Alone, huh?

296
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,110
What happened?

297
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,110
Take care of him.
He's all alone now.

298
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,110
What?

299
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,860
Amar, shall we start planning?

300
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,990
Think again.

301
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,990
Once we get in, there's no way out.

302
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,490
It's a one-way ticket.

303
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,490
He got in the day
he chopped Poytya's hand.

304
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,360
After all that's happened,
Gaitonde won't backdown.

305
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,820
Meaning?

306
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,610
Meaning we'll have to go after him.

307
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,950
We're only a dozen
while he has an army.

308
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,490
So what?

309
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,740
Even we'll have an army.

310
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,450
I'll go to our neighborhood...

311
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,240
... and gather the boys.

312
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,820
But still Amar, it's dangerous.

313
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,950
Danger only gets worse if you don't face it.

314
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,610
So now?

315
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,610
I have a solution.

316
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,700
The boat over there.

317
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,950
You want to finish Gaitonde...

318
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,740
... then hit him where it hurts.

319
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,360
How?

320
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,240
By making your own territory...

321
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,700
... by chasing him
out of his.

322
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,820
Only if your guts are greater
than your strength can you rule this city.

323
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,950
Do you have the guts?

324
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,860
It's all we have.

325
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,570
What do we have to do?

326
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,110
First things first,
you need to get a van.

327
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,110
Not from Dadar.
Someplace far.

328
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,740
Vasai. Virar.
Or even Panvel.

329
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:14,450
After that, you need to abduct this man.
Gaitonde's right hand.

330
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,740
Listen you idiot...

331
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,610
Answer our questions if
you know what's best for you.

332
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:50,200
Otherwise, your head will be sitting over
there talking to the rest of your body.

333
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,450
Understood.

334
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:02,450
Now... where does Gaitonde
store his weapons?

335
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,490
Tell me.

336
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,490
Did you hear?

337
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,860
Can you hear now?

338
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,570
Start talking.

339
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,610
I won't ask again.

340
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,320
I'll tell you. I'll talk.

341
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,240
There are three places.

342
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,490
Mazgaon Jetty.

343
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,860
Gokhle Garage. And...

344
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,490
Oh, God.

345
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,820
...Dadar Mill.

346
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,320
Now beat him.

347
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,740
But I told you everything.

348
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,110
Exactly.

349
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,240
I don't like traitors.

350
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,740
Make sure he doesn't
wake up for three days.

351
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,990
No.

352
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,610
Ahire.

353
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,610
Ahire.

354
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,490
Singhya...

355
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:15,860
In these guns is your
strength and your protection.

356
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:17,570
Fire.

357
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,490
But who do we shoot at?

358
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,320
What's the hell?

359
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,450
It's empty.

360
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,110
I wanted to see whose
hand shivers while firing a gun.

361
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,240
Anna, even his feet
are shivering. Look.

362
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,990
From here... straight.

363
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,740
- We want a leader like...
- Vishal Patil.

364
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,740
- Glory to...
- Jan Seva Party!

365
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,490
- We want a leader like...
- Vishal Patil.

366
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:24,610
- We want a leader like...
- Vishal Patil.

367
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,360
What is this?

368
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,610
Go back.

369
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,200
This is Gaitonde's area.

370
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,360
Jan Seva's rally.

371
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,990
And you want us to go back.

372
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,240
I don't care whose rally this is.

373
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:55,360
And this is my area now.

374
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,990
Are you trying to scare us with a gun?

375
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,200
I carry a gun because I like to.

376
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,360
To scare the likes of you,
my name is enough

377
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,360
Rao...

378
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:16,740
Amartya Rao.

379
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,990
This is your sacred boundary.

380
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,110
When a goddess crossed it,
it led to a battle.

381
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,860
If you do, it'll lead to a War!

382
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,610
Let's go.

383
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,110
Salutations Bhau.

384
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,490
Your back?
Sit.

385
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,860
You gave me a week.

386
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,950
And you came back in 5-days.

387
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,490
Isn't that what you want to say?

388
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:45,360
Is your brother doing
well at the boarding school?

389
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,740
He's doing great.
Thank you.

390
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,990
You see...

391
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,070
When you have nothing to lose...

392
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,860
... you have the entire world to conquer.

393
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,200
I'll do that too, Bhau.

394
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,490
Just need your blessings.

395
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,860
From today

396
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,240
Mumbai city is yours.

397
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,320
Go rule.

398
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,450
Nari bhai,
you've been granted bail.

399
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,110
Unbelievable.

400
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,110
I knew you will come back.

401
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,110
From today Nari Khan
will be known by another name.

402
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,610
The Brother's brother.

403
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,360
What's this for?

404
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,860
For the next meeting!

405
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,740
Don't be scared, Gaitonde.

406
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,990
If he can come this far,
he can also kill you.

407
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:36,200
- He's come to talk.
- Tell me.

408
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,490
If you hadn't screwed up,
I'd be still looked upon as a clean man.

409
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,360
I don't understand...
Are you complaining or are you thanking me.

410
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:49,740
Complaints are for family,
which you're not.

411
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:56,360
And I thank only the lord above.

412
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,950
I came here to tell you Gaitonde...

413
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,740
... that from Dadar to Byculla
is now my area.

414
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,450
Your area...

415
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,360
fine.

416
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,950
I've spent 23-years
in this business.

417
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,490
The only thing I learnt
in these last 23-years is...

418
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,990
... that nothing is permanent here.

419
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,070
Nothing.

420
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,360
Understood.

421
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:27,490
Yesterday it was mine,
today it's yours...

422
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,360
...and tomorrow it'll be someone else's.

423
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,110
Until then... long live Mumbai.

424
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,700
Enjoy.

425
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:41,110
I won't enjoy... I'll rule!

426
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:59,360
"Glory to Lord Ganesha..."

427
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,860
"Ganesha... Ganesha... Ganesha..."

428
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:05,110
"Your devotee has arrived, o Lord."

429
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,200
"You're his saviour, o Ganesha."

430
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,490
"He's come with folded
hands and an overwhelmed heart..."

431
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,700
"... only you dwell in it, o Ganesha."

432
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,990
"Glory to Lord Ganesha..."

433
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,240
"Glory to the Benevolent Lord."

434
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,490
"Your devotee has arrived, o Lord."

435
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,700
"You're his saviour, o Ganesha."

436
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,950
"He's come with folded
hands and an overwhelmed heart..."

437
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,990
"... only you dwell in it, o Ganesha."

438
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,240
"Those who pray to you,
know your strength."

439
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,360
"You desecrate all our worries."

440
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,490
"Beat the drums aloud..."

441
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:46,740
"... here comes Lord Ganesha."

442
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,990
"Let your heart beat aloud."

443
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,360
"... here comes Lord Ganesha."

444
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:56,490
"Beat the drums aloud..."

445
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,820
"... here comes Lord Ganesha."

446
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:02,990
"Let your heart beat aloud."

447
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:06,490
"... here comes Lord Ganesha."

448
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,950
"The benevolent one,
the generous one..."

449
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:13,200
"The protector of good...
destroyer of evil."

450
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,740
"The wise one..."

451
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,320
"Lord Ganesha..."

452
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,990
"The wise one..."

453
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,450
"Lord Ganesha..."

454
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:22,740
"Destroyer of all sorrows,
provider of happiness."

455
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:26,070
"Lord Ganesha..."

456
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:29,740
"Ganesha... Ganesha... Ganesha..."

457
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:33,240
"Glory to Lord Ganesha..."

458
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,740
Thanks.

459
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,240
So... dad, you were saying?

460
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,360
I didn't send you to Harvard...

461
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,950
so you could come back
and try to convince me...

462
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,570
... that the mill your
grandfather built from scratch

463
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:56,740
should be sold.

464
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,240
Don't scream,
father-in-law.

465
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,240
It's not good for
your blood pressure.

466
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:06,490
Look, dad, even if your 5600 workers

467
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,860
work for a lifetime...

468
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,450
... they won't earn for you what I can...

469
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,740
... with this single deal.

470
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:15,740
And our mill's land, which is on lease...

471
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,990
And was impossible to sell earlier...

472
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:21,320
... can now be sold.

473
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:26,820
The Ministry has changed
its laws to make it possible.

474
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,610
Laws have been changed
because you bribed the ministers

475
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,070
with the same greed.

476
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,200
Everyone wants a piece
of this city to make money.

477
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,740
So what's wrong with that?

478
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,240
Every person wants
to earn money, dad.

479
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,360
Listen, dad.

480
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,860
My grandfather built this
mill from scratch.

481
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,950
Why?

482
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,110
To make money right?

483
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,990
To do business.

484
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,200
Not for charity.

485
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,740
And dad, the past and
the future are both called tenses.

486
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,570
We have to decide which
tense we want to live in.

487
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,110
I don't know about your future...

488
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,240
... but this mill is not for sale...

489
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,740
... not as long as I'm alive.

490
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,490
Fuck.

491
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:38,610
Arjun, here are your shirts...

492
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,110
What's wrong with you?

493
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,610
Why the long face?

494
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,240
I don't want to go to London.

495
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,950
You've been living
alone for 8-years,

496
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,740
... never even wrote a letter.

497
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,490
And suddenly you're
getting emotional about

498
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:54,700
leaving your brother
and me.

499
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:00,610
Oh I see... these feelings
are for someone else.

500
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,820
So who is she?
What does she do?

501
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,360
Her name is Neelam.

502
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,860
We used to study together.

503
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:08,990
So what's the problem.

504
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:13,070
What if she marries
someone else after I leave?

505
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:15,110
Who will get her married?

506
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,490
Her father.

507
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:17,820
Have you seen your brother?

508
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,200
He's the Godfather.

509
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,570
I'll handle it.

510
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,490
Does she have a passport?

511
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,950
Yes, she does.

512
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:30,740
But passport...

513
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,490
She'll need it for her London visa.

514
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,990
Didn't she tell you?

515
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:39,070
What, dear?

516
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,860
No, she did tell me...

517
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:46,110
First the wedding,
and then London...

518
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,990
... for Arjun to finish
his higher studies.

519
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,490
But why now?

520
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:50,610
Why not?

521
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,990
Don't worry.
Just tell us the venue.

522
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,490
We'll make all the arrangements.

523
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:57,490
You see, no one says no to him.

524
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,110
No one...

525
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:05,490
He likes oats, cereals,
bread and butter for breakfast.

526
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:06,990
He loves meat.

527
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:09,950
But please stay away
from beef and pork.

528
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,450
And it's cold there, Make sure he
wears a jacket at all times.

529
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:13,490
Otherwise, if Arjun sneezes there...

530
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,240
... his brother will catch a cold here.

531
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:21,070
Brother, this is a one-way ticket.

532
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,110
Yes, because I don't want
you to come back to this city.

533
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,860
Just like in school...

534
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:30,110
... Even when you have vacations,
I'll come and see you there.

535
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,360
It's okay.

536
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,490
Let's go.

537
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,490
He's all alone again.

538
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:55,820
Why will he be alone?

539
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,860
You guys are there no for him.

540
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:00,860
Let's go.

541
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,070
Your fathers dead...

542
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,070
... and these mill
workers are feeling orphaned.

543
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:32,200
Since they are orphaned,
Make them homeless too.

544
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:36,990
20,000 for vacating every
worker out of their home!

545
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:38,490
20,000!

546
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:46,360
What about the worker's wife,
children, mother, father, uncle?

547
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:50,240
Do I drag them out for free?

548
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,360
What do you mean?

549
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,700
Meaning, according to my
calculations, with this deal...

550
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:00,610
... you stand to make
a profit of 8 billion.

551
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,610
And you're offering me 90 million.

552
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,450
Look here.

553
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:06,820
What do I look like to you?

554
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:13,490
Loose change is for beggars,
not partners.

555
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:20,450
I want 15%

556
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:29,240
- Done.
- Done! Done! Done!

557
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:33,860
Great.

558
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:58,950
The Portuguese named
this city Bom Bahia...

559
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,610
And you know what...

560
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,740
They gave it as a wedding
gift to the British.

561
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,360
They thought it was their father's property.

562
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:16,200
And the British changed
its name to Bombay.

563
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:17,990
But now enough.

564
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:20,950
Our city won't be known by a name...

565
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:22,990
... given by the British!

566
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:24,740
This city belongs
to our Goddess Mumba Devi.

567
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,360
She's our mother.

568
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:30,070
This city will no longer
be known as Bombay...

569
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:31,820
... but as Mumbai!

570
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,360
What will it be called?

571
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:36,110
Mumbai!

572
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,610
- What will it be called?
- Mumbai!

573
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,990
What will this city be called?

574
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:44,070
Mumbai! Mumbai! Mumbai!

575
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,860
Greetings, Bhau.

576
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,570
It's heavy.

577
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:07,990
But do you know what
is heavier than a gun?

578
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:10,820
Money.

579
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,860
With money,
one can buy as many of these.

580
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,610
Khaitaan has joined hands with Gaitonde.

581
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:21,950
Now... after the mill deal,

582
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:24,610
Khaitaan won't have
any shortage of money...

583
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,860
... and Gaitonde of guns.

584
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,360
Clip Khaitaan's wings and Gaitonde
will come crashing to the ground.

585
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:36,860
If you want to move ahead in life,

586
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,490
then always remember two things.

587
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:46,110
Who you want and what he wants!

588
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,200
I want the votes
of those mill workers...

589
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:53,610
... and they want their rights.

590
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,740
And I want what you want.

591
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,200
Don't worry.

592
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:05,360
Amartya... you're my pride.

593
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:10,240
Don't ever let it down.

594
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,490
Never.

595
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,110
You won't win this race.

596
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,490
We'll only know after the race ends.

597
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,570
Any deal that gives you Gaitonde's friendship...

598
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,320
... along with Amartya Rao's enmity...

599
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:14,200
... can never be very profitable.

600
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,860
I don't need you to
teach me profit and loss.

601
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:21,860
I went to Harvard
University for that.

602
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,490
But looks like you didn't learn anything.

603
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,070
It's not too late yet.
Mend your ways.

604
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,110
It's already too late, Amartya Rao.

605
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,320
The race has already begun
and the bet has been placed.

606
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,360
And my bet is on Gaitonde.

607
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:38,240
And one doesn't change
bets in the middle of the race.

608
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:41,990
In a race of horses,
you've bet on a mule.

609
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:44,990
Your car is bulletproof...

610
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:49,950
Your not.

611
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,450
Come on!

612
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,610
- Where to?
- To meet Gaitonde.

613
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,450
No cars allowed beyond this point!

614
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:28,110
What is this?

615
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,490
Enough!

616
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:50,490
What's wrong?

617
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,490
I don't want to
do business with you.

618
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:58,700
What's wrong with you?
Why so angry?

619
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:01,490
I don't want to risk
my life just to make money.

620
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:03,360
But who is going to kill you?

621
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,360
Amartya Rao.

622
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,490
Inspite of having you on my side he dared
to publicly threaten me at the racecourse.

623
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:15,240
He might even kill me.

624
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,740
24-hours.

625
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:21,450
You have only 24-hours
or else the deal's cancelled.

626
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:30,950
Amar has thrown a stone...

627
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:36,070
... I'll reply with a flower.

628
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:41,990
But the flower will be on his grave.

629
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,490
Look...

630
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:56,110
Arjun!
Here.

631
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:59,450
So... you've grown even bigger and taller.

632
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:01,740
Stop it, brother.
How much bigger will I get now?

633
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:09,110
But Arjun,
you shouldn't have come back.

634
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,740
- But...
- It's his brother's birthday.

635
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,360
How could he not come?

636
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,070
Okay. Come. Let's go.

637
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,200
Baba... Jagannath?

638
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,570
Don't be afraid.
Look behind.

639
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:35,110
- Neelam!
- Arjun!

640
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,570
Let's go. Come on.
Hurry up!

641
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,320
You shouldn't have come back.

642
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,570
I...

643
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:47,490
This is why I kept
you away for 10-years.

644
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,860
And now you show up
to stick your head into the fire.

645
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:55,360
Have you lost your mind!

646
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:59,240
But brother, I only wanted
to give you a surprise.

647
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,490
They shot at you, Arjun!

648
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,740
You could've lost your life!

649
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,240
They came to kill you!

650
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,240
Is this how you want to surprise me?

651
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,610
But nothing happened.

652
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,200
I won't do it again.

653
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,450
Please talk to him.

654
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:16,740
Amar...

655
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:18,820
I am not a kid anymore.

656
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,200
Hey...

657
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:22,070
You'll always be a kid for me.

658
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,200
Understood!

659
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:38,360
They shouldn't have attacked Arjun.

660
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,990
I'm done talking.

661
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,490
It's time to put an end to this story.

662
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,740
Drive faster.

663
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:35,700
What are you doing?

664
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,450
Turn it around.
Quickly.

665
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:47,860
Turn the car around!

666
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,860
Move, move fast.

667
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,110
By attacking my brother.

668
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:37,110
You turned this race
track into a jungle

669
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:42,990
And in the jungle,
only the fittest survive.

670
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:09,450
I warned you...

671
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:11,360
Your car is bulletproof...

672
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:13,490
Not you.

673
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:45,860
It's a temple.

674
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:47,820
No guns!

675
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:26,240
I think you're in a
hurry to meet your Creator.

676
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:29,990
I just came to tell you Gaitonde...

677
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,990
... whenever you lay
a finger on my brother,

678
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:35,490
your men will either lose an arm...

679
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:37,740
... or a head.

680
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:40,450
As for meeting with the Creator...

681
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:43,860
I've already sent,
your partner Khaitaan, to meet his.

682
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:48,320
Look at these stairs, Gaitonde.

683
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,110
We're both standing
in the same place.

684
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,490
Except for one difference...

685
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:03,490
You're going down,
and I am going up.

686
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:22,990
Commissioner!

687
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:30,570
Six hours ago, Amartya Rao...

688
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:33,490
... murdered a reputed
industrialist on the streets.

689
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:38,860
An industrialist who was
going to change the face of Bombay...

690
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:41,240
... and put it on the map of the world.

691
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:44,200
My husband. Sunil Khaitaan.

692
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:51,990
I lost a husband,
But the real loss is of Bombay city.

693
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:55,240
100 million!

694
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:59,360
100 million to the officer who puts
a bullet in Amartya Rao's head!

695
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:13,110
What do you think, Sir?

696
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,360
Will Amartya die?

697
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:18,450
The question is not
whether Amartya will die?

698
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:27,740
The question is what will I
do with a 100 million.

699
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,860
Don't challenge our pride.

700
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,610
If you awaken a sleeping tiger...

701
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,610
... he will tear you apart.

702
01:02:54,860 --> 01:03:00,110
Don't mess with my family.

703
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:06,450
If you mess with us,
We will hit back.

704
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:08,610
What did I say?

705
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:11,990
If you mess with us,
We will hit back.

706
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:14,820
Hit back! Hit back!

707
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:17,240
If anyone dares to takes your rights...

708
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:21,240
... he'll be lying on the
streets covered in his own blood.

709
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,320
I clearly told the government...

710
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:27,360
... If you have your guy in Dubai,

711
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:31,110
I have mine in Dadar.

712
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:35,990
My brothers,
for the blessings of Chhatrapati...

713
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:38,610
... and the pride of our people,

714
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:42,450
you must vote for Chhtrapati's
army in the coming elections...

715
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:45,070
- Long live...
- Marathi Unity!

716
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:47,360
- Long live...
- Marathi Unity!

717
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,820
- Long live...
- Marathi Unity!

718
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,490
Long live...

719
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,740
Long live...

720
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:02,570
Come. I need to hear
other slogans from you.

721
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:15,740
Everyone has a favorite
spot which changes with time.

722
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:19,570
As a kid the park near my house
was my favorite.

723
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:22,990
When in school it was the last row in class.

724
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:24,610
In College it was the canteen.

725
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:30,610
When I got a girlfriend
it was the corner seats of the theatre.

726
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:33,700
And once I wore
this Police uniform...

727
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:35,450
... and became an
encounter specialist...

728
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:40,860
... this has been my favorite spot.

729
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:48,740
I've got something to show you.

730
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:53,570
Look.
Look.

731
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:00,110
I brought them all here.

732
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:07,820
Don't worry,
I'll give you a chance to run too.

733
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:13,110
Run!

734
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:01,990
No, sir.
I don't want to go anywhere.

735
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:05,990
Scared.

736
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:07,820
Ask me whatever you want.

737
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:09,610
I'll tell you everything.

738
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:10,820
You will!

739
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:15,990
A dog always pees in the same place.

740
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:20,860
Chandu, Jadhav, Mahesh, Gotya,
and Mangu... Where do they go?

741
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:22,860
Tell me.

742
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:25,490
Speak up.

743
01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:27,570
The food was too
spicy today, Babban.

744
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,490
Next time I won't eat here.

745
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:31,950
See you.

746
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:38,700
Hey, Chandu.

747
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:41,740
Will you get in or run?

748
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:58,490
Where do you think you're going?
You don't even give me a look now.

749
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,990
You won't screw anyone today,
Jadhav.

750
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:09,860
It's your turn to get screwed today.

751
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:23,240
First strike is mine, Gotya.

752
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:33,490
So what's on the menu today?

753
01:07:33,570 --> 01:07:35,740
Fish curry, crab, and fish fry.

754
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:37,490
And a police bullet for dessert.

755
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:21,860
Come out, Ganpat.

756
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:23,820
Else the car will need to
be washed from the inside as well.

757
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:35,860
Chandu in front
of the roadside stall.

758
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:37,990
Jadhav in a whore house.

759
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:41,110
And Gotya... he was playing carrom
in the neighbourhood.

760
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,450
He shot him there.

761
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:45,820
Manku in the hermitage...

762
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:50,110
... and that Mahesh was
visiting his mistress.

763
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,740
And he shot him there.

764
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,610
I've known Manku for so long.

765
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:58,860
Even I didn't know
he had a mistress.

766
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:01,700
You didn't know, but someone did.

767
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:03,820
Jadhav, Chandu, Gotya, Manku...

768
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:05,200
About everyone.

769
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:07,610
When you plan to steal from a house

770
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:09,450
... The servant is the first guy
you need on your side.

771
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:13,110
There's an informer among us.

772
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:16,110
Who could it be?

773
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:18,820
The one who is not here.

774
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:21,740
Sadashiv.

775
01:09:22,570 --> 01:09:24,360
Arjun, what are you saying?

776
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:26,820
Sada?

777
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:30,240
Never. It's not possible.

778
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,490
He's our childhood friend.

779
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:35,320
He's a buddy.

780
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:36,950
The thing about betrayal is...

781
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,360
... it's always someone
special who does it.

782
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:47,200
Call Sadashiv and tell
him to meet me at Five Gardens.

783
01:09:48,490 --> 01:09:49,610
What?

784
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:51,360
What if he sends cops there?

785
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:53,320
That's what I've got to see.

786
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:38,950
Wait.

787
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,820
Crime Branch head office.

788
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:11,240
The place is swarming
with cops, sir.

789
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:14,990
I guess you're laying the
bait for a big player.

790
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,740
Hitting a boundary on a small field
doesn't make the player big.

791
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,820
He won't last too long.

792
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,950
I guess luck was on his side today.

793
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:27,860
He survived.

794
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,820
He'll have to be lucky
every time to get away from me.

795
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:34,820
But I'll have to be
lucky only once to kill him.

796
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:37,490
Luck is like a car's gear, sir.

797
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:42,860
Shift it at the right time and
it changes the pace of your life.

798
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:47,070
Nice punch line.

799
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,360
Did you come to Bombay
to become an actor?

800
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,740
You're very clever, sir.

801
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:54,700
Got me in the first meeting.

802
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,610
- How much?
- Let it be, sir.

803
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,070
I can't take money from you.

804
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:10,360
I am not that kind of cop.

805
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:12,240
I knew that right away.

806
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:15,740
But I don't often get
a chance to help the Law.

807
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:17,990
Just shake hands Sir.

808
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:21,990
Whenever luck is on your side,
and you get that player...

809
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:27,820
... I'll proudly say that
I shook hands with death.

810
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:53,950
- Everything alright?
- No.

811
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:56,320
I called you so many times, Amar.

812
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:57,820
Why didn't you answer my calls?

813
01:12:57,860 --> 01:12:59,110
I am okay.

814
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:01,860
I couldn't stop worrying about you.

815
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:04,110
Couldn't focus on anything.

816
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:07,110
I don't answer your calls only
when death is in front me.

817
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,610
Today it was sitting on the backseat.

818
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:12,200
Come.

819
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,490
So Sadashiv sold us out.

820
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:19,860
He didn't sell out.

821
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:23,860
He got scared.

822
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:29,740
My information was right, sir.

823
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:32,200
Amar was supposed
to come to Five Gardens.

824
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:33,610
He himself told me.

825
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:34,950
Then why didn't he show up?

826
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,200
There can only be one reason.

827
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:41,860
He knows that it's me.

828
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:44,740
He won't spare me now.

829
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:49,320
He won't spare you, that's why we're
taking you to your hometown.

830
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:51,860
Go there and lead a quiet life.

831
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:56,820
Where are you going?

832
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:01,450
There are no office rooms on a moving train

833
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:04,240
We're going to the bathroom.

834
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:23,990
You broke our trust for money,
Sadashiv.

835
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:26,490
Not for money.

836
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,610
In exchange for my life!

837
01:14:31,490 --> 01:14:36,110
If I hadn't told that inspector
everything, he would've shot me.

838
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,450
That would've been better.

839
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:40,610
You would've died as a loyal friend.

840
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:42,360
Now you'll die a traitor.

841
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:22,990
Why, Sada?

842
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:25,450
Why, Sada?

843
01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:28,700
Baba, you're my brother.

844
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:31,240
Forgive me.

845
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:33,950
I was scared.

846
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:36,240
How many creams rolls
was it this time?

847
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:40,360
I had no guts.

848
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:43,450
And I... was cornered.

849
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:59,490
Here.

850
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:02,610
What's the second packet for?

851
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:03,990
For taking a bullet!

852
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:27,240
You'll shot Sadashiv in broad daylight!

853
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,860
Fired at cops!

854
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:31,360
How did you dare help Arjun
without my permission?

855
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:34,490
He thought my life
was a bigger priority.

856
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:40,320
Baba knows that I would've
killed Sadashiv anyway.

857
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:45,490
Who gave you the
right to kill Sadashiv?

858
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:50,240
I picked up a gun,
so you never have to!

859
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:54,360
I shed blood but never
let a drop fall on you.

860
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:56,110
And you want to kill people.

861
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,740
I will.

862
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:00,110
I killed just one today.
Tomorrow there may be a dozen against you!

863
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:01,700
I'll kill all of them.

864
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,450
You did everything
you could for me, brother!

865
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:09,240
Now it's my turn.

866
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:12,610
You're not the only one
that gets to be a good brother.

867
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:40,990
You did more than you could, Amar.

868
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:45,990
Now destiny too has to play it's part.

869
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,240
Greetings, Bhau.

870
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,450
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

871
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:22,360
Amar...

872
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,950
I told you to scare Khaitaan,
not kill him.

873
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:31,200
You fired shots here...

874
01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:34,490
... And they were heard all the way in Delhi.

875
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:37,570
I can understand why
you killed Sadashiv.

876
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:39,610
He was an informer.

877
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,610
But shooting those cops?

878
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:48,360
They were paid to take the bullets.

879
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,950
Now they'll get a medal,

880
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:55,490
instead of an inquiry.

881
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:58,320
Get him a chair.

882
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:08,990
The silence in the jungle
announces the lion's presence.

883
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:11,700
And people don't wander
into the jungle out of fear.

884
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:17,070
But when the lion comes to the
city to hunt...

885
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:20,860
... the entire city
unites to kill him.

886
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:22,990
What do you want me to do?

887
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,320
Leave the city.

888
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:30,110
Even the country.

889
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,860
If the chief runs away

890
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:33,360
then what about his army?

891
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:36,490
A dead chief is
no good for the army.

892
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:41,110
If the army exists,
so will the chief.

893
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:46,820
Let Arjun lead the
army for a few days.

894
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:12,360
Vijay.

895
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,240
Even his brother has joined the gang now.

896
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,700
What's your plan?

897
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:57,610
In the Mahabharat Arjun shot the arrow
into the bird's eye.

898
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:59,610
I am going to aim
for Arjun's eye instead.

899
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:02,070
He'll lead us to Amartya.

900
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:05,990
And then?

901
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,570
Then I'll get my shot, sir.

902
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:30,860
Welcome, sir.
Welcome.

903
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:32,860
Come, sit.

904
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:35,990
So glad you could make it, Sir.

905
01:21:38,490 --> 01:21:42,490
You couldn't have managed even a small
affair on a constable's salary...

906
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,490
... but look at this.

907
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:48,570
This is enough to pay for
the whole department's daughters weddings.

908
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:52,860
Sir, meet my wife and daughter.

909
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,700
- Hello.
- Hello.

910
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:56,820
Sir, please bless my child.

911
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:58,070
Take his blessings.

912
01:21:58,740 --> 01:21:59,860
God bless you.

913
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:03,570
Your father's taken a lot of trouble
for the sake of your happiness... .

914
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,610
... and he'll keep doing it.

915
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:08,990
- Sir, have some sweets.
- Sir...

916
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:10,240
I don't eat sweets.

917
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:11,860
But give him.

918
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,860
He loves to eat.

919
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,240
Right?

920
01:22:16,990 --> 01:22:17,990
Please...

921
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:20,200
Thank you.

922
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:27,070
Open your mouth.

923
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:28,110
Huh?

924
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:29,990
Open your mouth, Samant.

925
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:33,610
You will open your mouth.

926
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:40,610
Now...

927
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:46,820
... open your mouth wide and tell me...

928
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:49,360
... who killed Sadashiv?

929
01:22:50,490 --> 01:22:52,450
And how much did you
get paid for it?

930
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:56,820
Otherwise, I'll shove the wedding
trumpet up so far...

931
01:22:58,490 --> 01:23:01,490
... that you'll be
breathing through it.

932
01:23:03,610 --> 01:23:06,360
It was a mistake, Sir. Forgive me.

933
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:07,860
Name!

934
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:13,200
Arjun Rao.

935
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:39,570
Savarkar. Encounter Specialist.

936
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:44,820
He's come to talk.

937
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:47,990
Arjun, be careful.

938
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:13,820
The Police always comes unannounced.

939
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:16,990
Bad news and bad times
also come unannounced.

940
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,240
Even Sadashiv's death
came unannounced.

941
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:22,110
Why did you cross my path?

942
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:25,240
Not just your path,
I've crossed your stars.

943
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:27,990
The government gave you
a uniform, a gun...

944
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:29,990
... and God gave you fingers.

945
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:33,360
Doesn't mean you
finger everyone?

946
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:35,990
You shot our boys on the streets,

947
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:38,990
the whore house, the garage...

948
01:24:40,490 --> 01:24:42,110
But you shot them all
in the back.

949
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:45,490
Shoot me from the front.

950
01:24:47,070 --> 01:24:48,740
I won't turn my back.

951
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:56,490
I don't need a gun to put you down.
For that the law is enough.

952
01:24:57,570 --> 01:24:58,820
Your educated, right?

953
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:03,740
Read this.
And read it carefully.

954
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:09,360
Call up your brother and tell
him that you're done.

955
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:11,740
Because Savarkar's
charged you with TADA.

956
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:16,490
See you in court.

957
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,570
And yes...

958
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:22,740
... if you have a death wish,
then don't come to the court.

959
01:25:23,570 --> 01:25:25,820
Because as soon as the
court declares you an absconder...

960
01:25:26,110 --> 01:25:28,490
... I'll gun you down
in the middle of the street.

961
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:32,240
And not in the back
I'll shoot you in the chest.

962
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:50,240
Savarkar is cunning.

963
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:52,070
He's put Arjun in a complicated situation
by charging him with TADA.

964
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:54,860
He knows there's no bail in TADA.

965
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,490
If Arjun doesn't
show up in the court,

966
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:59,860
they will declare him an absconder.

967
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,860
We're stuck between the devil
and the deep blue sea.

968
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:06,360
Where else will Arjun
go after getting arrested?

969
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:10,200
Arthur Road Jail.

970
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:14,490
And Arthur Road Jail is
more of Gaitonde's fortress.

971
01:26:15,490 --> 01:26:17,820
Where he can easily
kill Arjun.

972
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:19,110
Who is the judge of the TADA court?

973
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:21,070
Justice Malkani.

974
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:22,820
Malkani...

975
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:27,740
But if the judge is on Bhau's payroll,
then what are we afraid of?

976
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:29,860
Even if the judge
is on Bhau's payroll...

977
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:32,990
... Arjun will still have
to go to court for bail.

978
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:35,200
Where he will be attacked.

979
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:11,240
Arjun!

980
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,200
- Mrs. Rao.
- Doctor...

981
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:32,490
The vitals are good.

982
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,990
The bullet has hit on
the spinal thoracic vertebra.

983
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:37,740
His nerves are damaged.

984
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:39,700
Meaning?

985
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:42,570
- He won't be able to walk.
- What?

986
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:44,240
He's paralyzed!

987
01:29:01,490 --> 01:29:03,740
He used to sell vegetables earlier...

988
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:07,610
... now he'll be a
vegetable all his life.

989
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:15,110
Amartya must be really sad today...

990
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:18,570
... he must be wishing why
didn't the bullet kill him.

991
01:29:18,610 --> 01:29:25,360
Now the snake will
come out of his burrow.

992
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:31,820
Sir...

993
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:34,820
Mhatre, I want cops on all
entry and exit points.

994
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:36,240
Sir.

995
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:39,700
- Hello.
- Seema.

996
01:29:40,450 --> 01:29:41,820
Greetings, Bhau.

997
01:29:41,950 --> 01:29:43,740
God bless you, Seema.

998
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:47,360
- Where is Amar?
- He isn't here.

999
01:29:49,490 --> 01:29:51,110
Tell him to stay away from Mumbai.

1000
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:54,860
After what happened with Arjun,
no one can stop him.

1001
01:29:55,450 --> 01:30:01,490
Look, Seema, Amar's enemies
are waiting for this opportunity.

1002
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:04,110
He knows, Bhau.

1003
01:30:04,490 --> 01:30:07,240
And even I know he'll be
loyal to every relationship...

1004
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:10,950
... as a brother and as a foe!

1005
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:14,700
Tell him these are Bhau's orders.

1006
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:16,820
His life vests in you, Bhau...

1007
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,610
But for his brother...
He can give up his life.

1008
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:53,490
What's going on?

1009
01:30:53,570 --> 01:30:55,490
A large mob has barged
inside and they're protesting.

1010
01:30:55,570 --> 01:30:58,320
They claim that a child died
because of a doctor's negligence.

1011
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:00,320
Are all the officers in place?

1012
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:01,610
Some are posted outside
Arjun's room, sir.

1013
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:03,610
The rest are helping
in controlling the crowd.

1014
01:31:06,110 --> 01:31:07,200
It's a setup.

1015
01:31:07,610 --> 01:31:09,110
This mob is here to distract us.

1016
01:32:41,610 --> 01:32:42,860
Are you in pain?

1017
01:32:43,490 --> 01:32:44,740
Not much.

1018
01:32:45,950 --> 01:32:47,360
Everything will be fine.

1019
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:49,110
I left Seema back in London.

1020
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:51,740
They have the best doctors.
Don't be scared.

1021
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:57,360
With you brother fear is the only
thing I never learned.

1022
01:32:57,990 --> 01:32:59,200
And I won't now.

1023
01:32:59,450 --> 01:33:01,240
Does fate test everyone...

1024
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:03,740
... or does it have
a grudge with me only?

1025
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,860
The younger brother who
can't walk manages to escape.

1026
01:33:17,610 --> 01:33:19,240
And the older brother is missing.

1027
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:21,610
And no one knows where they are.

1028
01:33:22,570 --> 01:33:23,740
What is this nonsense?

1029
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:26,200
Are we a joke, Vijay?

1030
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:30,070
- We need results.
- Sir.

1031
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:37,360
Yes, Seema.

1032
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:39,110
Arjun's with me at Bhau's farmhouse.

1033
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:41,240
We're safe here.

1034
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:43,820
Fine, we'll talk later.

1035
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:48,110
Everything's ready.

1036
01:33:48,570 --> 01:33:51,820
We'll take down that bloody
Gaitonde on his own turf.

1037
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:53,490
Not yet.

1038
01:33:53,610 --> 01:33:55,740
We must get Arjun out first.

1039
01:33:56,450 --> 01:33:58,490
And for that,
I must meet with Nari Khan.

1040
01:33:58,570 --> 01:34:00,240
- I'll fix it.
- Ok.

1041
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:09,360
Amar, until the Khaitaan murder
case isn't shut...

1042
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:11,990
... the Police won't
stop chasing you.

1043
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:14,240
I know.

1044
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:17,240
And I also know there's
no way out of here.

1045
01:34:18,950 --> 01:34:21,110
- There is a way.
- What?

1046
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:27,820
If one of us confesses
to killing Khaitaan...

1047
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,240
... then the Police
will stop chasing you.

1048
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:32,360
Who will do that?

1049
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:36,610
- Me.
- Have you lost your mind, Jaggan?

1050
01:34:37,570 --> 01:34:40,610
No one put a gun to our head
to come into this line of work.

1051
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:46,240
We entered this line on our own.

1052
01:34:48,990 --> 01:34:51,700
Knowing fully well where it ends.

1053
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:55,860
And when you're in trouble...

1054
01:34:58,990 --> 01:35:00,860
... how can I rest easy?

1055
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:14,860
Take care.

1056
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:32,110
Sit.

1057
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:33,490
Sir, are you serious?

1058
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:38,110
Archenemies often
keep a tab on each other.

1059
01:35:38,610 --> 01:35:40,490
Prepare to go to Gaitonde Chawl.

1060
01:35:40,570 --> 01:35:41,610
Come on.

1061
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:53,110
What are you doing?

1062
01:35:54,450 --> 01:35:56,200
We're going to Gaitonde Chawl,
right?

1063
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:58,570
We can't go there in our uniforms.

1064
01:35:58,610 --> 01:36:00,990
The mob there...

1065
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:04,820
I mean it's less dangerous
in plain clothes.

1066
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:06,240
Danger?

1067
01:36:06,990 --> 01:36:08,320
We're cops.

1068
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,820
What can be more dangerous
than our uniforms?

1069
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:13,610
After four years of training...

1070
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:17,700
... we stood under the scorching sun
in this uniform and took an oath.

1071
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:21,490
Not so we can take it off for
cheap criminals like Gaitonde.

1072
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:23,490
Why do you carry these stars
on your shoulders then?

1073
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:24,610
Take them off!

1074
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:29,610
If we can proudly pin
a medal on this uniform...

1075
01:36:31,070 --> 01:36:32,490
... then we can also
take a bullet on it.

1076
01:36:47,740 --> 01:36:48,860
Sir, we're ready.

1077
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:41,240
Cops are coming!
Hide the guns!

1078
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:42,570
Come on. Quickly.

1079
01:37:42,610 --> 01:37:43,700
Hurry up.

1080
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:44,990
Gather everything around.

1081
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:47,240
Run! Run!

1082
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:07,240
Tell that rat to
come out of his hole.

1083
01:38:09,070 --> 01:38:10,360
If I can come till here...

1084
01:38:10,490 --> 01:38:12,320
... I can also put
a bullet in his head.

1085
01:38:17,950 --> 01:38:20,990
Don't worry,
if I wanted to kill you...

1086
01:38:21,820 --> 01:38:23,490
... you'd already be dead by now.

1087
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:27,740
There's still time for you
to meet your maker Gaitonde.

1088
01:38:29,610 --> 01:38:30,610
So what do you want?

1089
01:38:31,490 --> 01:38:32,490
Amartya Rao.

1090
01:38:32,990 --> 01:38:34,490
Amartya...
He's in my pocket.

1091
01:38:34,610 --> 01:38:35,950
Put your hand in
and take him out.

1092
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:37,820
How can I give you Amartya?

1093
01:38:38,490 --> 01:38:39,610
You will...

1094
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:42,360
Because people like you keep
more tabs about your enemies.

1095
01:38:43,990 --> 01:38:48,360
Meaning... the enemy of my enemy...
is my friend?

1096
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:52,490
No.

1097
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:54,240
We can never be friends.

1098
01:38:55,740 --> 01:38:57,110
But if you give me Amartya...

1099
01:38:57,240 --> 01:38:59,240
... then I might drop the
idea of becoming your enemy.

1100
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:07,990
I won't count to three.

1101
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:11,860
In fact, I won't count at all.

1102
01:39:12,070 --> 01:39:13,240
Have you lost your mind?

1103
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,200
Put it down.
Put it down. Put it down.

1104
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:18,360
- What if it fires?
- It will...

1105
01:39:18,570 --> 01:39:20,110
If you don't start talking.

1106
01:39:21,740 --> 01:39:23,200
Nari Khan.

1107
01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:26,610
Amartya's old friend.

1108
01:39:27,070 --> 01:39:28,990
They are always together.

1109
01:39:29,950 --> 01:39:31,740
He's changed his appearance now.

1110
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:36,610
But he's still got
an evil mind.

1111
01:39:37,110 --> 01:39:38,610
Where is Nari Khan?

1112
01:39:39,110 --> 01:39:42,950
Keep a lookout on the
Daman-Gujarat border.

1113
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:46,820
There's an Amazon bar out there.

1114
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:48,360
Nari Khan goes there often.

1115
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:51,700
He does all his narcotics
deals over there.

1116
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:54,200
Hopefully you may find Amartya there.

1117
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,860
Determination drives me, not hope.

1118
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:13,450
"Yo Yo Honey Singh."

1119
01:40:17,450 --> 01:40:18,860
"Make some... Make some..."

1120
01:40:19,450 --> 01:40:21,110
"Make some... Make some..."

1121
01:40:21,610 --> 01:40:23,360
"Make some... Make some..."

1122
01:40:24,110 --> 01:40:25,570
"Make some... Make some..."

1123
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:27,820
"No one's ever escaped my sight."

1124
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:29,990
"I can make you dance into the night."

1125
01:40:30,110 --> 01:40:32,070
"Keep dancing till
the sun comes up..."

1126
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:34,450
"... and your feet start to swell up."

1127
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:36,610
"I am the cure to your pain..."

1128
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:38,860
"... I will make you forget your bane."

1129
01:40:38,990 --> 01:40:41,070
"My business is not straight..."

1130
01:40:41,110 --> 01:40:43,490
"... Chaos is what I create."

1131
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:45,490
"That's why..."
"Make some... Make some..."

1132
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:47,740
"Noise!"
"Make some... Make some..."

1133
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:49,990
"Noise!"
"Make some... Make some..."

1134
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:52,240
"Rock it... Rock it."

1135
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:54,490
"The floor."
"Rock it... Rock it."

1136
01:40:54,570 --> 01:40:56,740
"The floor."
"Rock it... Rock it."

1137
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:07,610
"Make some... Make some..."

1138
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:09,950
"Make some... Make some..."

1139
01:41:10,820 --> 01:41:11,860
"Rock it... Rock it."

1140
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:13,450
"The floor."

1141
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:16,740
"I'll spare no one in this party..."

1142
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:18,860
"... break your legs if you do not party."

1143
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:20,990
"Whether I grow bottles on trees..."

1144
01:41:21,070 --> 01:41:23,360
"... or make everyone sway to my beats."

1145
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:25,490
"Breathe free... don't choke to death."

1146
01:41:25,570 --> 01:41:27,740
"Roll some grass little by little."

1147
01:41:27,860 --> 01:41:29,990
"If you don't trust
the dope you receive..."

1148
01:41:30,110 --> 01:41:32,950
"... use it first
And then believe."

1149
01:41:32,990 --> 01:41:34,490
"Make some... Make some..."

1150
01:41:34,570 --> 01:41:36,610
"Noise!"
"Make some... Make some..."

1151
01:41:36,820 --> 01:41:38,860
"Noise!"
"Make some... Make some..."

1152
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:41,110
"Rock it... Rock it."

1153
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:43,360
"The floor."

1154
01:41:43,490 --> 01:41:45,490
"The floor."

1155
01:41:48,610 --> 01:41:49,950
"Make some... Make some..."

1156
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:52,110
"Rock it... Rock it."

1157
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,450
"The floor."

1158
01:41:54,950 --> 01:41:55,990
"Pick up the booze..."

1159
01:41:56,070 --> 01:41:57,110
"... let your body loose."

1160
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:59,360
"And till the lights fuse..."

1161
01:41:59,450 --> 01:42:01,570
"... I'll keep loving you
till you drop."

1162
01:42:01,610 --> 01:42:04,490
"I won't misuse you,
but make you pop."

1163
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:05,950
"Don't be shy, come closer."

1164
01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:08,200
"Take me in your arms...

1165
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,450
"... let the fun begin."

1166
01:42:10,490 --> 01:42:12,860
"Every day you'll say..."

1167
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:14,490
"Make some... Make some..."

1168
01:42:14,610 --> 01:42:16,610
"Noise!"
"Make some... Make some..."

1169
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:18,860
"Noise!"
"Make some... Make some..."

1170
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:21,110
"Rock it... Rock it."

1171
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:23,320
"The floor."

1172
01:42:23,490 --> 01:42:25,570
"The floor."

1173
01:42:28,570 --> 01:42:29,820
"Make some... Make some..."

1174
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:31,570
"Yo Yo Honey Singh."

1175
01:42:32,990 --> 01:42:33,990
"Homie..."

1176
01:42:34,610 --> 01:42:35,610
"From Delhi..."

1177
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:37,110
"Make some... Make some..."

1178
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:39,070
"Make some... Make some..."

1179
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:04,490
Amartya.

1180
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:17,610
Amartya, didn't you hear me?

1181
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:19,740
Are you talking to me?

1182
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:22,990
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

1183
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,110
And I think you just gave
away your fake disguise.

1184
01:43:28,490 --> 01:43:31,990
By bowing your head in front of a temple.

1185
01:43:32,450 --> 01:43:35,610
You changed you looks,
but not your habits.

1186
01:43:36,950 --> 01:43:38,450
Some habits are hard to quit...

1187
01:43:39,570 --> 01:43:41,070
... like the habit to stay alive.

1188
01:43:41,950 --> 01:43:46,110
Don't worry, I'll make
you quit that soon.

1189
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:49,070
When it's time to do or die...

1190
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:52,990
... then one prepares.

1191
01:43:53,450 --> 01:43:54,860
And I am always prepared.

1192
01:43:55,820 --> 01:43:58,200
I was even prepared when
you were sitting behind me.

1193
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:04,360
I'm prepared now
when you are in front of me.

1194
01:44:04,950 --> 01:44:08,860
Doesn't matter how hard you try...

1195
01:44:09,610 --> 01:44:11,490
... but you can't
get this player out.

1196
01:44:11,610 --> 01:44:14,610
As I said, to escape my bullet
you'll have to be lucky at all times...

1197
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:17,860
... but I'll have
to be lucky just once.

1198
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:22,740
Then let's see whether
luck smiles on you...

1199
01:44:23,610 --> 01:44:27,950
... or I still have a chance left.

1200
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,450
Hello.

1201
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:26,110
Hi. Come, sit.

1202
01:46:28,110 --> 01:46:29,990
This is Joshi.

1203
01:46:30,610 --> 01:46:32,820
He is in Narcotics.

1204
01:46:32,860 --> 01:46:34,700
Joshi, tell him.

1205
01:46:35,490 --> 01:46:36,610
Tell him everything.

1206
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:40,360
Savarkar and I took our
Police training together.

1207
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:43,110
I've known him for a long time.

1208
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:44,740
So?

1209
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:48,070
We were youth leaders in Bhau's party.

1210
01:46:55,950 --> 01:46:59,360
Every year dozens of
boys from Bhau's party...

1211
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:01,950
join the Police force...

1212
01:47:02,610 --> 01:47:05,110
... and some of us make it
to very senior postings.

1213
01:47:05,740 --> 01:47:07,740
But not without Bhau's approval.

1214
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:12,070
Promotions, departments, transfers.
Bhau decides everything.

1215
01:47:12,820 --> 01:47:17,450
Meaning Bhau has his own
force within the Police force.

1216
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:23,610
So, senior officers like you and
Savarkar still take orders from Bhau?

1217
01:47:23,860 --> 01:47:27,490
We only take orders from Bhau.

1218
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:31,860
Leave alone an encounter
We don't even file a report without his orders.

1219
01:47:31,990 --> 01:47:33,450
You work for Bhau.

1220
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:35,860
Savarkar also works for Bhau.

1221
01:47:36,820 --> 01:47:38,740
Then why is he after you?

1222
01:47:40,990 --> 01:47:43,450
That's a question
Bhau will have to answer.

1223
01:48:06,110 --> 01:48:09,360
What's the emergency...
That you had to call me here, Amar?

1224
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:15,360
Your dog came to bite me,
but could only manage to bark.

1225
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:21,950
Savarkar was in your party
before joining the Police force.

1226
01:48:22,070 --> 01:48:23,200
So what?

1227
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:25,110
He's gets his salary from the government...

1228
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:29,360
... but orders from you.

1229
01:48:32,610 --> 01:48:37,490
Amar, for a guy who earns 7000 a month...

1230
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:40,610
... a 100 million
is a lot of money.

1231
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:47,990
Forget loyalty, people sell their souls
For that kind of money.

1232
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:56,990
You need to focus on getting
your brother out of here.

1233
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:02,360
Keeping Vijay out of your way
is my guarantee.

1234
01:49:08,990 --> 01:49:10,360
So long, Bhau.

1235
01:49:20,740 --> 01:49:21,820
See you.

1236
01:49:40,950 --> 01:49:42,110
Greetings, Bhau.

1237
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:47,860
Viju, you know Amartya works for me right?

1238
01:49:48,860 --> 01:49:50,200
And still you're going after him.

1239
01:49:51,610 --> 01:49:53,240
At times one has
to do his duty too, Bhau.

1240
01:50:00,570 --> 01:50:02,740
Never forget one thing Viju,

1241
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:06,610
I put you where you are.

1242
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:11,240
People like you uphold the law for me...

1243
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:16,610
... and people like Amartya
break the law for me.

1244
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:20,240
in your own capacity
you both work for me.

1245
01:50:20,860 --> 01:50:22,610
You are two sides
of the same coin.

1246
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:27,990
And when the time
comes to flip the coin...

1247
01:50:28,860 --> 01:50:31,570
... I decide who wins and who loses.

1248
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:36,740
Okay Bhau on your orders...

1249
01:50:36,860 --> 01:50:39,860
I'll get out of Amartya's way.

1250
01:50:41,990 --> 01:50:43,360
Good.

1251
01:50:45,110 --> 01:50:47,570
But if you get out of his way
then who will get him out of the way?

1252
01:50:58,200 --> 01:50:59,990
I'll come back as
soon as Arjun is settled.

1253
01:51:01,820 --> 01:51:03,450
We'll handle everything.

1254
01:51:03,570 --> 01:51:04,950
No one's going to last against us.

1255
01:51:05,860 --> 01:51:06,990
I know.

1256
01:51:07,070 --> 01:51:10,990
Always told your father
He didn't give birth to a son...

1257
01:51:11,110 --> 01:51:13,240
He gave birth to a legend.

1258
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:16,490
You have to be careful from now on.

1259
01:51:18,610 --> 01:51:20,450
We've got no one on our side, Baba.

1260
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:22,740
Not even Bhau.

1261
01:51:25,490 --> 01:51:27,610
Our strength is no longer above us...

1262
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:30,740
... it's within us.

1263
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:34,610
Don't worry, I'll handle things.

1264
01:51:41,490 --> 01:51:43,200
Take care.

1265
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:05,450
What do you think, brother?

1266
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:09,450
Does fate write our story,
or do we?

1267
01:52:10,490 --> 01:52:14,320
Fate takes control
only when we let it.

1268
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:16,110
Did I decide this for myself?

1269
01:52:17,610 --> 01:52:19,240
It was destined, it happened.

1270
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:22,240
I was writing your destiny.

1271
01:52:24,110 --> 01:52:27,490
And everything was
fine until I was doing it.

1272
01:52:31,570 --> 01:52:32,570
Yes, Seema?

1273
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:33,820
Are you okay, Amar?

1274
01:52:33,950 --> 01:52:34,950
I am on the airstrip.

1275
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:36,200
Arjun's with me.

1276
01:52:37,700 --> 01:52:38,780
I was worried.

1277
01:52:38,820 --> 01:52:40,030
When are you not worried?

1278
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:42,320
Just wasn't getting a good feeling.

1279
01:52:42,450 --> 01:52:43,950
We'll leave as soon
as the plane arrives.

1280
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:47,780
Remember Amar,
if anything happens to you...

1281
01:52:48,530 --> 01:52:50,320
... then there will be
no one to look after me.

1282
01:52:53,650 --> 01:52:54,780
I know.

1283
01:52:57,950 --> 01:52:59,070
The planes' here.

1284
01:53:00,070 --> 01:53:01,320
I'll call you as soon as we board.

1285
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,820
Tower, jeep on the runway.
Turning around.

1286
01:54:03,950 --> 01:54:05,700
Hey... what's going on?

1287
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:08,070
There is a jeep on the runway, sir.
The plane will crash.

1288
01:54:09,070 --> 01:54:10,650
Land the bloody plane.

1289
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:13,280
I said land the bloody plane.

1290
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:15,530
Alright.

1291
01:57:51,030 --> 01:57:52,700
- Are you alright?
- I am alright.

1292
01:57:53,070 --> 01:57:54,950
But how did the inspector
find out we were here?

1293
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:02,070
Come.

1294
01:58:18,070 --> 01:58:19,320
Start the engine.

1295
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:37,650
Brother!

1296
01:58:46,700 --> 01:58:48,070
Go!

1297
02:01:32,820 --> 02:01:34,530
Mumbai city is yours.

1298
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:43,780
Go rule.

1299
02:01:44,450 --> 02:01:45,700
Yes, Bhau.

1300
02:01:46,780 --> 02:01:48,070
Thank you.
