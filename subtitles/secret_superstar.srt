1
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:57,707
Chest - 54.

2
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,165
Chest - 19 C.

3
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,207
Grow up.

4
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,665
Chest - 19.

5
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,874
Chest - 48.

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,540
- Chest - 51
- Chest - 52

7
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,457
Sing a song starting with 'M'.

8
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,499
Let's sing "My Girl".

9
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,290
- Hey, Insia has got her guitar out.
- Quiet, everyone.

10
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,249
- Quiet...
- quiet.

11
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:12,832
"Secretly, quietly and with care,"

12
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:16,249
"patiently I picked a twig here,
and a straw there,"

13
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:24,332
"and built myself a dream."

14
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:32,832
"With a stitch here and a knit there,
collecting little patches,"

15
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:40,249
"I quilted myself a dream."

16
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:49,290
"I quilted myself a dream."

17
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:53,624
"O dream, my dream,"

18
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,957
"come alive, my dream."

19
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:01,832
"O dream, my dream,"

20
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,124
"come alive, my dream."

21
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,540
Insia, is this a new song?

22
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,832
It's really nice. Have you written it?

23
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,540
What are you doing here?

24
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,749
I have an announcement.

25
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,290
These are pamphlets of an inter school contest.

26
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,499
There's solo dancing,
group dancing, beauty contest,

27
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,207
and singing, too.

28
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:50,290
In every category, the winner gets a laptop

29
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,374
and one year of free internet!

30
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,874
Show me!

31
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,999
And one more thing,
all the best for the 1 0th grade.

32
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,499
Same to you.

33
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,165
I missed you so much.

34
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,457
Give it to me.

35
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,290
You know, on the show Singing Idol,

36
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,957
a little boy was auditioning.

37
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:56,749
Shakti Kumaarr was so hard on him...
it was terrible!

38
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,790
What happened to your eye?

39
00:05:59,208 --> 00:05:59,999
It's nothing.

40
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:04,207
I opened the kitchen cabinet,
and the door hit my eye.

41
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,374
You're right.

42
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,040
I'm really stupid.

43
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,374
So, I was saying,

44
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:13,915
Shakti Kumaarr was so mean
that the poor kid broke down.

45
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,999
I am right.

46
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,582
You really are stupid.

47
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,749
Insu!

48
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,707
Get away!

49
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,499
Be quiet.

50
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,749
Did you get me a gift?

51
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,290
Are you nuts?

52
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,665
Two chocolates?

53
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,457
No.

54
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,457
One chocolate?

55
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:16,874
Shut up.

56
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:17,874
Not even one?

57
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,999
- No!
- Insia!

58
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,499
Have you no manners?

59
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,290
Haven't greeted me?

60
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,707
May peace be on you, grand-aunt.

61
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:28,207
May peace be on you, too.

62
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,665
Why didn't you get me a gift?

63
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,749
Get out of here!

64
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:31,957
Gift... gift. Go!

65
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:35,207
Why are you screaming at my Guddu?

66
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:39,124
- Guddu...
- Up to no good, this mother and daughter!

67
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,707
This one... no this one...

68
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,457
Good job.

69
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,540
So, judges, what's your verdict?

70
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,832
Monali-ji?

71
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,249
Aw, you're so cute.

72
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,624
- 1 0 points just for cuteness.
- Wow, 1 0 points!

73
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:11,749
What?

74
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:12,832
Cuteness?

75
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,374
Are we judging cuteness?

76
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,124
This is a singing show, Monali.

77
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:16,999
Singing.

78
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,374
I know my job. I'm a judge, too.

79
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,540
You're a rubbish judge.

80
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,415
He can't sing to save his life.

81
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,082
Kiddo, you're an insult to talent!

82
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,624
You're an insult to talent!

83
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,540
How dare you!

84
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,749
What do you know about talent?

85
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:31,915
Don't interrupt.

86
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,165
What are you looking at?

87
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,374
Now, get out!

88
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,165
Get out!

89
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,332
"Friends, Shakti-ji is well known
for his anger."

90
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,790
"And now it is rumored
that his wife left him last month."

91
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:51,415
"Obviously he's under stress and frustrated."

92
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,040
"Well, his marriage seems to be over,"

93
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,957
"after the break our astrologer will predict,"

94
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,249
"whether this year
Salman will finally get married."

95
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,832
Oh, I completely forgot,

96
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,165
Glamour Awards is on TV tonight.

97
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,999
I remembered.

98
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,624
Who do you think will win Best Singer?

99
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,207
I don't know. It's a tough one.

100
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,415
Best Music Composer?

101
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,624
Anyone... but Shakti Kumaarr.

102
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,290
He has never won an award in any case.

103
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,082
Earlier, he made such good songs.

104
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,165
But nowadays, when I listen to his songs,

105
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,165
it feels like he has remixed
some really nice song,

106
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,790
and that nice song never got made.

107
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,249
Mom... potty.

108
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,624
Wait for sometime.

109
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,457
Come.

110
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,499
"Let's move to the next award,
which is the 'Best Female Playback Singer'."

111
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,665
"And the nominees for this award are:"

112
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:54,790
"Monali Thakur..."

113
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,332
Sudha Venkat will definitely win.

114
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,832
No, Monali Thakur.

115
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,415
- Bet?
- Bet!

116
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,207
Done.

117
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,415
If I win, I can ask for anything.

118
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,707
Okay.

119
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,082
Mom, I'm done.

120
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,790
He's done.

121
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:13,082
I am coming. Push some more.
There maybe some left.

122
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,415
"Friends!"

123
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,499
"I'm tired of receiving awards."

124
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,124
"I'm tired."

125
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,582
He'll blabber on now.

126
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,832
"So, this time
I called Glamour Awards and said,"

127
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,457
"Glamour Award,
this year Shakti won't receive the award,

128
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,499
"he'll give it."

129
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,665
Mom!

130
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,499
- Yes?
- I'm done.

131
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:49,124
"So, here I am to give the award
for the Best Singer..."

132
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,999
"female."

133
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,290
"And the award goes to..."

134
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,832
"Oh!"

135
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,290
"To my protégé, whom I launched."

136
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,665
"Monali Thakur."

137
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:04,749
"Come, Mona. Come."

138
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:05,957
"Come, babes."

139
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,207
Wow!

140
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,749
What can I say!

141
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,999
This award means a lot to me.

142
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,957
Actually, it means the world to me.

143
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,540
Thank you so much to the jury,
to all my fans...

144
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,165
and to Glamour Magazine!

145
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,457
Keep loving me this way
and I'll keep singing such lovely songs.

146
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,874
Thank you so much.

147
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,915
Babes, you're singing quite well nowadays.

148
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,582
"Keep it up. I like it."

149
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,124
"Thank you."

150
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,624
"But, you've been only screaming
at little children nowadays."

151
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,832
"Why don't you write some songs?"

152
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,290
"Who are you to tell me what to do?"

153
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,999
"I've won the award, haven't I?"

154
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,832
"I think I've earned the right to speak."

155
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,082
"Why are you giving a speech?"

156
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,582
"Have you won an award?"

157
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,165
"You used to sing jingles for toothpaste ads,

158
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,707
"that's where I picked you up from.
Don't forget!"

159
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,915
They behave so badly. No shame.

160
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,999
By the way, I won the bet.

161
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,332
Yes.

162
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,374
So, what do you want?

163
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,082
There's an inter-school singing competition.

164
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,665
Can I participate?

165
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,332
Okay. But, don't tell your father.

166
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,707
But, if I get selected for the finals
I will have to go to Mumbai.

167
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,207
No, Insu. Then let it go.

168
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,665
Your father threatens
to break the guitar at every instance!

169
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,082
He'll never allow it.

170
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,290
You said I could ask for anything.

171
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,374
Insu, I said you could ask anything of me.

172
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,832
Not from life.

173
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,749
Listen.

174
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,249
I have an idea.

175
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:49,999
- What?
- Come here.

176
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,874
Straighten your face.

177
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,540
Tell me.

178
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,749
- Your father will return late tonight.
- So?

179
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,999
He'll be tired and hungry.

180
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:01,374
Ask him this question when he's eating.

181
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,749
He may agree.

182
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,332
Good idea, mom.

183
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,040
Which song should I sing?

184
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,165
Song...

185
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,665
Do you know what the first prize is?

186
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,957
A laptop and a year of free internet.

187
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,207
So, think of a good song.

188
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,874
Sing any song.

189
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,499
You'll win for sure.

190
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,624
You're my favourite singer.

191
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,499
Even better than Monali Thakur.

192
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,165
Really.

193
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,499
Go to sleep.

194
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,749
Salam, father.

195
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,415
Can I expect to get some water in this house?

196
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,957
Yes, father.

197
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,624
How was your trip?

198
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,207
It was good, father.

199
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,124
Did you learn anything
or did you just waste your time?

200
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,457
No, father. It was good.

201
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,582
How are you?

202
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,082
Salam.

203
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,124
Father, there's this...

204
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,165
Father, there is a...

205
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,374
There's less salt.

206
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,457
What?

207
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,915
Come here.

208
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,332
Just coming.

209
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,165
Sorry!

210
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,290
Should I fill my stomach with your apology?

211
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:35,832
Can a man not expect a decent meal
after working 1 7 hours?

212
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,124
Father...

213
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,290
Najma... have you packed my bag?

214
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,707
Bag?

215
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:50,874
Are you Najma?

216
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,457
Sorry, father.

217
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,332
You are leaving day after, right?

218
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,707
What did I say? When was I leaving?

219
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,749
On the 3rd. What's the date today?

220
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,332
Today is the 2nd.

221
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,207
What does that make tomorrow?

222
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,207
Sorry.

223
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,999
You forget the salt. You forget to pack.

224
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,749
Is there anything you remember?

225
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,207
I'm fed up of you.

226
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,332
Sorry, I...

227
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:32,249
Say sorry once more,
and it won't be the plate, it'll be you.

228
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,582
You go inside.

229
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,290
Mom, I think you should leave father.

230
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,332
He's not the right husband for you.

231
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,999
Then who is?

232
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,665
Shah Rukh Khan?

233
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,790
Mom, why don't you get it?

234
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,082
I'm not joking.

235
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,457
Insu, I've told you a million times.

236
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,624
Who will take care of us?

237
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,290
There's your school fees...

238
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,832
We can't be dependent on your grandfather.

239
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,040
Why grandfather?

240
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,874
Mom, trust me. I'll take care of us.

241
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:55,832
Really?

242
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,374
What's your plan, madam?

243
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,082
Just say yes, mom.

244
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:03,374
Tell me, isn't the destination decided first
and then the route later?

245
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,874
Did the chicken come first or the egg?

246
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,082
What?

247
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,665
Did the chicken come first or the egg?

248
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,082
It depends on the situation.

249
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:13,957
Meaning?

250
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:17,457
Meaning, if you want to eat chicken,
the egg comes first,

251
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,082
it hatches into a chicken, which you cook.

252
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,040
But, if you want to eat an omelette,
the chicken comes first,

253
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,249
it lays the egg,
which you make into an omelette.

254
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,915
Oh God, Insu!
You have the answer to every question.

255
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,665
No, mom.

256
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,749
But, we'll find it, won't we?

257
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,124
Insu, it's impossible to argue with you.

258
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,707
Then, don't.

259
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:38,915
Promise me.

260
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,249
What?

261
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,165
If I make a good plan, you'll leave father.

262
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,582
Insu...

263
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,707
Don't Insu me. Promise me.

264
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,707
Mom, promise me.

265
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,832
Okay... fine...

266
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,540
Go to sleep now... I promise.

267
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,374
Like a definite promise?

268
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,415
Alright, I promise.

269
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,624
A real promise?

270
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:56,582
Yes!

271
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,249
Bye.

272
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,915
Come on... quick.

273
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,457
Insia.

274
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,457
Insia!

275
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,082
Give me one example of irony.

276
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,707
Did this witch have to ask me
a question right now?

277
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,582
I've just got a tune.
If I answer it'll be lost.

278
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,832
Are you deaf?

279
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,457
Give me one example of irony.

280
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,207
Should I answer or stay with the tune?

281
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,540
Give me your hand.

282
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,332
I said, give me your hand!

283
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,040
Go on, hit me.

284
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,457
Hi!

285
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,707
Chocolate?

286
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,165
Thank you.

287
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,999
You are most welcome.

288
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,707
Guddu, open the door.

289
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,915
How long do you take to open the door?

290
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,290
Sorry... sorry.

291
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,874
Give it to me!

292
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,082
What's this?!

293
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,040
Mom, what's this?!

294
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,665
What?

295
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,207
I have no idea.

296
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,874
Where did it come from, Guddu?

297
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,624
Drama queen!

298
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,040
Mom, how much did it cost?

299
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:10,790
1 000 rupees per kilo.

300
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,165
Your laptop is even
more expensive than mangoes.

301
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,040
Tell me, where did you get so much money?

302
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,957
It doesn't matter.

303
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,707
Last night if I had put salt in the dinner,

304
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,790
then perhaps you would've won this
in the competition.

305
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:24,457
But, I forgot.

306
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,707
Tell me honestly.

307
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:26,915
Did you borrow the money?

308
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,832
I can't accept it. Let's return it.

309
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,415
Are you crazy, Insu?

310
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,999
There are so many things in life,
I have not been able to give you,

311
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,832
and nor will I be able to.

312
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,624
Don't rob me of the joy of seeing you smile.

313
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,790
It comes rarely.

314
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,124
Mom!

315
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:06,374
Yes?

316
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,040
Look, the world is so big,
and our Baroda is so small.

317
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:13,499
Is this Baroda?!

318
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:21,124
"Suddenly my eyes have learnt to dance."

319
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,040
"Suddenly my teeth have learnt to sparkle."

320
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:29,040
"It feels like this heart of mine
has just learnt to laugh."

321
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:32,749
"Laugh from the depths of my soul."

322
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:36,915
"Suddenly my hair has learnt to bounce."

323
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,790
"Suddenly my stains have learnt to vanish."

324
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:44,790
"It feels like this heart of mine
has just learnt to laugh."

325
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:48,207
"Laugh from the depths of my soul."

326
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:53,124
"Suddenly the windows have begun to tickle me."

327
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,040
"Suddenly the chairs have begun to tickle me."

328
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:02,915
"Suddenly every little thing
is bringing me joy."

329
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:09,290
"Suddenly the curries have begun to tickle me."

330
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,874
"Suddenly the flatbreads
have begun to tickle me."

331
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:18,957
"Suddenly every little thing
is bringing me joy."

332
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:39,332
- Who is this?
- No idea, mom!

333
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,999
Really?

334
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,624
What's with these dramatics
in the middle of the night?

335
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:29,582
Mom, I too want to upload my videos on YouTube.

336
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:34,749
How wonderful.

337
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:37,707
Upload your videos on YouTube,

338
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:40,040
and send it to your father in Riyadh.

339
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,290
You know what will happen next.

340
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,374
I know, mom.

341
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:47,499
Insu, it's 3 am.

342
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:49,915
Stop dreaming and go to sleep.

343
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,665
How is that possible, mom?

344
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,957
First you tell me to sleep,
then you ask me not to dream?

345
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:57,707
When I sleep won't I end up dreaming.

346
00:26:57,791 --> 00:27:00,249
You tell me, why do we wake up every morning?

347
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:02,290
So that we can realize our dreams.

348
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:04,957
Otherwise, what's the point
of waking up everyday?

349
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,874
Mom, there is no point
to anything without dreams.

350
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,415
Neither to sleep, nor to wake up.

351
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,874
Neither to live, nor to die.

352
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:13,499
Mom, to dream is a basic right!

353
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:15,165
Everyone should be allowed this much.

354
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,249
Insu, how much you talk!

355
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:19,082
Tell me in one line, what do you want?

356
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,582
Tell me, what is your dream?

357
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:21,749
What do I want?

358
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:24,124
Mom, I want the whole world to hear my voice.

359
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:26,790
Not just school, or Baroda, or India.

360
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:29,749
The whole world should know me
as the best singer.

361
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,707
Not just you.

362
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:32,915
That's my dream, too.

363
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:35,290
And I'm sure it'll come true. Go to sleep now.

364
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:37,874
Let it be, mom. It's useless talking to you.

365
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:51,332
Insu.

366
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:54,082
I have an idea.

367
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:55,332
What?

368
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,207
What are you doing?

369
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:03,415
Wait.

370
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:05,124
Here.

371
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:06,415
What's this?

372
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,707
An idea.

373
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:10,124
- It's not an idea, it's a burqa.
- Exactly!

374
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:11,540
What do you mean?

375
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:13,415
- I should wear this and make videos?
- Yes.

376
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:15,957
You want the entire world to hear you, right?

377
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:17,874
Why do they have to see your face?

378
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:19,165
They should hear you.

379
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,290
It does matter, mom. How absurd?

380
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:22,374
It's a horrible idea.

381
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:24,165
I want to be famous
and you tell me to hide my face?

382
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,707
No. You don't understand.

383
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:27,082
Listen to me.

384
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,624
I'm not telling you to change your destination.

385
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,165
Just change your route.

386
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,582
You should allow that much.

387
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:35,790
No, mom.

388
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:38,499
It's a stupid idea. It'll never work.

389
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:49,290
To all those watching,

390
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:51,290
this is my first YouTube video.

391
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:53,249
My name is...

392
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,499
I can't tell you all my name.

393
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:01,124
But if you like this video please click 'like'.

394
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:21,624
"Can someone tell me, where am I?"

395
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:28,207
"Can someone tell me, where I stand?"

396
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:34,957
"Have I chosen the correct path?"

397
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:41,790
"Should I embark on this journey?"

398
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:49,040
"I fear my dreams, will they destroy me?"

399
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:55,499
"I fear those close to me,
will they betray me?"

400
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,582
"Am I the moon? Or the shadows in it?"

401
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:02,915
"Am I the ashes? Or the raging fire?"

402
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,290
"Am I the drop? Or the mighty wave?"

403
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:13,915
"Do I bring tranquility?
Or do I unleash a storm?"

404
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:34,832
"Can someone tell me, who am I?"

405
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:41,582
"Do I have a purpose?
A reason to be? Who am I?"

406
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:48,332
"Do I believe in myself?"

407
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:55,499
"Does my existence even matter?"

408
00:30:56,291 --> 00:31:02,415
"Whose shoulder do I cry on, should I falter?"

409
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:09,665
"Who will guide me, should I lose my way?"

410
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,999
"Am I the moon? Or the shadows in it?"

411
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:16,249
"Am I the ashes? Or the raging fire?"

412
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,582
"Am I the drop? Or the mighty wave?"

413
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:26,707
"Do I bring tranquility?
Or do I unleash a storm?"

414
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:56,290
"Should I live my truth? Or remain silent?"

415
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:59,582
"Should I bear my soul? Or break my heart?"

416
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:02,874
"Should I cross all boundaries?
Or rein myself in?"

417
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:06,165
"Should I keep fighting? Or just give up?"

418
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,624
"Am I the moon? Or the shadows in it?"

419
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:12,999
"Am I the ashes? Or the raging fire?"

420
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:16,332
"Am I the drop? Or the mighty wave?"

421
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:22,832
"Do I bring tranquility?
Or do I unleash a storm?"

422
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:39,832
"Who am I?"

423
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,790
I knew it was a stupid idea.

424
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:08,040
What's the time, Insia?

425
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:09,457
Sorry, Miss.

426
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:11,290
Your mother put me in a fix.

427
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:14,624
I already have so many children.
I shouldn't have taken you in.

428
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:17,624
Everyone knows that
I don't take more than 45 children.

429
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,249
Sorry, Miss. It won't happen again.

430
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,207
Come, now.

431
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,957
Find a place.

432
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:26,624
This is broader. This is narrower.

433
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:28,749
You know why? I explained that.

434
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,332
1 1 73K.

435
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:32,874
And 1 973K.

436
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:34,832
Okay.

437
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:46,124
Miss, there's no other place to sit.

438
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:06,332
What is it?

439
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:08,249
You came late to class.

440
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:11,082
So, if you want any notes,
I can share them with you.

441
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:12,290
Okay.

442
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:16,624
Hey, Insia.

443
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:22,415
I added you on Facebook. You didn't respond.

444
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:25,165
- Are we friends?
- Aren't we?

445
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,290
Chintan.

446
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,832
Tell me.

447
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:40,874
Do you have the trigonometry sums solved?

448
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,207
Yes, I do.

449
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:44,874
You copy them. I'll wait outside your house.

450
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:46,290
Are you a doorman?

451
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:47,290
No.

452
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:49,457
You can come inside too.

453
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:50,832
Okay.

454
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:55,249
Insu.

455
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,249
Lay the table.

456
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:03,874
Mom!

457
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:05,832
Mom.

458
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:07,332
Mom.

459
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:09,207
- Insu.
- Come here.

460
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:10,707
Calm down.

461
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:11,915
Look, mom.

462
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,624
This is your video!

463
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:16,082
Yes, and guess how many people have watched it?

464
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:17,874
1 1,470 people!

465
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:18,874
Seriously?

466
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:21,749
I have never even met
so many people in my life.

467
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,249
All thanks to this laptop.

468
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:24,957
Your idea worked, mom.

469
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:26,124
I told you, didn't I?

470
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:28,374
Now I'll be a superstar, too!

471
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:32,415
Insu, listen...

472
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:34,749
everyone knows a superstar.

473
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:36,540
You'll have to remain a secret.

474
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:40,499
Or your father will throw us
out of the house along with this laptop.

475
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:41,915
Nothing will happen, mom.

476
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,207
Insu.

477
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:46,707
I mean it. Your father shouldn't get to know.

478
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:48,082
How will father know?

479
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,540
Father doesn't watch YouTube.

480
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:50,874
Promise. Nothing will happen.

481
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:55,249
Alright.

482
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:57,999
Before your grand-aunt yells,
I'll serve dinner.

483
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,249
Listen.

484
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:01,249
What is it now, mom?

485
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:02,832
Father will be back tomorrow.

486
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:05,790
He's going to be home all day.
Please keep this thing shut.

487
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:08,415
Mom, when will father get that job in Riyadh?

488
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:10,999
Once he does he's out of our lives
for 1 1 months, right?

489
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:14,374
Yes, and during Ramadan
he'll be in the house 24-hours.

490
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,374
Only one month, right? We'll bear with it.

491
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:19,082
It's not a bad deal.

492
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:23,957
Hey, what's your name?

493
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,290
You are so talented.

494
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:27,332
Your videos are damn good.

495
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:29,665
Do you have a Twitter account
or a Facebook page?

496
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:33,374
So sad! You can't show your face?

497
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:36,457
How does it matter
if she shows her face or not?

498
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:38,374
What an amazing voice this child has!

499
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:42,832
Otherwise videos nowadays are
short on both talent and clothes.

500
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:45,874
You have such an amazing voice.

501
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,124
When do we get to see your next video?

502
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:49,707
Thank you.

503
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:51,207
You are not sleepy either?

504
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:52,957
It's 3 am.

505
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:56,624
I'm in New York. It's 5.30 in the evening here.

506
00:37:56,916 --> 00:37:58,249
Mom.

507
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,999
Mom.

508
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,707
Mom, people in New York are
watching my video, too.

509
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:04,082
Mom.

510
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,499
Salam.

511
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,665
- All well?
- Yes.

512
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,874
- How's Guddu?
- He's fine.

513
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:36,165
What's this? Where did it come from?

514
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:37,707
Brother sent it.

515
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:41,415
No one was using it at his house.

516
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:44,832
Has your brother ever sent anything new?

517
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:49,582
He likes dumping his trash here.

518
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:04,999
Aunt.

519
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:07,290
Shah Rukh Khan's film is showing.

520
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:08,165
Do you want to see it?

521
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:13,624
Since your uncle passed away,
I haven't gone to the theatre.

522
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:14,665
Shall we go, then?

523
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:15,957
That's a great idea.

524
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:18,374
Insu too, has been wanting to watch a film.

525
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:20,249
Doesn't Insia have assignments to do?

526
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:22,582
Aren't the 1 0th grade exams important?

527
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,790
Films, TV, guitar... stop everything this year.

528
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:28,999
And now this laptop... what use is it?

529
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:30,582
Come here.

530
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:35,040
It is very difficult to find a match
for an illiterate, uneducated girl.

531
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:38,207
I got stuck. Not everyone will.

532
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:48,040
Sorry.

533
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,249
Be careful.

534
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:24,457
Hello, everyone.

535
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:26,540
Thank you for your likes and comments.

536
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:28,332
Here's my second video.

537
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,040
This song is for my mom.

538
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:41,874
"She's a little cute, and a little stern too."

539
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:50,749
"She's a little cool,
and a little old school too."

540
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:59,582
"She's like a sweet, chilled juice,
on a hot summer day."

541
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:09,040
"She's like a warm blanket,
on a freezing winter night."

542
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:13,540
"My dearest mom."

543
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:18,165
"She's my dearest... my mom."

544
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:22,582
"My dearest mom."

545
00:41:22,791 --> 00:41:28,332
"She's my dearest... my mom."

546
00:41:57,791 --> 00:42:00,040
"When I'm troubled,"

547
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:02,040
"she's all tears."

548
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,540
"In my joy, too,"

549
00:42:04,541 --> 00:42:06,790
"her tears wet her scarf."

550
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:09,165
"With every tear drop,"

551
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:11,499
"she weaves blessings."

552
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:16,915
"Will someone tell me, are all moms like this?"

553
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:28,332
"Sometimes she's practical,
and sometimes she's emotional."

554
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:37,290
"Her one smile, dispels all my worries."

555
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:46,499
"She's like a master key,
which opens all the locks to my fortunes."

556
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:55,624
"I've placed in her care,
all my trunks, full of dreams."

557
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:59,874
"My dearest mom."

558
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:04,582
"She's my dearest... my mom."

559
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:09,207
"My dearest, my mom."

560
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:15,165
"She's my dearest... my mom."

561
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:43,415
"My dearest mom."

562
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:48,207
"She's my dearest... my mom."

563
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:52,707
"My dearest, my mom."

564
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:59,457
"She's my dearest... my mom."

565
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,624
Chintan, does ma'am yell at you?

566
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:13,790
Yes.

567
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:16,124
She yells at me more.

568
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:18,832
Hey... shush...

569
00:44:41,291 --> 00:44:43,540
Miss, I'm done.

570
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:45,540
- So fast?
- Yes.

571
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:47,374
Show it to me.

572
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:49,415
Wait a minute, Insia.

573
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,624
What's this?

574
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:54,499
Miss, I'll study better tomorrow,
and take the test again.

575
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:57,665
Get your mom to sign this.

576
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:00,332
Your mom pleaded with me
to take you in this class.

577
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,332
Taking you in was a waste of my time.

578
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:04,957
It wasn't the pleading,

579
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:06,707
it was double the fees that worked on you!

580
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:08,207
Oh, really?

581
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:11,374
Your father is the one paying me 'double fees'.

582
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:14,457
My fees come from his hard earned money.

583
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:18,832
So, get his signature too.

584
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:20,415
I'm so sorry, Miss. I didn't mean...

585
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,957
Go, get the signatures.

586
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:23,082
I'm sorry, ma'am. Please...

587
00:45:23,208 --> 00:45:26,999
Go or I will call your home.
Get the signatures.

588
00:45:30,291 --> 00:45:32,540
Miss, I'm done, too.

589
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:38,207
Insia, what happened?

590
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,790
Sorry.

591
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,665
Hey, this is you, isn't it?

592
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:18,457
What?

593
00:46:18,541 --> 00:46:19,582
What rubbish?

594
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:21,582
And what are you doing here?

595
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:23,457
I've seen all your videos.

596
00:46:23,541 --> 00:46:26,499
I had a feeling it's you.
Because I recognize your voice.

597
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:29,040
Everyone at school watches your videos.

598
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:31,582
Who else knows?

599
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:34,749
I don't think anyone else knows. Only me.

600
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:36,332
Hey, just a minute!

601
00:46:36,416 --> 00:46:39,457
You don't want anyone to know,
that's why you wear a burqa, right?

602
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:40,999
Insu?

603
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:43,040
Chintan, please take this paper and run.

604
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:45,207
And don't tell anyone, please.

605
00:46:45,291 --> 00:46:46,249
Okay. Don't worry.

606
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:48,957
I keep everyone's secrets. I never tell.

607
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:50,915
Thanks, Chintan.

608
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:54,624
By the way, can I tell you one of my secrets?

609
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:55,874
Sure.

610
00:46:58,416 --> 00:46:59,457
I love you.

611
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:00,499
What?

612
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:03,249
Look... not because you are a superstar.

613
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:05,665
God promise. From much earlier. Honestly!

614
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:08,540
You must have felt it too?

615
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,457
You leave. I have to go home.

616
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:12,249
Should I go?

617
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:13,374
Go.

618
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:23,165
- Najma.
- Yes?

619
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,207
Have you taken the newspaper?

620
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:27,290
Newspaper?

621
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:30,582
The newspaper hasn't come today.

622
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:42,207
Be sure to deduct his money.
Today's not a holiday.

623
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:43,499
Yes.

624
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:46,665
"Secret Superstar."

625
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,665
"Anonymous, yet famous."

626
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:55,790
"Who is this mysterious girl
who won't show us her face?"

627
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:58,874
"ls this a marketing strategy?"

628
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:01,582
"If not, who is this person,"

629
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:05,124
"who has taken the Internet by storm
in barely four months?"

630
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,124
"Friends... you must've heard..."

631
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:08,832
Father, look at this dinosaur...

632
00:48:09,708 --> 00:48:11,999
Sorry, father.

633
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:18,499
"Coco Money Singh's song
has got one million views."

634
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:25,290
"But our Secret Superstar
has got thirty million views!"

635
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:26,749
"Not just that,"

636
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:30,582
"her song 'Who am I?'
is trending number one on YouTube."

637
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:35,749
"- And Superstar Mr. Amitabh Bachchan himself
has tweeted about this song."

638
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:40,665
"This afternoon the All India committee
of the Singers' Association,"

639
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:44,582
"has boycotted music composer
Mr. Shakti Kumaarr."

640
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:49,165
"The committee is deeply upset in the way
he yelled at a small child,

641
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:52,332
"on the Singing Idol show."

642
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:58,707
"The situation now is that no singer will sing
for Shakti Kumaarr's new film."

643
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:00,540
- By the way,
- "Now, the producer will have no choice

644
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:01,832
"but to replace him."

645
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:06,415
it's Zahir's daughter's wedding tomorrow.
You have to come, too.

646
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,874
And there's no need to wear a burqa there.

647
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,499
They are very modern. They won't like it.

648
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:14,999
Guddu, you come, too.

649
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:19,790
Hi, ma'am.

650
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,874
I'm in love with you.

651
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:25,874
I haven't seen your face,
but I love your voice.

652
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:27,082
Bye!

653
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:35,624
Babes, I saw your video.

654
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:38,040
Hiding your face, eh?

655
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:41,040
Naughty... naughty!

656
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:45,165
You have a pretty good voice.
Not bad. You have potential.

657
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:48,665
If you want to make your future,
then call Shakti.

658
00:49:48,791 --> 00:49:51,499
- Yuck!
- My number is 98200...

659
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:54,374
Couldn't AR Rahman have emailed instead?

660
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:02,540
Go on.

661
00:50:09,958 --> 00:50:11,290
What happened?

662
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:14,415
Father, we had a science test.

663
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:18,749
The same? 50 percent again?

664
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:21,790
No father, this was just a test
at the extra classes.

665
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,665
I will study harder for the school exams.

666
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:26,874
How much did you score?

667
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:28,915
30

668
00:50:29,166 --> 00:50:30,332
Out of?

669
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,290
1 00

670
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:36,957
Failed?

671
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,332
Yes, father.

672
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:41,999
But, this was a surprise test.

673
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:44,540
I was totally unprepared.

674
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,499
Had I known earlier, I would've gone prepared.

675
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:50,582
I need your signature on this.

676
00:51:03,291 --> 00:51:05,832
Father, look how strictly she has assessed it.

677
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,290
Get me your guitar.

678
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:19,124
What?

679
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:22,332
Father, I'm sorry.

680
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:25,999
I'll study well for the school exams.
I will score 70 percent.

681
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,124
70 percent? You can't even pass!

682
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:30,749
I said, bring me your guitar.

683
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:32,165
Sorry, father.

684
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:37,249
Don't make me ask you again.

685
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:12,707
Don't restring it till I tell you to.

686
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:17,332
How is this connected to my exams?

687
00:52:17,416 --> 00:52:18,874
Even if I don't play I could still fail!

688
00:52:18,916 --> 00:52:21,040
Insu! ls this any way to talk to your father?

689
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:22,582
- Apologise.
- What did you say?

690
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:23,749
Sorry.

691
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,165
She's just a child. Let her go.

692
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:29,832
Are you doing me a favour by apologizing?

693
00:52:31,291 --> 00:52:32,624
Sorry.

694
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,124
Insu.

695
00:52:58,333 --> 00:53:00,749
Why are you irritating me, Chintan? Go away.

696
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:02,540
Sorry.

697
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,957
Knock, knock.

698
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:14,457
Say 'Who's there'.

699
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:16,707
I have a great 'knock, knock' joke.

700
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:18,874
Why are you bugging me, Chintan?

701
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:27,957
"Hi, Insia!"

702
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:30,832
"I see you're in a bad mood."

703
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:34,332
"I'm a lollipop. Why don't you eat me?"

704
00:53:35,625 --> 00:53:38,624
Are you a pet dog?
Why do you keep following me?

705
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:40,790
Why are you stuck to me? What's your problem?

706
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:42,290
I've told you off four times since morning.

707
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:45,707
But, you don't understand.
Because you have no self-respect, isn't it?

708
00:53:45,916 --> 00:53:47,332
I'm sorry.

709
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:48,999
Sorry.

710
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:50,790
Extremely sorry.

711
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:11,499
You're looking like a star.

712
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,624
Come on... hurry up.

713
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,082
How much longer?

714
00:54:15,166 --> 00:54:17,249
I'm coming. Just a minute longer.

715
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,874
Insu.

716
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:21,957
Eat your food.

717
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:23,249
And serve grand-aunt, too.

718
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:24,749
We'll be late.

719
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:27,165
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

720
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:31,124
Will you come like this?

721
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:33,415
What is it?

722
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,124
Your neck is looking bare.

723
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:38,207
Wear that gold necklace
your father gave you, the cheap one.

724
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:40,290
Otherwise, what will people think?

725
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:43,749
That this engineer husband
can't even buy his wife a necklace?

726
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:46,165
I don't know where I've kept it.

727
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:48,290
If I start looking for it now,
it'll get very late.

728
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:49,124
Let's go.

729
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:52,790
It's not like we live in a palace!
It's a small house.

730
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:54,249
Look for it. I'll wait.

731
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,707
I remember now.

732
00:54:56,291 --> 00:54:58,624
It's in the bank locker.

733
00:55:00,666 --> 00:55:02,540
Have you taken sleeping pills?

734
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:05,249
We gave up the locker four months ago.

735
00:55:05,375 --> 00:55:06,540
Don't waste time.

736
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:07,665
Go... find it.

737
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:10,624
Actually, I forgot to tell you.

738
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:12,832
I left it at my brother's house.

739
00:55:12,916 --> 00:55:15,249
You had worn it on Eid.
We haven't met your brother since.

740
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:16,749
Don't bullshit me!

741
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:18,249
Go inside.

742
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:20,540
I said find it. That's it!

743
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:21,957
Nonsense!

744
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:24,374
Come, I'll help you find it.

745
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,124
I'm waiting here.

746
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:34,290
Mom, you sold the necklace to buy the laptop?

747
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:37,124
What else could I do?
There was nothing else to sell.

748
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:40,165
Why did you sell the gold necklace?

749
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:42,957
What will we tell father now?

750
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:44,374
I don't know, Insu.

751
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:49,165
What should we do?

752
00:55:49,791 --> 00:55:51,999
I'll say that I've kept it somewhere.
I can't find it.

753
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:53,332
Will father believe you?

754
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:54,915
I don't know, Insu.

755
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:58,165
I don't know what to say.

756
00:55:59,208 --> 00:56:01,749
I'll have to say something.
There's no other way out.

757
00:56:01,833 --> 00:56:03,999
I'll say I've misplaced it.

758
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:08,165
Let's try that.

759
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:22,832
I'm looking for it.

760
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:23,707
I'll find it.

761
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:26,540
Insu, look there in that box.

762
00:56:26,625 --> 00:56:28,290
I must've kept it there.

763
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:32,165
Look in that box below.

764
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:51,957
Can't find it.

765
00:56:52,833 --> 00:56:55,790
Sell the house next without asking me.

766
00:57:05,666 --> 00:57:08,082
- Father, listen...
- Did I speak to you?

767
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,999
- Father, but...
- Did I speak to you?

768
00:57:14,916 --> 00:57:17,124
I was going to tell you.

769
00:57:17,458 --> 00:57:18,665
Father... listen...

770
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,374
Father, I had insisted...

771
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:22,290
Stand here.

772
00:57:22,666 --> 00:57:23,624
Father, listen to me.

773
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:25,290
I'll definitely sell the laptop tomorrow.

774
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:26,999
And we'll buy a similar necklace.

775
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:28,915
Father, it's my fault, not hers.

776
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,707
Insia, take Guddu and go inside.

777
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:33,249
I'm telling you the truth.
Mom had nothing to do with this.

778
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:35,540
Didn't you hear me? Take Guddu and go inside.

779
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:37,415
Father, it's not her fault.

780
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,457
I'm responsible for this.

781
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:42,332
Do you want your brother to see this?

782
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:43,749
Do you?

783
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:47,374
You should definitely be seeing this
because it's all your fault.

784
00:57:47,458 --> 00:57:50,332
She really had nothing to do with this.

785
00:57:50,541 --> 00:57:51,874
Father...

786
00:57:59,416 --> 00:58:02,957
Insu, take Guddu and go inside.

787
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:07,124
Go. Go inside.

788
00:58:11,958 --> 00:58:13,415
Tell me, what else you've sold.

789
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,665
Don't tell me later, you sold this
and that and you forgot to tell me.

790
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,374
What are you looking down for?

791
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:21,790
Look at me. I'm asking you something.

792
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:23,124
Yes? I'm asking you.

793
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,124
Answer me.

794
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:25,082
Tell me.

795
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:26,665
Who am I? Am I a dog?

796
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:27,624
Am I your servant?

797
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:30,332
Put a leash around my neck and tie me outside.

798
00:58:30,416 --> 00:58:31,957
Is this what I'm worth?

799
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:35,499
Who do you think I am?

800
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:40,165
Will you say something? Or have you gone mute?

801
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:42,832
Mistake? How? Did it happen on its own?

802
00:58:42,916 --> 00:58:44,582
You must've planned it.

803
00:58:45,416 --> 00:58:46,624
So you didn't plan it?

804
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:48,290
Was it involuntary?

805
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,915
Father, stop it, please.

806
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,165
I don't want the laptop. You can sell it.

807
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:59,832
I'm admitting that it's my fault.

808
00:58:59,916 --> 00:59:02,624
Ah. The laptop. Where's it?

809
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,874
Najma.

810
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:05,165
Go, get the laptop.

811
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,374
Laptop.

812
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,832
Quickly.

813
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:36,957
Throw it out.

814
00:59:39,083 --> 00:59:40,457
Why are you looking at her?

815
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:42,999
And you are the one who wanted it.

816
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:45,540
So, you should throw it out.

817
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:49,165
You are angry, right?
Because you insulted me in front of everyone?

818
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:52,415
You are the one who should be angry.

819
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,749
I'm sorry.

820
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:56,582
Actually that was my trick.

821
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:57,707
Trick?

822
01:01:58,583 --> 01:02:01,165
Yes, I do the same thing with my mummy.

823
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:05,207
When she's in a bad mood,
I try to cheer her up.

824
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:06,832
Instead, she yells at me.

825
01:02:06,916 --> 01:02:10,457
And when she does that, she releases her anger.

826
01:02:10,541 --> 01:02:11,999
Then she's back to normal.

827
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:14,832
So, I thought I should use
the same trick on you.

828
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:19,207
Still... I'm sorry.

829
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:20,290
No problem.

830
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:21,332
It's okay.

831
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,249
Flatbread?

832
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:25,624
No, thanks.

833
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:28,082
It's the best flatbread in the universe.

834
01:02:29,166 --> 01:02:30,624
Then I'll have to eat it.

835
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,832
How's Mr. Bachchan?

836
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:36,707
You both are now friends, right?

837
01:02:36,916 --> 01:02:38,249
You read his tweet?

838
01:02:38,875 --> 01:02:42,207
I read all your tweets.
And the ones by your fans, too.

839
01:02:42,583 --> 01:02:46,582
That music composer,
Shakti Kumaarr has also sent you a tweet.

840
01:02:46,666 --> 01:02:47,957
Call him.

841
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:50,082
You can be a playback singer in his film.

842
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:51,665
I won't call him.

843
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:52,457
Why?

844
01:02:52,541 --> 01:02:53,915
He's not a nice man.

845
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:55,040
Do you know him?

846
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:55,999
No!

847
01:02:56,041 --> 01:02:57,957
Then how do you know that
he's not a nice person?

848
01:02:58,041 --> 01:02:59,499
I've seen it on the news.

849
01:03:01,583 --> 01:03:03,582
And his wife left him, too.

850
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:06,290
So, he must not be a nice man.

851
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:13,874
My mummy left my daddy, too.

852
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:17,665
But, he's not a bad man.

853
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,790
My mummy told me that herself.

854
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,457
I'm sorry, Chintan... I didn't know.

855
01:03:22,541 --> 01:03:23,374
It's okay.

856
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:24,790
It's not your fault.

857
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:27,124
Mummy tells me it's nobody's fault.

858
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:34,832
- Will you do me a favour?
- Sure, tell me.

859
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,999
My laptop broke.

860
01:03:37,416 --> 01:03:39,415
Will you check my email?

861
01:03:39,625 --> 01:03:43,457
And post on Facebook and Twitter that
I won't be uploading videos for sometime.

862
01:03:43,541 --> 01:03:45,540
Some personal problem.

863
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:46,915
Okay.

864
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:49,582
And, do you want to say anything
to Shakti Kumaarr?

865
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:02,957
Insia, what's your password?

866
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:10,540
Give me a pen.

867
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,457
Go... sit!

868
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,999
Okay, students. Settle down.

869
01:04:41,708 --> 01:04:45,499
For the final examinations,
25 marks will be given for the science project.

870
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,957
For the final examinations,
25 marks will be given for the science project.

871
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:51,457
You can choose from volcano, blast furnace...

872
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,249
Chintan.

873
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:08,832
- Chintan!
- Yes?

874
01:05:09,166 --> 01:05:10,457
Your stop.

875
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:11,832
Oh... I see.

876
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:14,040
I'll get off at the next stop.

877
01:05:14,208 --> 01:05:16,207
Next stop... for sure.

878
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:21,415
What's your mom like?

879
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:24,457
Mom is like a child.

880
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:26,582
What do you mean?

881
01:05:26,666 --> 01:05:31,832
You know how children are cute but so naive.

882
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:33,290
Always scared.

883
01:05:33,375 --> 01:05:35,040
And very stupid.

884
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:39,165
You have to always explain
what's right for them, and what's not.

885
01:05:39,291 --> 01:05:41,040
Yet they never get it.

886
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:42,790
Mom is exactly like that.

887
01:05:42,875 --> 01:05:44,374
Absolutely stupid.

888
01:05:44,791 --> 01:05:46,332
How do you know?

889
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:47,957
Know what?

890
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:49,374
About children.

891
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:50,832
Do you have any?

892
01:05:51,666 --> 01:05:53,040
Sorry!

893
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:55,707
Sorry. I'm just joking.

894
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:57,082
Take it easy.

895
01:05:59,583 --> 01:06:03,624
There are two boys. This one beats the other.

896
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:05,540
Then he sees...

897
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:07,207
Salam, father.

898
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:08,165
Salam.

899
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,582
How are you, child?

900
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,749
I'm fine.

901
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:13,040
Guddu, open your mouth quickly.

902
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:15,540
What are we celebrating?

903
01:06:15,666 --> 01:06:17,749
Aunt, I've got that job in Riyadh.

904
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,624
In one of the Sheikh's oil rigs, there.

905
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:22,749
As a senior engineer.

906
01:06:22,875 --> 01:06:24,165
Very good.

907
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:26,374
- Did you hear?
- Yes.

908
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:27,374
Here, have some.

909
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:29,290
That's such good news.

910
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,582
I'll make a thanks-giving prayer tomorrow
at the mausoleum.

911
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:36,415
Why not? And tonight, we'll all eat out.

912
01:06:37,958 --> 01:06:39,290
You come too.

913
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:40,499
Okay, father.

914
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:41,582
Here, take.

915
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:50,999
You've grown up so much.

916
01:06:51,791 --> 01:06:54,874
In these last few months, enjoy your freedom.

917
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,582
Then you'll have to start a new life
in a new country. Isn't it?

918
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:05,665
Did you know, Zahir's friend lives there.

919
01:07:06,166 --> 01:07:09,582
He's the vice president of the company
I'll be working for.

920
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:12,832
He has a son. Razzaq.

921
01:07:12,916 --> 01:07:16,457
He has a travel agency.
He also has a license for Hajj tours.

922
01:07:16,708 --> 01:07:19,290
He's a good boy. You will like him.

923
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,290
Look. He has also sent some photographs.

924
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:31,749
You knew all along, didn't you?

925
01:07:31,791 --> 01:07:33,165
That if father got this job,

926
01:07:33,166 --> 01:07:35,665
we'll all have to move with him
to Saudi Arabia.

927
01:07:37,916 --> 01:07:40,707
I didn't think he'd get the job, Insu.

928
01:07:41,416 --> 01:07:43,874
Forget it, mom. I don't want to talk to you.

929
01:07:45,083 --> 01:07:47,249
- At least listen to me...
- Mom, please.

930
01:07:49,625 --> 01:07:53,207
Insu, everything will be okay.

931
01:07:53,791 --> 01:07:54,957
What'll be okay?

932
01:07:55,041 --> 01:07:56,457
How?

933
01:07:58,416 --> 01:07:59,957
Mom, I'm telling you let's run away.

934
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:01,707
Where will we go, Insu?

935
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:03,290
How does it matter?

936
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:05,665
Anyway, in this house, no one cares about us.

937
01:08:05,875 --> 01:08:08,749
He just cares about Guddu, doesn't he?
We'll leave Guddu behind.

938
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:10,207
What rubbish, Insu!

939
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:11,457
If we leave Guddu here,

940
01:08:11,541 --> 01:08:13,290
he will grow up to be exactly like his father.

941
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:15,582
So what's the point of our lives?

942
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:18,249
That we make Guddu two percent better than him

943
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:19,790
What about our lives?

944
01:08:19,875 --> 01:08:23,874
Insu, some things are beyond our control.

945
01:08:24,041 --> 01:08:25,499
Wrong, mom. Wrong!

946
01:08:25,666 --> 01:08:27,582
Everything is in our control.

947
01:08:27,666 --> 01:08:29,499
There's nothing that we can't do.

948
01:08:30,875 --> 01:08:33,582
I'm telling you, mom,
I'm not going to Saudi Arabia.

949
01:08:33,791 --> 01:08:34,832
I'll run away.

950
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,749
And you shouldn't go either.

951
01:08:38,166 --> 01:08:39,832
Mom, I'll plan something.

952
01:08:39,916 --> 01:08:41,707
- Insu...
- Insu... Insu... Insu!

953
01:08:41,791 --> 01:08:44,249
It's useless talking to you.

954
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:10,999
"Shakti Kumaarr's life has taken a new twist."

955
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:14,290
"The Mumbai Family Court
has ruled against him."

956
01:09:14,375 --> 01:09:16,415
"And his wife has won the case."

957
01:09:16,583 --> 01:09:21,082
"His wife's lawyer, Sheena Sabavala,
has proved in court,"

958
01:09:21,166 --> 01:09:27,499
"that he has not one, not two,
but three affairs!"

959
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:30,624
"And that too, simultaneously!
Here's what Shakti Kumaarr had to say."

960
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:32,499
"Sir, you lost the case. How do you feel?"

961
01:09:32,541 --> 01:09:33,999
"Bullshit. It's all rubbish."

962
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:38,332
"My wife's lawyer, that b****,
Sheena Sabavala has lied in court."

963
01:09:38,416 --> 01:09:40,082
"I will appeal to the Supreme court."

964
01:09:40,166 --> 01:09:42,457
"But are the rumours about your affairs true?"

965
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,040
- "Shut up, you B****!"
- "Sir, please, sir."

966
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:48,540
"Now, let's meet the enemy of such men,
Sheena Sabavala."

967
01:09:48,625 --> 01:09:51,457
"Madam, tell us about Shakti Kumaarr's case."

968
01:09:51,666 --> 01:09:55,082
"Shakti Kumaarr is an ill-mannered
and disgusting man."

969
01:09:55,166 --> 01:09:57,499
"I'm very happy with the court's decision."

970
01:09:57,583 --> 01:10:00,374
"It's important to teach a lesson
to men like Shakti."

971
01:10:00,541 --> 01:10:02,249
"If I'm not mistaken,

972
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:07,957
this is Advocate Sheena
Sabavala's 1 1th victory this year."

973
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:14,290
"Which means, she has ruined the lives
of 1 1 men in this one year alone."

974
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:19,165
"Sheena Sabavala has a perfect track
record in matrimonial matters."

975
01:10:19,166 --> 01:10:22,290
"Whether she's up against a music composer
or a mafia don,"

976
01:10:22,291 --> 01:10:24,665
"Sheena Sabavala is going to win!"

977
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:54,374
Chintan.

978
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:55,415
Come.

979
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:58,540
I have some work. You carry on.

980
01:10:58,833 --> 01:10:59,999
Okay.

981
01:11:06,833 --> 01:11:07,624
Number?

982
01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:09,624
I've saved it. It's in 'contacts'.

983
01:11:09,708 --> 01:11:12,415
- But... there's a problem.
- What's the problem?

984
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:15,124
I recharge the phone with my allowance.

985
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:17,832
There's no money left on the phone,
and I'm broke.

986
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:19,124
So, I can't call?

987
01:11:19,166 --> 01:11:21,624
- No. You can give him a missed call.
- A missed call?

988
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:23,040
Why will he call me back?

989
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:24,624
He will. Give it a try.

990
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:26,374
How do you know he will call back?

991
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,124
I have my fingers crossed!

992
01:11:54,375 --> 01:11:55,999
Try once more, please.

993
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:04,665
I'm sorry.

994
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:06,582
Tomorrow I'll take an advance on my allowance.

995
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:08,165
It's okay. Forget it.

996
01:12:11,083 --> 01:12:12,707
Chintan, go home.

997
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:14,790
Don't irritate me. I want to be alone.

998
01:12:14,916 --> 01:12:16,540
I'm headed to your building.

999
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:18,207
My friend stays there.

1000
01:12:18,291 --> 01:12:19,707
Which friend?

1001
01:12:20,708 --> 01:12:21,999
Er... Jignesh.

1002
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:23,540
There's no Jignesh in my building.

1003
01:12:23,625 --> 01:12:24,874
Oh, sorry.

1004
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:29,249
I thought every building in Baroda
would have at least one Jignesh.

1005
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:32,040
Chintan, please don't try
your tricks on me again.

1006
01:12:32,125 --> 01:12:32,999
Go home.

1007
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:33,999
Sorry.

1008
01:12:46,916 --> 01:12:48,290
Insia... Insu...

1009
01:12:48,416 --> 01:12:50,374
the call has come. Come quick!

1010
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:56,874
Hello. Shakti sir.

1011
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:58,415
Sir, this is Insia.

1012
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,957
Insia Mallik...

1013
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:04,665
My videos are on the internet
- Secret Superstar.

1014
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:06,707
Yes sir, the girl in the burqa.

1015
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:09,290
Sorry, it's my friend's phone.

1016
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,582
There's no money left on his phone, so...

1017
01:13:12,375 --> 01:13:14,040
Sir, Baroda.

1018
01:13:14,708 --> 01:13:15,665
Today?

1019
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:16,790
Not today, sir.

1020
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:17,624
Tomorrow?

1021
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,499
Yes, sir. Tomorrow.

1022
01:13:20,666 --> 01:13:22,749
But sir, I have one condition.

1023
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:27,499
If the recording goes well,
then you have to help me.

1024
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,207
That, I'll tell you tomorrow.

1025
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:32,457
Promise, sir?

1026
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:34,082
A real promise?

1027
01:13:34,791 --> 01:13:36,207
Thank you, sir.

1028
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:40,290
Sir, can I... can you call me
back in two minutes, please?

1029
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,249
Thank you, sir.

1030
01:13:44,791 --> 01:13:48,124
He wants me to go to Mumbai tomorrow,
to record a song.

1031
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:50,040
Chintan, how will I go?

1032
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:52,040
- By aeroplane.
- Yes, I know.

1033
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:55,374
He said he'll book the flight
and send an airport pickup.

1034
01:13:55,916 --> 01:13:58,749
You'll have to skip school tomorrow.

1035
01:13:59,125 --> 01:14:02,665
I'll give you the class notes.
And anyway you don't do your assignments.

1036
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:05,499
By the time school finishes, you get back.

1037
01:14:05,916 --> 01:14:07,374
What if someone sees me?

1038
01:14:07,458 --> 01:14:10,124
You are the 'Secret Superstar'. 'Secret!'

1039
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,249
There's one more problem.

1040
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:17,665
I've never flown in a plane.

1041
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:19,790
Don't worry.

1042
01:14:19,875 --> 01:14:21,999
I'll make a plan by tomorrow.

1043
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:23,832
- Mom, come quickly.
- Wait...

1044
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:25,707
- Bye, Insu.
- Wait for two minutes.

1045
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:27,082
Hang on.

1046
01:14:27,416 --> 01:14:29,249
Your lunch box.

1047
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:33,582
Your mom drops you to the bus.
So, you have to get on it.

1048
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:39,040
Don't stress about the ticket,
I'll get a printout.

1049
01:14:42,041 --> 01:14:43,999
The bus drops us inside the school.

1050
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:47,124
So, you'll have to
make your escape from school.

1051
01:14:47,791 --> 01:14:50,540
As soon as you reach school,
go to the girls toilet.

1052
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:52,165
And, jump out from there.

1053
01:14:57,875 --> 01:14:59,832
- Good morning, Miss.
- Good morning.

1054
01:15:16,208 --> 01:15:18,165
I know an escape route.

1055
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:21,957
I figured in case of a terrorist attack,
I must have an escape plan.

1056
01:15:22,041 --> 01:15:24,665
- Chintan, there's a lock on this!
- Lock?

1057
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:27,957
Now what?

1058
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:29,832
I'll think of something.

1059
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,415
I'll be late for the flight.

1060
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:33,957
It won't break!

1061
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:47,374
- What are you doing?
- Wait.

1062
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:54,540
You'll have to jump the wall.

1063
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,124
Have you lost it?

1064
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:57,582
Do you have a better idea?

1065
01:15:57,708 --> 01:15:59,665
How will I get back inside?

1066
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:02,999
I have eight hours to figure that out.
I'll think of something.

1067
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:04,749
Come on, give me your bag.

1068
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:11,124
Put one foot here.

1069
01:16:11,791 --> 01:16:13,165
And one foot there.

1070
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,082
Yes.

1071
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:25,832
Land on your feet or you'll hurt yourself.

1072
01:16:29,416 --> 01:16:30,415
Are you okay?

1073
01:16:30,833 --> 01:16:31,874
Yes, and you?

1074
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:33,415
I'm fine.

1075
01:16:35,375 --> 01:16:36,707
Listen...

1076
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:38,332
Yes?

1077
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:40,665
I also love you.

1078
01:16:43,541 --> 01:16:44,749
Thank you.

1079
01:16:50,541 --> 01:16:52,249
The airport, please.

1080
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:56,290
Please drive faster.

1081
01:16:57,125 --> 01:17:00,249
At the airport, show your school ID and ticket.

1082
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:03,832
If questioned,
say that your grandfather is unwell.

1083
01:17:03,916 --> 01:17:05,332
You travelling alone?

1084
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,457
My grandfather is unwell.

1085
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:09,415
Okay.

1086
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,249
At the airline counter, ask for a window seat.

1087
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:19,415
- Can I have a window seat, please?
- Yes, sure.

1088
01:17:29,875 --> 01:17:33,124
Uncle, you are on my seat.

1089
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:35,040
It's a short flight. Sit anywhere.

1090
01:17:40,041 --> 01:17:42,040
But the window seat is mine.

1091
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:44,124
How does it matter?

1092
01:17:44,208 --> 01:17:46,415
I'm already sitting here. You sit here.

1093
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:51,165
Uncle, that's my seat. Get up!

1094
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,332
Come!

1095
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:08,832
Don't forget to wear your seat belt.

1096
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:18,165
When the plane takes off, then you'll see...

1097
01:18:18,666 --> 01:18:21,957
how big the world is, and how small Baroda.

1098
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:25,540
Your bad mood, your father, Miss Sheetal,

1099
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:28,499
leaving everyone below, you will fly away.

1100
01:18:29,083 --> 01:18:32,540
I'll wave to you from down,
but you won't see me.

1101
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:51,040
Do you need an auto rickshaw? A taxi?

1102
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:52,957
A hotel? Where do you want to go?

1103
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:01,707
Secret Superstar?

1104
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:03,957
No.

1105
01:19:04,166 --> 01:19:05,915
I'm the airport pickup.

1106
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:07,624
I'm Ranjeet.

1107
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:09,124
Come.

1108
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:11,290
Has Shakti Kumaarr sent you?

1109
01:19:11,375 --> 01:19:13,999
Yes, ma'am. Shakti Kumaarr has sent me.

1110
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:16,332
Now, shall we? Or we'll be late.

1111
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:17,665
Come on.

1112
01:19:24,458 --> 01:19:27,290
Unions don't operate on relationships,
but money.

1113
01:19:27,375 --> 01:19:29,207
Give as much as you want.

1114
01:19:30,666 --> 01:19:32,124
I'll call you back.

1115
01:19:54,375 --> 01:19:56,249
What a voice!

1116
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:57,582
Wow.

1117
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,124
My pleasure to meet you, kiddo.

1118
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,790
You okay?

1119
01:20:02,916 --> 01:20:04,457
Tea? Coffee? Coke?

1120
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:05,874
Coke?

1121
01:20:07,458 --> 01:20:08,999
What an interesting journey!

1122
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:10,665
What a story!

1123
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,082
Baroda... Burqa... YouTube...

1124
01:20:13,083 --> 01:20:14,374
Shakti Kumaarr... and then...

1125
01:20:14,458 --> 01:20:15,915
Superstar!

1126
01:20:16,583 --> 01:20:18,665
I'll host a launch event for you.
At a five star hotel.

1127
01:20:18,666 --> 01:20:19,499
Big time!

1128
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,249
Industry, media, trade.

1129
01:20:21,375 --> 01:20:23,874
I'll buy the front page
of Mumbai Times for you.

1130
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:27,665
Shakti Kumaarr launches
YouTube sensation, Insia!

1131
01:20:29,416 --> 01:20:32,999
Babes, don't mind,
but your name is low on glamour.

1132
01:20:33,916 --> 01:20:36,165
What does it mean? Your name? Insia?

1133
01:20:36,291 --> 01:20:38,040
It means 'woman'.

1134
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:39,874
Oh! Woman...

1135
01:20:40,166 --> 01:20:41,290
Woman.

1136
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:45,499
It sounds awful and it's meaning is worse.

1137
01:20:45,833 --> 01:20:47,374
What about Shabnam?

1138
01:20:47,791 --> 01:20:48,915
Too old fashioned.

1139
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:49,790
Sunny?

1140
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:51,457
- It's taken.
- Ah, it's taken.

1141
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:53,165
Natashha!

1142
01:20:53,291 --> 01:20:54,999
Natashha with a double H.

1143
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:58,207
N-A-T-A-S-H-H-A

1144
01:20:58,333 --> 01:20:59,290
That's the one!

1145
01:20:59,375 --> 01:21:04,082
Sir, I'm sorry
but my identity needs to remain a secret.

1146
01:21:04,375 --> 01:21:08,249
If my father finds out, I'll be dead meat.

1147
01:21:08,958 --> 01:21:11,082
Look kiddo, sooner or later the media
will find out.

1148
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:13,165
Whether I tell them or not.

1149
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:16,915
Anyway, we are short on time.
The song shoot is in two days.

1150
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,540
The album releases in two weeks.
And the film, in two months.

1151
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,165
And you have to get back to school
in six hours.

1152
01:21:22,625 --> 01:21:24,415
So, let's not waste time. Okay.

1153
01:21:24,541 --> 01:21:25,957
Ali, play the song.

1154
01:21:52,916 --> 01:21:54,707
"I'll speak your words."

1155
01:21:54,791 --> 01:21:56,457
"I'll sing your praise."

1156
01:21:56,541 --> 01:22:00,332
"I'll adorn myself
with the colours of your love."

1157
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:12,374
"Oh, I dance wild and free,

1158
01:22:12,458 --> 01:22:16,582
"for you, my sexy lover!"

1159
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:20,457
"O, my sexy lover!"

1160
01:22:20,541 --> 01:22:24,874
"O, my sexy lover!"

1161
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:26,665
Ali, cut... cut.

1162
01:22:28,166 --> 01:22:29,374
Superhit.

1163
01:22:29,583 --> 01:22:31,165
It's a superhit, kiddo.

1164
01:22:32,041 --> 01:22:33,624
It's a gift from God... through me.

1165
01:22:33,708 --> 01:22:35,582
On the mic, kiddo.

1166
01:22:35,666 --> 01:22:36,915
Ranjeet, take her to the mic.

1167
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,207
Come on.

1168
01:22:47,583 --> 01:22:50,374
- Ali, is everything ready?
- Yes, sir.

1169
01:22:50,458 --> 01:22:51,749
Well done.

1170
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:01,165
It's a sure hit, kiddo. Superhit!

1171
01:23:01,291 --> 01:23:02,540
Just sing it.

1172
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:03,790
Come on. Go for it.

1173
01:23:03,916 --> 01:23:05,582
Sir, two minutes.

1174
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:06,499
Yeah, okay.

1175
01:23:06,583 --> 01:23:07,707
Take your time.

1176
01:23:22,041 --> 01:23:22,832
Let's start.

1177
01:23:22,916 --> 01:23:23,790
Ready. Come on.

1178
01:23:23,875 --> 01:23:24,874
Let's go.

1179
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:28,082
Go for it, kiddo.

1180
01:23:32,958 --> 01:23:34,457
Not like this, kiddo.

1181
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,707
Don't you get it?

1182
01:23:45,416 --> 01:23:46,624
Okay?

1183
01:23:50,333 --> 01:23:51,290
Cut it... cut it!

1184
01:23:53,125 --> 01:23:55,665
Do one thing. Start from the verse.

1185
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:57,874
- We'll patch the moaning later.
- Yes, sir.

1186
01:23:59,041 --> 01:24:00,707
"I'll speak your words."

1187
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:02,624
"I'll sing your praise."

1188
01:24:02,708 --> 01:24:03,957
"I'll adorn myself with the colours..."

1189
01:24:04,041 --> 01:24:06,374
This is not a hymn, kiddo.

1190
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:10,165
Sing it with feeling.
Get the feeling of the song.

1191
01:24:12,208 --> 01:24:13,999
"I'll speak your words."

1192
01:24:14,083 --> 01:24:15,332
"I'll sing your praise."

1193
01:24:15,416 --> 01:24:16,874
Cut it... cut it...

1194
01:24:17,083 --> 01:24:18,415
Look at me, babes. Look at me.

1195
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:19,874
You are making a mistake.

1196
01:24:19,958 --> 01:24:21,915
You are singing from your head.

1197
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:23,999
Do you know where you should be singing from?

1198
01:24:24,333 --> 01:24:26,249
Heart, sir. From the heart.

1199
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:27,832
Doomed!

1200
01:24:28,041 --> 01:24:29,957
She wants to sing from the heart.

1201
01:24:30,541 --> 01:24:32,207
You don't have to sing from the heart, kiddo.

1202
01:24:32,291 --> 01:24:34,124
You have to sing with your body.

1203
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:36,207
- Meaning?
- Body language.

1204
01:24:38,208 --> 01:24:40,332
Body language. Okay?

1205
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,874
You know what, you need to loosen up.
Open up a little.

1206
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:44,457
Try jogging.

1207
01:24:44,541 --> 01:24:45,832
- Jogging?
- Yes.

1208
01:24:45,916 --> 01:24:47,665
- Where?
- Right there. Spot jogging.

1209
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:48,749
Come on, I'll show you.

1210
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:50,499
Yeah... come on... one... two.

1211
01:24:50,833 --> 01:24:52,124
Yes, go for it. Knees up...

1212
01:24:52,208 --> 01:24:54,624
One, two. Bounce... bounce.

1213
01:24:54,958 --> 01:24:56,999
One, two, one, two...

1214
01:24:57,083 --> 01:24:59,749
Yeah, well done. Very good.

1215
01:25:00,375 --> 01:25:01,832
Yeah... yeah.

1216
01:25:02,708 --> 01:25:03,582
Feeling better? Eh?

1217
01:25:03,666 --> 01:25:06,165
Come on. Very good, kiddo.
Buck up, India... buck up, India.

1218
01:25:09,958 --> 01:25:13,749
"I'll praise your speak. I'll words your sing."

1219
01:25:28,208 --> 01:25:30,249
Kiddo, give me something.

1220
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:31,915
Something... anything!

1221
01:25:34,833 --> 01:25:36,124
Come on. Go for it.

1222
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:40,665
"I'll..."

1223
01:25:52,666 --> 01:25:55,040
Listen, you won't be able to do it.

1224
01:25:55,291 --> 01:25:57,540
Ranjeet will drop you to the airport.

1225
01:26:00,416 --> 01:26:03,582
There's a huge difference between
singing at home, and singing in front of a mic.

1226
01:26:03,708 --> 01:26:05,540
Not everyone's cup of tea.

1227
01:26:05,625 --> 01:26:08,124
You... go back to school.

1228
01:26:15,458 --> 01:26:16,749
Sir.

1229
01:26:17,541 --> 01:26:18,540
What?

1230
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:21,082
Sir, I need to use the toilet.

1231
01:26:39,291 --> 01:26:42,707
You know Insu, earlier,
he made such good songs.

1232
01:26:42,875 --> 01:26:44,790
But nowadays, when I listen to his songs,

1233
01:26:44,875 --> 01:26:47,832
it feels like
he has remixed some really nice song,

1234
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:50,415
and that nice song never got made.

1235
01:27:12,875 --> 01:27:15,999
I told you she's not good enough.
But you won't listen.

1236
01:27:16,083 --> 01:27:17,749
As it is, no one wants to work with you.

1237
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:19,415
Why are you destroying my film?

1238
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:20,874
I'll find someone.

1239
01:27:20,958 --> 01:27:22,540
Who will you find? Should I sing the song?

1240
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:24,957
Please leave this film. Spare me.

1241
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:26,249
Sir...

1242
01:27:26,916 --> 01:27:29,499
- Sir, can you step out for a minute, please.
- What is it?

1243
01:27:29,666 --> 01:27:31,665
I want to talk to you in private.

1244
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:41,332
What's up? What's the problem?

1245
01:27:41,416 --> 01:27:44,374
Sir, I feel the problem is not with me,
it's with your song.

1246
01:27:48,291 --> 01:27:51,249
Oh. You mean there's no problem with you.

1247
01:27:51,458 --> 01:27:53,082
The problem is with my song.

1248
01:27:53,208 --> 01:27:54,915
Wow... wow! Amazing! I like it!

1249
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:56,540
That's a new one. Amazing!

1250
01:27:56,625 --> 01:27:57,874
Sir, I'm not a professional singer.

1251
01:27:57,958 --> 01:27:59,207
I can see that.

1252
01:27:59,291 --> 01:28:01,165
Sir, actually I'm a listener.

1253
01:28:01,875 --> 01:28:05,832
Ever since I was born... my mom played to me
Bollywood songs... new, old, all!

1254
01:28:05,916 --> 01:28:07,915
So? What am I supposed to do?

1255
01:28:08,458 --> 01:28:10,457
I need the song, babes.

1256
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:12,957
I've no interest in your nonsense.

1257
01:28:13,375 --> 01:28:15,957
But you should be interested in my nonsense!

1258
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:22,249
What!

1259
01:28:22,333 --> 01:28:23,832
I read in the news,

1260
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:25,832
that the Singer's Association
has boycotted you.

1261
01:28:25,916 --> 01:28:28,874
Who are they to boycott me?
I boycott them. Scram! Boycott!

1262
01:28:28,958 --> 01:28:30,665
Sir, let me finish.

1263
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:33,332
Yours is a romantic song,
but the tune is disco.

1264
01:28:33,416 --> 01:28:36,332
Such good lyrics,
and you've ruined them with innuendo.

1265
01:28:36,416 --> 01:28:41,332
It feels like a remixed version of
a great song... which never got made!

1266
01:28:41,583 --> 01:28:43,957
My mom says that, too.

1267
01:28:44,208 --> 01:28:46,665
This song should be one from the heart...

1268
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:48,249
2007

1269
01:28:49,583 --> 01:28:50,790
Huh?

1270
01:28:51,291 --> 01:28:54,499
2007. I made this song 1 0 years ago.

1271
01:28:55,583 --> 01:28:57,165
This is the remix version...

1272
01:28:57,333 --> 01:28:58,540
Party song... party song!

1273
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:01,915
The producer kept asking for a party song.
I spun it around.

1274
01:29:02,625 --> 01:29:04,457
But, you're right.

1275
01:29:05,333 --> 01:29:06,874
This isn't the original.

1276
01:29:08,416 --> 01:29:12,790
"Your words and thoughts will flow from me."

1277
01:29:13,583 --> 01:29:17,624
"In your praise and devotion,
will I always sing."

1278
01:29:18,333 --> 01:29:23,540
"In robes weaved of your love,
I'll dress myself,"

1279
01:29:23,625 --> 01:29:28,207
"and merge into your colours."

1280
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:34,040
"With ornaments bejeweled with your love,
I'll decorate myself,"

1281
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:38,790
"and merge into your radiance."

1282
01:29:39,041 --> 01:29:48,499
"I dance wild and free,
adorned in you, my love."

1283
01:29:51,416 --> 01:29:52,957
Sir, this is what I will sing.

1284
01:29:53,041 --> 01:29:54,332
Exactly this way.

1285
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:56,040
- You like it?
- Love it!

1286
01:29:56,125 --> 01:29:57,290
It's a flop.

1287
01:29:57,375 --> 01:29:58,540
Too slow.

1288
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:01,665
Nowadays, everyone wants a fast song.

1289
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:03,874
Sir, that's not true.

1290
01:30:04,291 --> 01:30:05,957
Have you heard the songs of Aashique 2?

1291
01:30:06,041 --> 01:30:08,207
Not a single fast song.
Yet they were superhits.

1292
01:30:08,291 --> 01:30:09,832
Ha! They just got lucky.

1293
01:30:10,791 --> 01:30:11,957
But...

1294
01:30:12,083 --> 01:30:13,124
You're smart.

1295
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:15,749
So sir, let me try it once.

1296
01:30:15,833 --> 01:30:17,499
I'll sing it just the way you did.

1297
01:30:17,583 --> 01:30:19,457
The producer won't agree.

1298
01:30:19,583 --> 01:30:21,207
Sir, let me try once.

1299
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:23,457
Not with 'body language', but from the heart.

1300
01:30:23,583 --> 01:30:24,915
Just once. For me?

1301
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:27,499
For you?

1302
01:30:27,625 --> 01:30:28,665
Please.

1303
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:32,624
Sir, it's a lovely song.

1304
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:35,332
But can I remove the word 'sexy', please?

1305
01:30:35,416 --> 01:30:38,624
Shakti had put in that word. Remove it.

1306
01:30:39,625 --> 01:30:40,957
Ali, cancel this session.

1307
01:30:41,041 --> 01:30:43,915
Load the one from 2007. The old one.

1308
01:30:44,875 --> 01:30:46,540
I'm trying a new version. Check it out.

1309
01:30:46,625 --> 01:30:48,499
Sir, the slow one?

1310
01:30:48,583 --> 01:30:51,040
Why? Do you have a problem?
Just do what I'm saying!

1311
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:26,415
"Your words and thoughts will flow from me."

1312
01:31:27,041 --> 01:31:31,957
"In your praise and devotion,
will I always sing."

1313
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:37,707
"In robes weaved of your love,
I'll dress myself,"

1314
01:31:37,791 --> 01:31:42,874
"and merge into your colours."

1315
01:31:43,416 --> 01:31:48,832
"With ornaments bejeweled with your love,
I'll decorate myself,"

1316
01:31:48,958 --> 01:31:53,749
"and merge into your radiance."

1317
01:31:53,958 --> 01:32:04,832
"I dance wild and free,
adorned in you, my love."

1318
01:32:05,125 --> 01:32:14,874
"I dance wild and free,
resonating with you, my love."

1319
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:44,374
"I've lost my bearings, the world taunts."

1320
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:49,624
"I'm beyond consciousness, beyond reason,
I've lost myself, they say."

1321
01:32:49,708 --> 01:32:55,415
"I've lost my identity to you, they scorn me."

1322
01:32:55,958 --> 01:33:01,082
"But what do they know,
the mysteries of this heart."

1323
01:33:01,166 --> 01:33:06,207
"By losing myself, and realizing you,"

1324
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:12,749
"I've found myself. I'm complete.
I'm one with myself."

1325
01:33:13,083 --> 01:33:17,290
"I'll abandon all ties, and come to you."

1326
01:33:18,625 --> 01:33:23,082
"All evil aimed at you, let it befall me."

1327
01:33:23,875 --> 01:33:29,290
"In robes weaved of your love,
I'll dress myself,"

1328
01:33:29,416 --> 01:33:34,374
"and merge into your colours."

1329
01:33:35,083 --> 01:33:40,540
"With ornaments bejeweled with your love,
I'll decorate myself,"

1330
01:33:40,625 --> 01:33:45,499
"and merge into your radiance."

1331
01:33:45,625 --> 01:33:56,207
"I dance wild and free,
adorned in you, my love."

1332
01:33:56,791 --> 01:34:05,540
"I dance wild and free,
resonating with you, my love."

1333
01:34:30,291 --> 01:34:40,290
"I dance wild and free,
adorned in you, my love."

1334
01:34:41,416 --> 01:34:52,915
"I dance wild and free,
resonating with you, my love."

1335
01:35:11,541 --> 01:35:13,457
Superhit... superhit!

1336
01:35:14,083 --> 01:35:15,332
Babes.

1337
01:35:15,458 --> 01:35:17,874
You've no idea how I'm feeling right now.

1338
01:35:18,666 --> 01:35:21,749
I feel as though this
was the first recording of my life.

1339
01:35:23,625 --> 01:35:25,165
You won't understand.

1340
01:35:25,541 --> 01:35:28,915
Sir, actually this really
was the first recording of my life.

1341
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:33,749
"With ornaments bejeweled with your love,
I'll decorate myself..."

1342
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:36,124
Wow.

1343
01:35:38,291 --> 01:35:41,290
Sir, I want to discuss something with you.

1344
01:35:41,583 --> 01:35:43,165
Yes, tell me. What is it?

1345
01:35:43,833 --> 01:35:45,915
Sir, I want your help.

1346
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:47,707
Help?

1347
01:35:47,791 --> 01:35:48,915
I'm so sorry!

1348
01:35:49,208 --> 01:35:50,790
Your fees, yes. Sorry... sorry!

1349
01:35:51,291 --> 01:35:52,790
Your friend... Chintan?

1350
01:35:52,791 --> 01:35:54,124
Should I send him your cheque?

1351
01:35:54,125 --> 01:35:56,540
No sir, I don't want money.

1352
01:35:56,791 --> 01:35:58,790
I just need your help.

1353
01:36:00,333 --> 01:36:03,665
Kiddo, once this song releases,

1354
01:36:03,666 --> 01:36:05,457
you won't need anyone's help.

1355
01:36:05,916 --> 01:36:09,999
Producers and music composers
will line up outside your house.

1356
01:36:10,541 --> 01:36:12,040
Sir, aren't you divorced?

1357
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:18,040
What do you mean?

1358
01:36:18,166 --> 01:36:19,957
Your wife has left you.

1359
01:36:20,416 --> 01:36:22,124
She's taken your kids, too.

1360
01:36:22,208 --> 01:36:23,332
Yes, so?

1361
01:36:23,416 --> 01:36:25,707
I want to meet your wife's lawyer.

1362
01:36:25,958 --> 01:36:28,290
I want to get my parents divorced.

1363
01:36:28,666 --> 01:36:30,207
What? Why?

1364
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:35,915
Oh... I understand.

1365
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,915
I'm sorry. I can understand.

1366
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:40,165
Don't worry. I'll help you.

1367
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:42,540
I'll call my lawyer right away.
Kamlesh, he's a fantastic lawyer.

1368
01:36:42,625 --> 01:36:45,165
No, sir. Not your lawyer.
But your wife's lawyer.

1369
01:36:45,333 --> 01:36:46,665
Who? Sheena Sabavala?

1370
01:36:46,791 --> 01:36:47,832
She's crazy.

1371
01:36:47,875 --> 01:36:48,874
Bad idea... bad idea.

1372
01:36:48,958 --> 01:36:50,415
Sir, you promised.

1373
01:36:50,458 --> 01:36:52,124
Yes, and I'm not refusing you.

1374
01:36:52,208 --> 01:36:54,457
I'm helping you. Don't worry.

1375
01:36:54,541 --> 01:36:56,165
He's a fantastic lawyer. Hi, Kamlesh...

1376
01:36:56,208 --> 01:36:59,374
Sir, your 'fantastic' lawyer
lost your own case.

1377
01:37:04,125 --> 01:37:07,249
Kamlesh... listen... I'll... I'll call you back.

1378
01:37:07,333 --> 01:37:08,124
Okay?

1379
01:37:08,208 --> 01:37:09,457
Bye.

1380
01:37:28,791 --> 01:37:30,540
Hello Sheena, it's me.

1381
01:37:31,416 --> 01:37:32,332
What do you mean 'Who?'

1382
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:34,999
Don't pretend you don't know. Hello!

1383
01:37:37,041 --> 01:37:38,749
I know you're busy. I'm not free either.

1384
01:37:38,833 --> 01:37:40,082
I haven't called for small talk.

1385
01:37:40,166 --> 01:37:43,082
I have important work. Need to meet.
We'll talk when we meet.

1386
01:37:44,166 --> 01:37:47,624
No, this isn't about my divorce.
It's another matter.

1387
01:37:47,708 --> 01:37:49,915
It's about a girl...

1388
01:37:51,583 --> 01:37:52,374
Age...

1389
01:37:52,458 --> 01:37:54,040
- What's your age?
- 1 5

1390
01:37:54,208 --> 01:37:55,540
1 5 years.

1391
01:37:57,291 --> 01:37:59,124
What! How dare you, Sheena?

1392
01:37:59,208 --> 01:38:01,082
How can you even think like that?

1393
01:38:01,166 --> 01:38:03,374
You've gone crazy. You're mad!

1394
01:38:04,791 --> 01:38:06,540
You shut up! You shut up!

1395
01:38:07,625 --> 01:38:09,082
You shut up and you go to hell!

1396
01:38:09,166 --> 01:38:10,499
I will take you to the Supreme Court.

1397
01:38:10,583 --> 01:38:12,290
Yes. Bye!

1398
01:38:14,125 --> 01:38:16,832
I told you. She's bad news.

1399
01:38:29,666 --> 01:38:31,665
I tried... you saw me.

1400
01:38:31,833 --> 01:38:33,165
You saw what happened.

1401
01:38:59,375 --> 01:39:01,999
Hello, Sheena. I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry.

1402
01:39:02,083 --> 01:39:04,915
Listen to me. You're right.
You're absolutely right.

1403
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,665
I am a totally ill-mannered person.
You're right.

1404
01:39:07,833 --> 01:39:11,915
Listen, babes, my mother! I'm begging you.

1405
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,582
Not for me. It's for this little girl.
This innocent child.

1406
01:39:14,666 --> 01:39:15,582
Please.

1407
01:39:15,666 --> 01:39:17,082
She just needs half an hour. That's all.

1408
01:39:17,166 --> 01:39:18,790
Can we come now?

1409
01:39:20,875 --> 01:39:22,124
Next month?

1410
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:25,207
No, babes, that's too late.

1411
01:39:25,291 --> 01:39:27,332
Next week? It's an emergency.

1412
01:39:27,416 --> 01:39:28,707
Next week?

1413
01:39:30,041 --> 01:39:31,624
Next week, good. Done.

1414
01:39:31,708 --> 01:39:32,915
Thank you, babes.

1415
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,290
You're a sweetheart... sweetheart.

1416
01:39:36,541 --> 01:39:37,957
Witch!

1417
01:39:42,166 --> 01:39:42,957
Thank you, sir.

1418
01:39:43,041 --> 01:39:45,165
So, see you next week.

1419
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:47,582
I'll send your ticket to your boyfriend.

1420
01:39:47,666 --> 01:39:49,749
What's his name? Yeah, Chintan.

1421
01:39:50,291 --> 01:39:51,957
Sir, he's not my boyfriend.

1422
01:39:52,041 --> 01:39:54,332
What? He's not your boyfriend?

1423
01:39:55,375 --> 01:39:57,207
Then, why are you blushing?

1424
01:39:57,291 --> 01:39:58,582
Bye.

1425
01:40:10,791 --> 01:40:12,082
Chintan!

1426
01:40:21,583 --> 01:40:24,374
Mom, all the material
I need for my project is missing.

1427
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:28,832
Oh Insu! We bought it just a few days ago.
Where can it go? Did you leave it in school?

1428
01:40:29,875 --> 01:40:32,582
Mom, how will I complete my school project now?

1429
01:40:33,291 --> 01:40:35,165
Guddu, get ready for bed.

1430
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:36,457
Guddu...

1431
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:39,582
have you seen my glue bottle?

1432
01:40:42,416 --> 01:40:43,499
And my brown tape?

1433
01:40:45,416 --> 01:40:46,540
No?

1434
01:40:48,333 --> 01:40:49,707
Should I slap you?

1435
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:53,457
Mom, tell him not to touch my stuff.

1436
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:56,790
Guddu, how many times
have I told you not to touch her things?

1437
01:40:56,875 --> 01:40:58,957
I was making a gift for Insu.

1438
01:40:59,125 --> 01:41:00,749
There's no need to make me a gift.

1439
01:41:00,916 --> 01:41:01,874
Okay.

1440
01:41:09,208 --> 01:41:10,665
Airport, please.

1441
01:41:19,583 --> 01:41:20,915
Come, kiddo.

1442
01:41:24,041 --> 01:41:27,457
Babes, tell Sheena that Shakti is here.

1443
01:41:28,041 --> 01:41:29,332
She's busy.

1444
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:30,415
Please wait.

1445
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:31,999
Oh. Busy?

1446
01:41:32,958 --> 01:41:34,207
"Please wait."

1447
01:41:35,041 --> 01:41:36,165
Come, kiddo.

1448
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:37,290
Sit.

1449
01:41:51,416 --> 01:41:53,665
Oh my... I'm heart broken.

1450
01:41:54,791 --> 01:41:56,207
No, thanks.

1451
01:41:56,666 --> 01:41:58,665
I'm better off "thirsty".

1452
01:42:02,375 --> 01:42:03,665
Come.

1453
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:07,415
I'll see you now on Monday.

1454
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:11,999
Come in.

1455
01:42:12,416 --> 01:42:13,457
Not you.

1456
01:42:14,791 --> 01:42:15,874
You go.

1457
01:42:15,958 --> 01:42:17,415
Insia, come.

1458
01:42:21,250 --> 01:42:22,540
Come.

1459
01:42:25,375 --> 01:42:27,665
So, tell me. What can I do for you?

1460
01:42:30,625 --> 01:42:32,457
Ma'am... um...

1461
01:42:32,916 --> 01:42:34,290
my father...

1462
01:42:34,375 --> 01:42:38,915
he beats my mother... for every little thing.

1463
01:42:39,833 --> 01:42:43,374
Once, mom forgot to turn on the water heater.

1464
01:42:43,458 --> 01:42:45,207
He broke her hand.

1465
01:43:20,958 --> 01:43:23,665
Babes, have you heard my new song?

1466
01:43:23,791 --> 01:43:26,499
Which one? Which one, 'Soft and Tender'?

1467
01:43:27,708 --> 01:43:29,332
No... that's old.

1468
01:43:29,916 --> 01:43:31,415
The new one is...

1469
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:33,290
Rough and Ready'.

1470
01:43:34,375 --> 01:43:37,207
Look, Insia. This is a difficult case.

1471
01:43:37,291 --> 01:43:40,415
Firstly, Guddu and you are children.
You are minors.

1472
01:43:40,625 --> 01:43:41,957
You understand?

1473
01:43:42,166 --> 01:43:46,374
Furthermore, your mother's
financial situation isn't strong.

1474
01:43:47,625 --> 01:43:51,624
Anyway, I will prepare a file for you.
Take it home.

1475
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:53,957
Read it to your mother
and tell her what's written in it.

1476
01:43:54,083 --> 01:43:55,540
Explain it to her. Okay?

1477
01:43:55,625 --> 01:43:59,499
And then get her to sign on it.
She has to sign all the papers.

1478
01:43:59,583 --> 01:44:00,415
Alright, ma'am.

1479
01:44:00,833 --> 01:44:05,457
The lines on your palm tell me,
there's a new love in your life.

1480
01:44:11,958 --> 01:44:13,249
Here.

1481
01:44:14,250 --> 01:44:16,457
- Thank you so much, ma'am.
- You're welcome.

1482
01:44:16,583 --> 01:44:18,749
Ma'am, I can't afford your fees...

1483
01:44:18,833 --> 01:44:21,499
Don't worry. She's a very cheap lawyer.

1484
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:23,249
I'll handle it. Come.

1485
01:44:23,625 --> 01:44:25,207
- Bye, ma'am.
- Bye.

1486
01:44:25,458 --> 01:44:26,582
Listen.

1487
01:44:27,666 --> 01:44:28,707
I'm proud of you.

1488
01:44:28,916 --> 01:44:29,832
Thank you, ma'am.

1489
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,290
No, dear. I was telling him.

1490
01:44:34,458 --> 01:44:37,082
Perhaps you are not as bad as you seem.

1491
01:44:37,458 --> 01:44:40,457
- Sweetheart... sweetheart...
- Don't push it.

1492
01:44:46,541 --> 01:44:47,624
Cheers.

1493
01:44:52,333 --> 01:44:53,832
Sir, may I ask you something?

1494
01:44:53,916 --> 01:44:54,874
Yeah?

1495
01:44:55,041 --> 01:44:56,790
Why are you helping me?

1496
01:44:58,666 --> 01:45:00,124
Kiddo, actually...

1497
01:45:01,041 --> 01:45:03,540
our stories are very similar.

1498
01:45:04,083 --> 01:45:05,165
How's that?

1499
01:45:06,333 --> 01:45:10,624
You know, in the past 1 0 years,
I've been divorced twice.

1500
01:45:12,083 --> 01:45:13,999
My brother sued me.

1501
01:45:15,083 --> 01:45:17,082
Effectively, I pretty much have no family.

1502
01:45:17,666 --> 01:45:20,749
This film industry
is my all... mother, sister, family.

1503
01:45:21,083 --> 01:45:26,165
And, this film industry too,
has never given me an ounce of love.

1504
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,249
They nominate me every year,

1505
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,999
but have never given me an award.

1506
01:45:33,875 --> 01:45:36,499
How does this make our stories similar?

1507
01:45:38,208 --> 01:45:39,415
Anyways...

1508
01:45:39,875 --> 01:45:42,332
how did you learn to play the guitar?

1509
01:45:43,375 --> 01:45:46,499
I was six... mom got me a guitar.

1510
01:45:50,083 --> 01:45:53,249
Sir, I want to shift to Mumbai. With mom.

1511
01:45:54,333 --> 01:45:56,832
I want to learn to sing... properly.

1512
01:45:57,625 --> 01:45:59,624
Then, maybe I can be
a part of Singing Idol, too.

1513
01:45:59,708 --> 01:46:02,374
Kids like you don't need Singing Idol.

1514
01:46:03,416 --> 01:46:04,957
Then how will I become a superstar?

1515
01:46:05,041 --> 01:46:06,665
You will become one anyway.

1516
01:46:07,375 --> 01:46:09,457
Talented kids like you are...

1517
01:46:12,083 --> 01:46:13,790
Er... how do I explain?

1518
01:46:15,875 --> 01:46:17,790
Are like bubbles in a soda.

1519
01:46:18,208 --> 01:46:21,957
See these bubbles? Rising one by one?

1520
01:46:22,666 --> 01:46:23,790
So?

1521
01:46:24,875 --> 01:46:26,749
Talented kids are like that.

1522
01:46:26,916 --> 01:46:29,582
They rise up like this. On their own.

1523
01:46:29,875 --> 01:46:31,290
Nothing can stop them.

1524
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:43,624
Thank you so much, sir.

1525
01:46:43,708 --> 01:46:44,915
No problem, kiddo.

1526
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,249
Any problem... call me. Okay?

1527
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:49,915
And once you've reached home safely,

1528
01:46:50,166 --> 01:46:51,415
tell Chintan to give me a missed call.

1529
01:46:51,916 --> 01:46:53,290
- Bye.
- Bye.

1530
01:47:13,333 --> 01:47:14,707
Take care, kiddo.

1531
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:17,124
God bless.

1532
01:47:18,666 --> 01:47:19,957
Bye, sir.

1533
01:47:45,083 --> 01:47:46,915
Mom, get down, I want to talk to you.

1534
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,082
Not now, Insu.

1535
01:47:48,166 --> 01:47:49,582
Hurry up and start cutting the vegetables.

1536
01:47:49,666 --> 01:47:51,249
Mom, get down.

1537
01:47:51,541 --> 01:47:52,540
Not now. Later...

1538
01:47:52,625 --> 01:47:54,249
Mom, it's very important... get down.

1539
01:47:56,708 --> 01:47:57,832
What is it?

1540
01:47:57,958 --> 01:47:59,165
Sit.

1541
01:47:59,708 --> 01:48:01,999
Mom, I... I had gone to Mumbai.

1542
01:48:02,166 --> 01:48:05,124
Shakti Kumaarr, the composer,
he sent me an email.

1543
01:48:05,208 --> 01:48:07,582
He called me to Mumbai to record a song.

1544
01:48:07,666 --> 01:48:09,082
The recording went very well.

1545
01:48:09,166 --> 01:48:11,582
After that, Shakti sir got me to meet a lawyer.

1546
01:48:11,666 --> 01:48:13,540
She's a famous lawyer in Mumbai.

1547
01:48:13,708 --> 01:48:15,915
She has given these divorce papers.

1548
01:48:16,541 --> 01:48:17,915
Take a look.

1549
01:48:20,666 --> 01:48:22,790
Mom, please leave father.

1550
01:48:22,875 --> 01:48:24,874
Then we won't need to go to Saudi Arabia.

1551
01:48:24,958 --> 01:48:26,624
I'll become a famous singer.

1552
01:48:26,708 --> 01:48:29,165
And Shakti sir said that he would help.

1553
01:48:34,458 --> 01:48:35,999
You went to Mumbai?

1554
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:38,582
When?

1555
01:48:39,083 --> 01:48:41,249
Last week. And today.

1556
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:42,874
Mom, the plan is ready.

1557
01:48:42,958 --> 01:48:44,374
In a plane?

1558
01:48:44,708 --> 01:48:45,999
Alone?

1559
01:48:47,333 --> 01:48:48,332
And school?

1560
01:48:48,416 --> 01:48:50,332
Mom, I was going to tell you but...

1561
01:48:50,416 --> 01:48:52,082
Have you grown up so much,

1562
01:48:52,750 --> 01:48:54,332
that you'll go to Mumbai alone?

1563
01:48:54,416 --> 01:48:56,040
You'll get your parents divorced?

1564
01:48:56,125 --> 01:48:57,707
But, mom, I told you that I had a plan.

1565
01:48:57,791 --> 01:48:59,374
What were you thinking when you went to Mumbai?

1566
01:48:59,375 --> 01:49:03,207
If something had happened to you,
how would I know?

1567
01:49:03,791 --> 01:49:05,624
You met a lawyer, too!

1568
01:49:05,875 --> 01:49:07,665
What were you thinking? Meeting a lawyer?

1569
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:09,290
That you'll get your parents divorced?

1570
01:49:09,375 --> 01:49:11,499
Did you ask me whether I want a divorce?

1571
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:13,999
And what is this nonsense about divorce?

1572
01:49:14,125 --> 01:49:15,624
What has your father done?

1573
01:49:15,708 --> 01:49:18,207
Don't you know what he has done?

1574
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:20,249
He beats you up all the time.
He has a bad temper.

1575
01:49:20,333 --> 01:49:23,790
He doesn't have control. Which man does...?

1576
01:49:23,875 --> 01:49:25,040
Please, mom!

1577
01:49:25,291 --> 01:49:27,082
What sort of life are we living?

1578
01:49:27,250 --> 01:49:29,207
We aren't even allowed to breathe.

1579
01:49:29,333 --> 01:49:31,082
Now, he will take us to Saudi.

1580
01:49:31,166 --> 01:49:34,124
Marry me off to someone like him.
Without even asking me.

1581
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:36,207
My life will become like yours.

1582
01:49:36,333 --> 01:49:39,624
Look Insu, everyone has their limitations.

1583
01:49:39,708 --> 01:49:41,707
But I don't, mom.

1584
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,415
Mom, trust me. I'll make everything okay.

1585
01:49:44,541 --> 01:49:46,124
What'll you do?

1586
01:49:47,291 --> 01:49:49,915
My father didn't ask me
before getting me married.

1587
01:49:50,625 --> 01:49:53,332
My daughter didn't ask me if I want a divorce.

1588
01:49:53,791 --> 01:49:55,749
No one cares about what I want.

1589
01:49:55,833 --> 01:49:57,082
Whatever, mom.

1590
01:49:57,208 --> 01:49:58,457
I won't go to Saudi.

1591
01:49:58,541 --> 01:49:59,915
That's it, Insu.

1592
01:50:00,375 --> 01:50:01,999
This is my world.

1593
01:50:02,291 --> 01:50:04,249
And this is your world, too!

1594
01:50:05,458 --> 01:50:09,249
And in our reality,
I've given you as much freedom as I could.

1595
01:50:12,041 --> 01:50:15,582
But, don't dream of flying beyond this. Don't!

1596
01:50:16,583 --> 01:50:18,915
We are going to Saudi with your father.

1597
01:50:19,250 --> 01:50:21,707
I won't let your education stop, I promise.

1598
01:50:21,791 --> 01:50:24,374
But, my dream of becoming a singer
will never come true.

1599
01:50:24,458 --> 01:50:26,165
Don't argue with me.

1600
01:50:26,416 --> 01:50:29,374
We are going to Saudi with your father.

1601
01:50:29,458 --> 01:50:31,290
I won't go to Saudi.

1602
01:50:31,541 --> 01:50:34,415
I can't believe how you can be so stupid.

1603
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:36,207
Doesn't it make any difference to you?

1604
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:39,040
My life will be wasted, mom.

1605
01:50:39,250 --> 01:50:42,874
You're such a coward that
you can't do anything for your daughter!

1606
01:52:04,125 --> 01:52:05,415
The gift?

1607
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:08,207
It wasn't ready yet.

1608
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:32,832
I'm sorry, Guddu.

1609
01:52:33,125 --> 01:52:34,374
It's okay.

1610
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:35,374
Give it to me.

1611
01:52:35,458 --> 01:52:37,332
It's not done yet.

1612
01:52:38,583 --> 01:52:42,415
Insia, now apologise to your mother.

1613
01:52:42,583 --> 01:52:44,540
I won't apologise to mom.

1614
01:52:44,958 --> 01:52:46,624
It's her fault. Not mine.

1615
01:52:46,708 --> 01:52:50,457
Her biggest mistake is
that she gave birth to you.

1616
01:52:51,916 --> 01:52:54,165
Your father had said,

1617
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:58,040
"What will you do with a girl?"

1618
01:52:58,791 --> 01:53:00,332
"Abort her."

1619
01:53:00,708 --> 01:53:02,540
Najma was adamant.

1620
01:53:03,041 --> 01:53:07,999
Everyone beat her up.
They dragged her to the doctor.

1621
01:53:09,916 --> 01:53:10,749
Then?

1622
01:53:10,833 --> 01:53:16,665
The doctor said, "It's late today.
We will operate on her tomorrow."

1623
01:53:17,041 --> 01:53:19,332
They kept her in the hospital all night.

1624
01:53:19,541 --> 01:53:21,082
Didn't you say anything?

1625
01:53:21,375 --> 01:53:29,707
I constantly wonder
why my mother didn't abort me?

1626
01:53:30,458 --> 01:53:32,915
What good has my life been?

1627
01:53:33,291 --> 01:53:35,415
And mom? The operation?

1628
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:38,165
Next day, when we went to the hospital,

1629
01:53:38,375 --> 01:53:41,249
your mother had escaped.

1630
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:47,290
1 0 months later, when she returned, with you,

1631
01:53:47,916 --> 01:53:53,332
she said, "Next time if it's a girl,
we could abort."

1632
01:53:53,458 --> 01:53:57,415
"Let's keep her. This is my Insia."

1633
01:53:58,250 --> 01:53:59,832
Where was I born?

1634
01:53:59,916 --> 01:54:01,332
And where was mom?

1635
01:54:01,416 --> 01:54:03,665
How does it matter?

1636
01:54:04,875 --> 01:54:08,665
It's your mother's fault, not yours.

1637
01:54:09,625 --> 01:54:12,082
Why should you apologise?

1638
01:54:15,250 --> 01:54:16,665
Listen.

1639
01:54:17,291 --> 01:54:21,165
Najma never wanted you to know all this.

1640
01:54:21,625 --> 01:54:23,749
Don't tell her you know.

1641
01:54:24,083 --> 01:54:25,415
Understand?

1642
01:54:26,083 --> 01:54:26,832
But...

1643
01:54:26,916 --> 01:54:31,165
The joy I'm getting in telling you this,

1644
01:54:31,666 --> 01:54:37,374
is nothing compared to the joy
your mother gets in keeping this from you.

1645
01:55:22,458 --> 01:55:32,457
"This great big world suddenly seems so small."

1646
01:55:35,708 --> 01:55:42,999
"I took flight only to crash
into a glass ceiling."

1647
01:55:44,791 --> 01:55:49,874
"O my heart, stop insisting."

1648
01:55:49,958 --> 01:55:55,124
"O my heart, stop insisting."

1649
01:55:55,250 --> 01:56:05,082
"Lock your cage from within,
along with your dreams."

1650
01:56:05,416 --> 01:56:10,332
"O my heart, stop insisting."

1651
01:56:10,541 --> 01:56:15,665
"O my heart, stop insisting."

1652
01:56:15,791 --> 01:56:24,874
"Lock your cage from within,
along with your dreams."

1653
01:56:26,791 --> 01:56:29,165
Kiddo, I've spoken to Sheena.

1654
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:30,082
There are many ways.

1655
01:56:30,166 --> 01:56:31,457
You can lodge a complaint with the police.

1656
01:56:31,541 --> 01:56:33,332
There's a children's organization here
which can help you.

1657
01:56:33,416 --> 01:56:34,290
There's Sheena. There's me.

1658
01:56:34,375 --> 01:56:36,624
You don't need to waste your life.

1659
01:56:36,708 --> 01:56:39,540
Sir, my mom didn't give up on me.

1660
01:56:40,041 --> 01:56:41,707
She fought for me.

1661
01:56:42,208 --> 01:56:43,915
It's my turn now.

1662
01:56:44,083 --> 01:56:45,707
How can I desert her?

1663
01:56:45,958 --> 01:56:46,999
But...

1664
01:56:47,375 --> 01:56:48,374
what about you, Insia?

1665
01:56:48,666 --> 01:56:50,249
Why are you wasting your talent?

1666
01:56:50,333 --> 01:56:54,915
"O my heart, stop insisting."

1667
01:56:55,458 --> 01:57:00,624
"O my heart, stop insisting."

1668
01:57:00,708 --> 01:57:09,415
"Lock your cage from within,
along with your dreams."

1669
01:57:17,541 --> 01:57:19,415
"Secret Superstar!"

1670
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:24,040
"Friends, a few months ago,
a mystery girl wearing a burqa,"

1671
01:57:24,125 --> 01:57:26,832
"uploaded her songs on her YouTube channel."

1672
01:57:27,166 --> 01:57:29,249
"These videos became so popular that

1673
01:57:29,250 --> 01:57:33,582
"even celebrities and politicians appreciated
and shared them."

1674
01:57:33,666 --> 01:57:35,290
"But a few weeks ago,

1675
01:57:35,291 --> 01:57:38,040
"this YouTube channel went dormant.
No more songs!"

1676
01:57:38,125 --> 01:57:41,749
"There was silence
on her YouTube, Facebook, Twitter pages."

1677
01:57:41,916 --> 01:57:44,540
"Come Back Secret Superstar'
pages began trending,"

1678
01:57:44,625 --> 01:57:47,874
"and all her fans were upset."

1679
01:57:48,125 --> 01:57:51,332
"But today, there is reason to rejoice."

1680
01:57:51,416 --> 01:57:55,540
"Because our Secret Superstar has
set foot into the world of Bollywood."

1681
01:57:55,791 --> 01:57:59,207
"Let's talk to Shakti Kumaarr about her."

1682
01:57:59,291 --> 01:58:01,957
"Sir, tell us something
about the Secret Superstar."

1683
01:58:03,833 --> 01:58:07,207
"There's a pain in her voice that
stems from her heart."

1684
01:58:08,041 --> 01:58:11,915
"Her eyes have a passion that
transcends into her voice."

1685
01:58:12,958 --> 01:58:16,040
"She's blessed by Jesus.
She's a gifted child... gifted!"

1686
01:58:16,208 --> 01:58:17,499
"What's her real name?"

1687
01:58:17,666 --> 01:58:18,999
How does it matter?

1688
01:58:19,083 --> 01:58:20,707
Her voice is real!

1689
01:58:21,291 --> 01:58:22,915
"Will she sing more songs for you?"

1690
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,624
"God willing!"

1691
01:58:24,708 --> 01:58:27,082
'I dance!'

1692
01:58:28,125 --> 01:58:29,457
'I dance!'

1693
01:58:32,750 --> 01:58:36,874
"Your words and thoughts will flow from me."

1694
01:58:38,041 --> 01:58:42,582
"In your praise and devotion,
will I always sing."

1695
01:58:43,250 --> 01:58:48,749
"In robes weaved of your love,
I'll dress myself,"

1696
01:58:48,833 --> 01:58:52,957
"and merge into your colours."

1697
01:58:53,041 --> 01:58:54,207
Insu...

1698
01:58:58,583 --> 01:59:00,832
Mom, no more dreams for me.

1699
01:59:10,958 --> 01:59:12,874
Isn't school over?

1700
01:59:13,166 --> 01:59:14,540
No, father.

1701
01:59:14,708 --> 01:59:15,957
Today is the last day.

1702
01:59:16,083 --> 01:59:17,499
When are your exams starting?

1703
01:59:18,833 --> 01:59:20,624
From the 5th of the next month.

1704
01:59:20,750 --> 01:59:23,832
- And when do they end?
- On the 20th.

1705
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,040
Alright. I'll book the tickets
for the 20th itself.

1706
01:59:27,125 --> 01:59:28,624
Start packing.

1707
01:59:28,708 --> 01:59:31,915
Don't leave anything for the last minute. Yes?

1708
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:34,790
Bye.

1709
01:59:48,166 --> 01:59:49,415
Hi.

1710
01:59:51,458 --> 01:59:53,124
Shall I write something?

1711
02:00:04,958 --> 02:00:06,999
Are your tickets booked?

1712
02:00:07,166 --> 02:00:08,457
Insu.

1713
02:00:09,958 --> 02:00:11,457
Shall we go?

1714
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:18,124
Bye.

1715
02:00:27,250 --> 02:00:29,332
Auntie, just a minute.

1716
02:00:29,541 --> 02:00:31,999
I'm Chintan. Insia's friend.

1717
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,540
The 'pav bhaji' lunch that
you sent that day was amazing.

1718
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,124
I never let Insia eat. I finished everything.

1719
02:00:41,708 --> 02:00:42,915
Will you have ice cream?

1720
02:00:44,458 --> 02:00:45,624
No.

1721
02:00:47,791 --> 02:00:49,915
Auntie, today is the last day of school.

1722
02:00:50,333 --> 02:00:53,707
So, if you don't mind,
can Insia and I go for ice cream?

1723
02:00:54,125 --> 02:00:56,082
We'll be back in 1 0 minutes.

1724
02:00:57,083 --> 02:00:58,832
Promise. Please?

1725
02:00:58,916 --> 02:01:00,040
Please?

1726
02:01:03,250 --> 02:01:04,040
Go.

1727
02:01:04,125 --> 02:01:05,582
- Thank you, auntie.
- Huh?

1728
02:01:05,708 --> 02:01:06,499
Go.

1729
02:01:06,583 --> 02:01:07,415
Come.

1730
02:01:07,625 --> 02:01:08,665
Go!

1731
02:01:11,750 --> 02:01:12,832
Listen.

1732
02:01:17,916 --> 02:01:21,040
Father has gone to Ahmedabad.
He'll return late at night.

1733
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:23,540
You can stay out longer, come back by evening.

1734
02:01:25,625 --> 02:01:26,832
Come.

1735
02:01:31,041 --> 02:01:34,249
Babes, your song has become a superhit.

1736
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,874
Yes, sir. I've seen it.

1737
02:01:37,375 --> 02:01:39,165
It keeps coming on TV.

1738
02:01:39,333 --> 02:01:41,624
And mom has bought the CD.

1739
02:01:41,750 --> 02:01:43,415
- There's more good news.
- What?

1740
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:46,374
Glamour Awards has nominated you.

1741
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,915
- Best Singer.
- What? Really?

1742
02:01:50,166 --> 02:01:51,040
And me, too.

1743
02:01:51,083 --> 02:01:51,874
Wow, sir.

1744
02:01:51,916 --> 02:01:53,165
I can't believe it.

1745
02:01:53,333 --> 02:01:54,374
When is it?

1746
02:01:54,458 --> 02:01:57,249
On the 20th. In Mumbai. You should come.

1747
02:01:58,041 --> 02:01:58,957
No, sir.

1748
02:01:59,041 --> 02:02:01,457
I won't be able to come. You know that.

1749
02:02:01,708 --> 02:02:03,832
But, you will surely win the award.

1750
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:06,082
Ha! Fat chance.

1751
02:02:06,291 --> 02:02:08,040
No, sir. Don't say that.

1752
02:02:08,166 --> 02:02:09,749
You'll surely win.

1753
02:02:11,250 --> 02:02:12,624
Listen.

1754
02:02:14,458 --> 02:02:16,624
Don't forget about me when you go to Saudi.

1755
02:02:18,250 --> 02:02:19,332
Keep in touch.

1756
02:02:19,708 --> 02:02:21,832
How can I forget you?

1757
02:02:22,333 --> 02:02:24,207
You've done so much for me.

1758
02:02:24,458 --> 02:02:26,374
- Thank you.
- God bless, kiddo.

1759
02:02:26,500 --> 02:02:27,790
God bless.

1760
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:35,457
Don't be sad.

1761
02:02:35,583 --> 02:02:37,540
You are anyway the best singer.

1762
02:02:38,166 --> 02:02:39,790
And you, best friend.

1763
02:02:39,875 --> 02:02:41,082
Thank you.

1764
02:02:43,125 --> 02:02:44,457
Let's celebrate today?

1765
02:02:44,708 --> 02:02:45,832
What?

1766
02:02:45,958 --> 02:02:47,749
I read on twitter...

1767
02:02:48,208 --> 02:02:51,790
"Don't cry it's over, smile it's happened."

1768
02:02:51,958 --> 02:02:54,290
- You read this on twitter?
- Yes.

1769
02:02:54,875 --> 02:02:55,999
Who tweeted it?

1770
02:02:57,166 --> 02:02:58,790
Break up Quotations.

1771
02:02:59,833 --> 02:03:05,582
"At 7.30 in the morning..."

1772
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:11,040
"At 4.45 in the evening..."

1773
02:03:11,125 --> 02:03:16,749
"When the first rains fall..."

1774
02:03:16,833 --> 02:03:23,665
"When the summer holidays come to an end..."

1775
02:03:24,291 --> 02:03:27,124
"Sometimes in joy... sometimes in sorrow..."

1776
02:03:27,208 --> 02:03:31,499
"and sometimes for no reason at all..."

1777
02:03:31,833 --> 02:03:37,457
"I'll miss you. I love you."

1778
02:03:37,541 --> 02:03:43,290
"I'll miss you. I love you."

1779
02:04:16,791 --> 02:04:22,374
"Whenever I pass by your house..."

1780
02:04:22,541 --> 02:04:28,165
"I'll wait a little for you."

1781
02:04:28,250 --> 02:04:33,874
"I know, I won't see you there."

1782
02:04:33,958 --> 02:04:41,332
"I know, I'll end up getting delayed."

1783
02:04:45,708 --> 02:04:51,290
"When I have tea and cookies in the morning..."

1784
02:04:51,458 --> 02:04:56,832
"When I have cold coffee in the evening..."

1785
02:04:56,916 --> 02:05:02,499
"When your birthday comes by..."

1786
02:05:02,583 --> 02:05:09,374
"When my birthday comes by..."

1787
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:17,040
"31 st December, 14th February,
Festival of Nine Nights..."

1788
02:05:17,541 --> 02:05:23,165
"I'll miss you. I love you."

1789
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:29,999
How was the exam?

1790
02:05:30,416 --> 02:05:31,749
Good.

1791
02:05:32,833 --> 02:05:34,624
I'm going to Mumbai.

1792
02:05:34,708 --> 02:05:36,540
For the Glamour Awards.

1793
02:05:36,750 --> 02:05:38,999
Shakti sir has kept a pass for me.

1794
02:05:42,416 --> 02:05:44,457
I'll miss you, Chintan.

1795
02:05:45,541 --> 02:05:46,582
I'll miss you, too.

1796
02:05:46,666 --> 02:05:52,165
"I'll miss you. I love you."

1797
02:05:52,250 --> 02:05:58,040
"I'll miss you. I love you."

1798
02:05:58,250 --> 02:06:04,207
"I'll miss you."

1799
02:06:13,291 --> 02:06:15,415
Sir, load this too.

1800
02:06:18,208 --> 02:06:19,540
Careful.

1801
02:06:39,041 --> 02:06:41,707
I need to use the toilet. Hold this.

1802
02:06:42,541 --> 02:06:43,915
Watch the luggage.

1803
02:06:50,291 --> 02:06:52,124
Ma'am, please come.

1804
02:06:52,625 --> 02:06:54,082
I...

1805
02:06:54,166 --> 02:06:55,332
Please come, ma'am.

1806
02:06:58,500 --> 02:07:01,040
Madam, my husband has gone to the toilet.

1807
02:07:01,125 --> 02:07:02,249
He'll be back in two minutes.

1808
02:07:02,333 --> 02:07:04,249
No problem. Please step out of the queue.

1809
02:07:04,333 --> 02:07:05,624
No... please check these.

1810
02:07:05,708 --> 02:07:08,249
Mom, don't worry. I'll take care of it.

1811
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,749
From here to Mumbai, then Mumbai to Riyadh.

1812
02:07:10,833 --> 02:07:14,540
You'll get the boarding passes to Riyadh
at the Mumbai International airport.

1813
02:07:14,625 --> 02:07:17,915
You'll have to check in your bags again
at Mumbai airport.

1814
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,124
Okay.

1815
02:07:20,916 --> 02:07:22,540
I have another request.

1816
02:07:23,250 --> 02:07:25,249
These three seats together.

1817
02:07:25,333 --> 02:07:26,749
And these two seats behind them.

1818
02:07:26,916 --> 02:07:28,290
Okay, ma'am.

1819
02:07:35,166 --> 02:07:36,540
Done?

1820
02:07:43,500 --> 02:07:44,332
Come on, then.

1821
02:07:49,166 --> 02:07:50,749
It happens every time.

1822
02:07:50,916 --> 02:07:53,374
Someone takes my window seat.

1823
02:07:53,541 --> 02:07:54,374
Excuse me.

1824
02:07:54,541 --> 02:07:56,624
- Hello.
- Yes.

1825
02:07:56,708 --> 02:07:58,249
That's my seat.

1826
02:08:00,875 --> 02:08:02,249
So sorry.

1827
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:14,332
Come, take the window seat.

1828
02:08:25,500 --> 02:08:30,582
"Monali Thakur, Sudha Venkat, Geet Singhal,
have been joined this time,"

1829
02:08:30,666 --> 02:08:34,457
"by our first time nominee, Secret Superstar."

1830
02:08:34,541 --> 02:08:36,165
"For the beautiful song..."

1831
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:39,832
- Secret Superstar sings really well.
- Yes.

1832
02:08:40,208 --> 02:08:41,499
She'll definitely win the award.

1833
02:08:41,583 --> 02:08:44,540
Yes, she should win the award.

1834
02:08:46,083 --> 02:08:48,207
Where are the rest of the passengers?

1835
02:08:51,041 --> 02:08:52,332
Hello!

1836
02:08:52,833 --> 02:08:54,832
Why don't you dive into the television?

1837
02:08:55,333 --> 02:08:56,374
Come on.

1838
02:08:56,458 --> 02:08:57,707
Guddu, move to the side.

1839
02:08:57,791 --> 02:08:59,582
Stand here or you'll get hurt.

1840
02:09:00,125 --> 02:09:02,165
- Sir, this needs a fragile tag.
- Okay.

1841
02:09:02,250 --> 02:09:05,499
- These two, too.
- I'll do it. Don't worry.

1842
02:09:10,791 --> 02:09:11,999
Sir, you have extra baggage.

1843
02:09:12,083 --> 02:09:13,374
You'll have to pay for it.

1844
02:09:13,541 --> 02:09:15,207
What rubbish?

1845
02:09:15,291 --> 02:09:17,374
Every bag is under 25kgs.
I weighed them myself.

1846
02:09:17,458 --> 02:09:19,040
Sir, it is not about the weight.

1847
02:09:19,166 --> 02:09:20,832
You have an extra bag.

1848
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:24,749
You are allowed 1 0 bags
and you've checked in 1 1.

1849
02:09:25,458 --> 02:09:27,332
How much will I have to pay?

1850
02:09:27,583 --> 02:09:29,124
Sir, 4,500.

1851
02:09:40,541 --> 02:09:41,832
What's this?

1852
02:09:42,166 --> 02:09:43,582
Where has this come from?

1853
02:09:44,250 --> 02:09:45,332
It's Insu's guitar.

1854
02:09:45,416 --> 02:09:48,624
So? Are we taking her there to play the guitar?

1855
02:09:49,541 --> 02:09:52,332
When will you both stop obsessing
over the guitar?

1856
02:09:54,583 --> 02:09:58,290
Insia... pick up the guitar...

1857
02:10:01,666 --> 02:10:04,499
yes... and dump it in the dustbin over there.

1858
02:10:05,625 --> 02:10:07,582
There is no need for a guitar there.

1859
02:10:11,208 --> 02:10:13,457
You think I'll pay 5,000 rupees to carry junk?

1860
02:10:25,625 --> 02:10:27,124
Listen...

1861
02:10:27,791 --> 02:10:30,790
Insu has nothing but her guitar.

1862
02:10:30,958 --> 02:10:33,915
We are carrying so much anyways, please,
let's take her guitar too.

1863
02:10:34,041 --> 02:10:36,540
It's not a guitar, it's junk.

1864
02:10:36,666 --> 02:10:39,999
The same junk that's in both your heads.

1865
02:10:46,208 --> 02:10:49,457
It's not junk. It's Insu's guitar.

1866
02:10:57,125 --> 02:10:58,707
If you say the word 'guitar' once more,

1867
02:10:58,708 --> 02:11:02,332
you have no idea,
how hard I'll slap you right here.

1868
02:11:03,083 --> 02:11:04,165
Get it?

1869
02:11:04,791 --> 02:11:06,665
In fact, it's not even a guitar.

1870
02:11:07,666 --> 02:11:09,332
It's Insia's dream.

1871
02:11:10,541 --> 02:11:12,874
And without dreams
there's no point to anything.

1872
02:11:15,083 --> 02:11:17,374
Neither to sleep, nor to wake up.

1873
02:11:17,500 --> 02:11:20,082
Neither to live, nor to die.

1874
02:11:20,791 --> 02:11:22,582
To dream is a basic right.

1875
02:11:22,666 --> 02:11:24,374
Everyone should be allowed this much.

1876
02:11:25,708 --> 02:11:27,082
Have you lost it?

1877
02:11:27,291 --> 02:11:30,165
I've told you once that
the guitar will stay here. That's it!

1878
02:11:34,750 --> 02:11:35,999
Alright.

1879
02:11:36,375 --> 02:11:37,957
The guitar will stay here.

1880
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:42,082
Along with Insu...

1881
02:11:43,083 --> 02:11:44,582
Guddu...

1882
02:11:45,125 --> 02:11:46,457
and me.

1883
02:11:49,041 --> 02:11:51,165
We are not coming to Riyadh with you.

1884
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:52,749
Sorry.

1885
02:11:54,333 --> 02:11:55,749
Hold it!

1886
02:11:59,208 --> 02:12:01,582
There are cameras everywhere.

1887
02:12:02,250 --> 02:12:04,207
If you hit me,

1888
02:12:05,416 --> 02:12:09,207
we'll take the footage from security
and upload it on YouTube.

1889
02:12:10,291 --> 02:12:12,415
Insu has a channel on it.

1890
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:16,165
Haven't you seen it on TV? The burqa clad girl.

1891
02:12:16,458 --> 02:12:18,749
Who sings, plays the guitar.

1892
02:12:19,125 --> 02:12:20,749
She has millions of fans.

1893
02:12:21,250 --> 02:12:23,040
They'll all see you.

1894
02:12:24,208 --> 02:12:29,665
Before any of this happens,
it's best that you go to Riyadh.

1895
02:12:44,833 --> 02:12:46,915
Enough is enough! Stop this nonsense.

1896
02:12:47,166 --> 02:12:48,624
I'm your husband.

1897
02:12:48,708 --> 02:12:51,040
You can't move from here without my permission.

1898
02:12:51,750 --> 02:12:53,207
Hold this, Insu.

1899
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,082
What's happening? Can't you hear?

1900
02:12:58,208 --> 02:13:00,415
Can't you hear or have you gone deaf?

1901
02:13:00,541 --> 02:13:02,249
Why are you opening this bag?

1902
02:13:02,458 --> 02:13:03,624
What's this?

1903
02:13:03,708 --> 02:13:05,082
What file is this?

1904
02:13:05,666 --> 02:13:06,999
Can't you hear me? I'm talking to you.

1905
02:13:07,041 --> 02:13:08,082
Look...

1906
02:13:09,708 --> 02:13:11,249
What are you doing?

1907
02:13:11,833 --> 02:13:14,082
What file is this? What are you signing on?

1908
02:13:14,166 --> 02:13:15,874
What are you signing on?

1909
02:13:15,958 --> 02:13:17,499
What's this?

1910
02:13:19,166 --> 02:13:21,665
I can't read. You can.

1911
02:13:22,708 --> 02:13:25,790
It's written here that
if I complain to the police...

1912
02:13:25,791 --> 02:13:27,082
you'll be arrested.

1913
02:13:30,708 --> 02:13:32,749
You'll definitely lose the children.

1914
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,582
I might get your house, too.

1915
02:13:36,791 --> 02:13:40,249
If you get arrested,
you'll lose your job in Riyadh.

1916
02:13:40,666 --> 02:13:42,499
And your life will be ruined.

1917
02:13:43,333 --> 02:13:44,874
Why take the risk?

1918
02:13:47,166 --> 02:13:51,082
It's best you go and leave us alone.

1919
02:13:53,708 --> 02:13:55,165
Come on, Insu.

1920
02:14:02,166 --> 02:14:04,040
Sir, are you checking in?

1921
02:14:04,125 --> 02:14:05,874
Shall I prepare your boarding pass?

1922
02:14:05,958 --> 02:14:07,374
You are blocking the queue.

1923
02:14:07,458 --> 02:14:08,707
Are you going or not?

1924
02:14:08,791 --> 02:14:10,332
Excuse me, sir. I'm talking to you.

1925
02:14:10,375 --> 02:14:11,749
I can hear you!

1926
02:14:11,958 --> 02:14:13,040
I'm not deaf!

1927
02:14:15,541 --> 02:14:16,457
Najma!

1928
02:14:17,041 --> 02:14:17,999
Where are you going?

1929
02:14:18,083 --> 02:14:21,624
Listen to me.
The passports and luggage are lying there.

1930
02:14:21,708 --> 02:14:24,165
Insia, explain to your mother.

1931
02:14:24,291 --> 02:14:25,790
It's all about the guitar, right?

1932
02:14:25,875 --> 02:14:27,290
We'll take the guitar along.

1933
02:14:27,375 --> 02:14:29,665
Listen, I'm ready to take the guitar.

1934
02:14:29,750 --> 02:14:33,457
Madam, once you step out,
you won't be allowed back in.

1935
02:14:33,750 --> 02:14:35,665
What could be better?

1936
02:14:39,916 --> 02:14:41,207
Najma!

1937
02:14:42,041 --> 02:14:43,582
Listen to me!

1938
02:15:08,875 --> 02:15:10,374
But, mom...

1939
02:15:11,041 --> 02:15:12,624
what will we do now?

1940
02:15:13,125 --> 02:15:14,665
Where will we go?

1941
02:15:34,041 --> 02:15:36,749
Madam, may I use your phone to make a call?

1942
02:15:36,833 --> 02:15:38,124
It's very urgent, please.

1943
02:15:38,291 --> 02:15:39,499
One call.

1944
02:15:39,583 --> 02:15:40,957
Thank you so much.

1945
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:43,124
Insu.

1946
02:15:43,291 --> 02:15:44,915
Call Shakti Kumaarr.

1947
02:15:45,416 --> 02:15:48,415
It's the night of the awards, right?
Let's just go there for now.

1948
02:15:49,125 --> 02:15:50,957
We'll figure the rest later.

1949
02:15:53,625 --> 02:15:54,749
When will they be here?

1950
02:15:54,791 --> 02:15:56,040
Any minute.

1951
02:16:02,500 --> 02:16:03,874
How are you?

1952
02:16:04,166 --> 02:16:06,832
Ms. Mom, I'm very happy to meet you.

1953
02:16:06,916 --> 02:16:08,165
Fantastic!

1954
02:16:08,416 --> 02:16:09,832
Shakti's entry.

1955
02:16:11,041 --> 02:16:12,124
Hold it.

1956
02:16:12,166 --> 02:16:13,499
Where are your passes?

1957
02:16:14,500 --> 02:16:16,415
Don't you recognise her?

1958
02:16:16,916 --> 02:16:18,165
No.

1959
02:16:18,916 --> 02:16:20,124
Wait.

1960
02:16:21,291 --> 02:16:24,332
Oh! She's the YouTube singer.

1961
02:16:24,416 --> 02:16:26,040
Ma'am, I love your songs!

1962
02:16:26,125 --> 02:16:27,707
- One selfie, please?
- Yes.

1963
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:47,165
Yes, of course.
Let's get on with what we've been paid for.

1964
02:16:47,250 --> 02:16:49,249
Let's move on to the awards.

1965
02:16:49,583 --> 02:16:53,374
And to present the next award
for Best Singer - Female,

1966
02:16:53,458 --> 02:16:59,457
please welcome on stage,
the dashing, the melodious - Shaan.

1967
02:17:01,625 --> 02:17:03,249
Can't wait to open this envelope.

1968
02:17:03,416 --> 02:17:04,915
So, ladies and gentlemen,

1969
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:09,207
the award for
the Best Singer - Female goes to...

1970
02:17:22,250 --> 02:17:24,540
Monali Thakur.

1971
02:17:24,833 --> 02:17:25,665
What?

1972
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,249
- What rubbish!
- Congratulations, Monali.

1973
02:17:28,541 --> 02:17:29,457
It's all rubbish.

1974
02:17:29,541 --> 02:17:31,624
It's... all rigged.

1975
02:17:31,833 --> 02:17:33,040
Nonsense!

1976
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,915
- Congratulations, Monali!
- Thank you so much.

1977
02:17:46,375 --> 02:17:51,040
Ever since I was a little girl,
and used to sing on stage,

1978
02:17:51,541 --> 02:17:53,374
I had just one dream.

1979
02:17:53,875 --> 02:17:56,124
To win these awards.

1980
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:01,207
And every time I'm in the audience
and the nominations are announced,

1981
02:18:01,541 --> 02:18:05,749
I always wish that I win, not anyone else.

1982
02:18:06,875 --> 02:18:08,707
But, this time...

1983
02:18:10,083 --> 02:18:12,082
something didn't feel right.

1984
02:18:13,958 --> 02:18:17,457
Today, amongst us,

1985
02:18:18,041 --> 02:18:20,332
there's a new star.

1986
02:18:21,833 --> 02:18:27,040
And compared to her voice,
my voice seems to pale.

1987
02:18:29,791 --> 02:18:31,582
Secret Superstar...

1988
02:18:32,333 --> 02:18:36,124
if you're here amongst us today,

1989
02:18:36,583 --> 02:18:41,207
please come up, and collect your award.

1990
02:18:41,375 --> 02:18:42,832
Because I...

1991
02:18:43,875 --> 02:18:45,540
I can't accept this award.

1992
02:18:45,708 --> 02:18:46,999
Go on.

1993
02:18:47,125 --> 02:18:48,290
Go.

1994
02:18:48,500 --> 02:18:49,707
Go. They're calling you.

1995
02:18:49,791 --> 02:18:51,332
- Come on.
- Insu, go.

1996
02:18:51,583 --> 02:18:54,624
Secret Superstar, are you here?

1997
02:18:54,833 --> 02:18:56,040
Is the Secret Superstar there?

1998
02:18:56,416 --> 02:18:57,624
Secret Superstar...

1999
02:18:57,750 --> 02:18:58,999
Go.

2000
02:18:59,250 --> 02:19:00,707
Are you here?

2001
02:19:00,833 --> 02:19:02,165
She's here.

2002
02:19:02,250 --> 02:19:03,624
The Secret Superstar is here.

2003
02:19:03,708 --> 02:19:04,665
Put a spotlight on her.

2004
02:19:04,708 --> 02:19:06,207
Give her a big hand.

2005
02:19:08,666 --> 02:19:10,457
Move the jib! Cameras on her!

2006
02:19:12,166 --> 02:19:13,790
- Insu, go.
- Insu, go.

2007
02:19:13,875 --> 02:19:15,124
They're calling you.

2008
02:19:15,208 --> 02:19:16,374
Go.

2009
02:19:16,458 --> 02:19:17,582
Go.

2010
02:19:18,041 --> 02:19:19,999
Claim your window seat.

2011
02:21:04,833 --> 02:21:08,332
You all think that I'm the 'Secret Superstar'.

2012
02:21:09,750 --> 02:21:11,374
But, I'm not.

2013
02:21:14,375 --> 02:21:16,207
I was six years old...

2014
02:21:17,375 --> 02:21:19,457
mom got me a guitar.

2015
02:21:20,833 --> 02:21:22,290
How?

2016
02:21:23,666 --> 02:21:26,457
She stole money from father's wallet.

2017
02:21:27,625 --> 02:21:29,415
She had a necklace.

2018
02:21:29,625 --> 02:21:31,290
Her last one.

2019
02:21:32,666 --> 02:21:36,082
She sold that and bought me a laptop.

2020
02:21:39,541 --> 02:21:43,915
Father wanted to end my story in my mom's womb.

2021
02:21:46,666 --> 02:21:48,999
But she didn't let it happen.

2022
02:21:50,750 --> 02:21:53,499
My mother has written my story.

2023
02:21:54,833 --> 02:21:56,957
As she does today, too.

2024
02:21:59,166 --> 02:22:03,749
Singing songs, winning awards,
has always been my dream.

2025
02:22:05,708 --> 02:22:08,874
But, some people aren't allowed to dream.

2026
02:22:11,333 --> 02:22:13,332
The freedom to dream...

2027
02:22:14,625 --> 02:22:16,915
my mom gave me that, too.

2028
02:22:21,333 --> 02:22:23,874
So, who's the superstar here?

2029
02:22:24,625 --> 02:22:25,999
Me?

2030
02:22:26,708 --> 02:22:28,499
Or my mom?

2031
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:32,249
Mom...

2032
02:22:33,541 --> 02:22:35,499
You are not stupid.

2033
02:22:36,666 --> 02:22:38,499
You're a genius.

2034
02:22:40,333 --> 02:22:42,290
You are not a coward.

2035
02:22:43,250 --> 02:22:45,165
You're a fighter.

2036
02:22:49,875 --> 02:22:52,665
You aren't childish at all, mom.

2037
02:22:56,458 --> 02:22:59,082
You are the world's best mom.

2038
02:23:31,791 --> 02:23:39,290
"She's my dearest... my mom."

2039
02:23:39,750 --> 02:23:47,290
"My dearest mom."

2040
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:04,415
Friends,

2041
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:07,040
this is Shakti Kumaarr's first YouTube video.

2042
02:25:07,333 --> 02:25:10,832
And I dedicate it to the Secret Superstar,

2043
02:25:11,291 --> 02:25:13,124
whom I launched!

2044
02:25:14,208 --> 02:25:15,915
So, presenting my new song...

2045
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,415
fresh off the block... recorded yesterday.

2046
02:25:18,708 --> 02:25:19,999
Brand new.

2047
02:25:20,791 --> 02:25:22,124
Enjoy!

2048
02:25:27,791 --> 02:25:29,082
"Hit it!"

2049
02:25:49,541 --> 02:25:51,915
"I'll speak your words."

2050
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:53,749
"I'll sing your praise."

2051
02:25:53,833 --> 02:25:58,040
"I'll adorn myself
with the colours of your love."

2052
02:26:04,750 --> 02:26:06,499
"I'll dance like you."

2053
02:26:06,583 --> 02:26:08,290
"I'll sway like you."

2054
02:26:08,375 --> 02:26:12,624
"I'll adorn myself
with the jewels of your love."

2055
02:26:19,458 --> 02:26:23,040
"I dance wild and free..."

2056
02:26:23,125 --> 02:26:25,707
"I dance wild and free, for you,"

2057
02:26:25,708 --> 02:26:28,124
"my sexy lover."

2058
02:26:28,166 --> 02:26:32,749
"O, my sexy lover."

2059
02:26:32,958 --> 02:26:36,499
"O, my sexy lover."

2060
02:26:36,625 --> 02:26:40,124
"O, my sexy lover."

2061
02:26:40,375 --> 02:26:41,624
"Go for it!"

2062
02:26:56,958 --> 02:26:58,457
"Let's go."

2063
02:27:01,333 --> 02:27:03,082
"Everybody in the house,"

2064
02:27:03,166 --> 02:27:05,374
"shake, shake, shake."

2065
02:27:05,458 --> 02:27:07,374
"Shake your booty... come on."

2066
02:27:09,500 --> 02:27:13,540
"Very hot, whiskey shot,
got me high without a sip."

2067
02:27:13,625 --> 02:27:17,665
"I'm doomed now, left to lay in the fields."

2068
02:27:20,541 --> 02:27:24,332
"I've got cash, you've got lips,
let's meet and party hard."

2069
02:27:24,458 --> 02:27:28,457
"Tandoori... Manchurian...
I'll have a go at them both."

2070
02:27:28,583 --> 02:27:32,124
"I search for you."

2071
02:27:32,208 --> 02:27:37,207
"I search for you, everywhere, my sexy lover."

2072
02:27:37,291 --> 02:27:41,999
"O, my sexy lover."

2073
02:27:42,083 --> 02:27:45,624
"O, my sexy lover."

2074
02:27:45,708 --> 02:27:49,457
"O, my sexy lover."

2075
02:27:49,541 --> 02:27:50,957
"Give it to me!"

2076
02:28:09,500 --> 02:28:11,999
Superhit! It's a superhit!

2077
02:28:12,666 --> 02:28:15,165
If you enjoyed the video, click on 'like'.

2078
02:28:15,750 --> 02:28:18,374
And if you didn't, then change your taste!

2079
02:28:20,458 --> 02:28:21,624
Love you.
