1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,614
What's wrong with this city?

2
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:10,849
Somewhere there are ashes
and somewhere smoke.

3
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,591
Why doesn't someone say something?

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,418
Why do we endure smoke quietly?

5
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,957
Now it's the limit of endurance.

6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,098
Let's bring this reckless act to an end.

7
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,594
Smoking at public places is prohibited.

8
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,963
Violation will lead to penalty.

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,968
Don't smoke. Or let others smoke.

10
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,277
You will have to pay
a heavy price for smoking.

11
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,116
Who doesn't want to be happy?

12
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,912
But at what price?

13
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,553
You will have to pay
a heavy price for smoking.

14
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:52,387
Smoking is injurious for you.

15
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:57,030
And for your dear ones

16
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,707
You will have to pay
a heavy price for smoking.

17
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,387
- MK: Check

18
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,631
- Sounds good... Checking focus.

19
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:10,628
- Roll sound!

20
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,060
Ready, Ayan?

21
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,135
Yeah

22
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,900
- Great... Let's start!

23
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,972
- So... The reclusive Ayan Sanger!

24
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,438
5 years... 4 big songs...

25
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,914
...all hits and all non-film!
Congratulations!

26
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,609
Thanks... and thanks to all of you.

27
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,751
- The lyrics of your
songs are by a certain...

28
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,517
- Saba Tahyar Khan...

29
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,587
- ...and she's a lesser
known poet, right?

30
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,658
We had a very special relationship...

31
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,694
- Past tense! And now?

32
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,728
She's a really good friend...

33
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:47,401
- And all your songs hint at
unrequited loved... Does that mean...

34
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,473
No, no, no...
My love isn't unfulfilled...

35
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,137
- And still... unrequited?

36
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,976
I'd only heard of the
power of one-sided love...

37
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,949
Now I understand it.

38
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,514
Does this love have a name?

39
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,953
What kind of hug was that?!

40
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,823
- Means?
- 'Mmmmm'!

41
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,759
I wasn't aware that
hugs had standards.

42
00:05:57,156 --> 00:06:00,569
Listen... Save these sentimental
hugs for your family...

43
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,037
...not girls you're hooking up with!

44
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,402
And what was that kiss!

45
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,040
Excuse me!

46
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,947
All my ex-girlfriends say
I'm a great kisser!

47
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,679
Really... People will say
anything these clays...

48
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,949
Great Maser
ma: mu of guy are you?

49
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,927
A guilty one...

50
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:25,518
Guilty?

51
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:26,759
Why?

52
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,790
I have a girlfriend...

53
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,132
So? I've got a boyfriend.

54
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,295
And you're not guilty?

55
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,306
Look... boyfriends are like movies...

56
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,042
Some flops... some blockbusters!

57
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,247
And Dr. Faisal was
chosen by my father...

58
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,207
Won't take too long to flop.

59
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,580
Anyway

60
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,884
This was...

61
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,788
Alright...

62
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,392
No, no... lt's...done.

63
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,587
Sure?

64
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:58,992
Definitely!

65
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,060
Nice meeting you...

66
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,559
Bye!

67
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,104
Are you following me?

68
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,840
I don't know anyone here...

69
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,903
What do you want me to do?

70
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,911
Take you around like a tour guide?

71
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,549
''Hello, Party! Meet Hugh Heffner...
world's best kisser!"

72
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,118
Hello!

73
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,212
What's with the attitude?

74
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:34,921
Hello hello hello!

75
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,235
Did you feel bad?!

76
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,536
Why so touchy, baby?

77
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,765
Just... Fought with my girlfriend.

78
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,908
I fought with my boyfriend, too!

79
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:52,810
Just two lost souls
swimming in a fish bowl!

80
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:54,581
Filmy!

81
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,210
Totally! Why'd you guys fight?

82
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,716
If I tell you, you'll judge me...

83
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:03,325
Oh, I've already judged
you with that 'kiss'.

84
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:05,755
- Just tell me!

85
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,087
So... we were late for this party...

86
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:13,227
...so when I saw Lisa, I asked her why
she hadn't worn her clothes, yet...

87
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:16,171
And she said...
"l'm already dressed!"

88
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,766
No way!
Short or skimpy?

89
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,344
Both! She showed up
in a bikini, I swear!

90
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,446
Man... It's up to her!

91
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,116
You stink of male chauvinism!

92
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,179
Are you saying it's my fault?!

93
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,547
I know too many boys like you!

94
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,522
You're so judgmental!

95
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,624
Happily judgmental!

96
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,088
Now... If you're done,
can we get out of here?

97
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,258
Where to?

98
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,394
Bar hopping!

99
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,292
With me?

100
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:41,590
Well, I'm not going alone!

101
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,094
Okay, let's go!

102
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,364
<i>Mg gm!</i>

103
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,098
We haven't been properly introduced!

104
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,597
My name is Alizeh Khan...
Khan, and I'm not a terrorist!

105
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,032
Rahul...

106
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,139
...like in ''Kuch Kuch Hota Hai''.

107
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,203
Are you joking or
is that really your name?

108
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:58,713
It was a joke!

109
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,411
I don't like jokes!

110
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,980
I don't like you!

111
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,051
Name?

112
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,783
Ayan... Ayan Sanger.

113
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,584
Ayan Sanger...
It's the time to disco!

114
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,036
- Look! My girlfriend's apologizing!

115
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,775
She's apologizing?

116
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,070
Yeah... I feel bad...

117
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,141
How rich are you?

118
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,642
What does that have
to do with anything?

119
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,586
Well, it's not because
of your good looks, is it?

120
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,245
- Yew
- Sure

121
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,153
So... you're rich, right?

122
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:19,926
Yeah... I'm rich.

123
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,230
First Class or Private Jet?

124
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:26,766
Private Jet...

125
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,395
I knew it!

126
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,002
She's a gold-digger!

127
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,172
Are you poor?

128
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,312
Well, my father's rich...
I'm wealthy. Big difference.

129
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:40,649
What's the difference?

130
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,015
I'm the 4th of 4 daughters...

131
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,594
Youngest kids usually get
the most love, but not in my family...

132
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,363
My morn left me when I was 2.

133
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,258
What?

134
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:58,927
She ran away

135
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,102
Mothers are like Teresa...
yours is Usain Bolt!

136
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,336
My mom

137
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,207
rm so sorry
That's Wrong

138
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:12,912
Why did she leave?

139
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,952
I was never allowed to ask...

140
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,046
NOW

141
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,285
What difference does it make?

142
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,395
You must be close to your dad, right?

143
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,494
Yeah

144
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,074
What do you do in London, anyway?

145
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,578
<i>MEN</i>

146
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,984
You don't look the
the business type!

147
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,985
Another one of your Daddy's dreams?

148
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,486
Don't you have a dream of your own?

149
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,295
I...

150
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,363
What? ls it illegal?

151
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,727
I want to sing.

152
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,558
Sing!

153
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,974
But my voice won't help
my father's company... so...

154
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,575
Sink it, maybe!

155
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,076
- Hey!
- Sorry...

156
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:20,342
I sing really well! Lots of people
think I sing like Mohammed Rafi...

157
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,784
Shall I sing for you?

158
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,818
What did I ever do to you?

159
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:27,389
And doesn't Mohammed Rafi
always sound like he's crying?

160
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,825
What's better than crying?

161
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,788
Fm not a fan

162
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:36,628
And not of laughing, either!
I take the road less taken...

163
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,427
Which is?

164
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:39,936
Life.

165
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,562
- You talk like you're Amitabh Bachchan!
- I wish!

166
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,170
Do you do anything but talk?

167
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:51,438
Or do you rip apart
men's ego's for a living?

168
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,475
Please... I'm really busy!

169
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:57,044
Sometimes I do yoga...

170
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,389
Buddhist chanting...
I'm learning French...

171
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,390
Bollywood Dance class,
sometimes...

172
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,354
Like the wind,
I'm everywhere...

173
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:08,058
My name is registered
in any and every course.

174
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,631
But this register
has someone else's name.

175
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:11,700
Who's Ali?

176
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:12,767
Nobody

177
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,928
Hello, Ali... Who you?

178
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,366
Let me go, he's no one!

179
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,069
- Look, the train is here.
- Who is Ali?

180
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:23,638
Who is Ali?

181
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,948
My apocalypse.

182
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,485
I was studying in Lucknow
when I first met Ali...

183
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:36,290
The sexy, Smouldering, deep DJ Ali...

184
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,229
It was like music
was a part of his soul...

185
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:43,962
He was as absorbed in his music...
as I was in him.

186
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:50,596
I thought we were in love...
he never bothered to correct rne.

187
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:56,004
But, in truth,
he was the love of my life...

188
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,103
...and I was just his habit.

189
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:00,842
So, ma: happened?

190
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,249
What could happen?
He found another habit...

191
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,616
Decided that was love.

192
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,359
She was this goddamned
beautiful airhostess...

193
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,861
She showed him where
her emergency exits were...

194
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,558
Wand that was that.

195
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,099
And me and my broken
heart found our way to London

196
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,565
But you still love him?

197
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,373
That question makes me feel weak...

198
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,742
So thank God for Dr. Faisal...

199
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,547
At least he's nice to look at...

200
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,622
- Great distraction!

201
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,160
My Lisa is very, very hot.

202
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,391
What do you mean 'very hot'?

203
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,000
Very hot.

204
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,297
Wanna bet?

205
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,666
Bet what?

206
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,902
Come on...
I bet mine's hotter than yours.

207
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,906
Done! Double date... tomorrow night?

208
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:06,839
It's on.

209
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,909
What if I win?

210
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,453
Then I'll let you kiss me again...

211
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,580
But you won't win!

212
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:22,056
Shall we?
I'm very drunk...

213
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,356

00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,430
No no no rm okay, rm my

00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,910
This! This is my happy place.

217
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,448
I come here when the
world gets too much...

218
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,211
...when I want to
spend time with myself...

219
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:45,655
Because this is the only place
on earth that knows...

220
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,280
Love is crooked.

221
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,217
Crooked!

222
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,287
I'll make you an offer you can't refuse.

223
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:59,333
I see... Can you offer me
your address?

00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,923

- Yes, please.

225

No, I'm alright.

Alizeh...

251
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,731
I never asked...
How do you two know each other?

252
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,899
We're family friends.

253
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,595
Oh, but we're family friends...
I've never met him...

254
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,103
Well... He's my friend's family...

255
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,769
So... family friends!

256
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,408

How long have you'll been together?

259
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,413
How long has it been?

260
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:37,752
Honey!

261
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,060
Tomorrow is our
one-month anniversary!

262
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,694
Happy anniversary...

263
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,134

Where'd you meet?

264
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,131
- Gym!

265
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:50,569
<i>Gym</i>

266
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,707
It's a gym called 'Online'...
really good...

267
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,742
Yeah, and he was so cute...

268
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,377
He saw me going into the sauna...
and he started singing...

269
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:04,381
"Feeling hot, hot, hot!"

270
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,221
Adorable...

271
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,688
And you guys?

272
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:12,360
Well, our fathers are
very dear to one another...

273
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,199
Why not turn such
a close bond into family?

274
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,727
Wow... Urdu is so exotic...

275
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,566
Like French... but not French!

276
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,169
Because it's Urdu?

277
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:25,567
Exactly!

278
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,008
Hindi's beautiful, too...

279
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:36,684
Only when Mr. Bachchan speaks
on Who Wants to be a Millionaire!

280
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,853
She loves that show...

281
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:42,325
Yeah, I love it!
He totally nails hindi!

282
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:46,025
He used this word once...

283
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,858
'Vaatavaran'!

284
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,696
And I was like, "Oh my God!

285
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,564
I love that word!
What does it mean?

286
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,603
Ayan said it means...

287
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,398
"Vibe"!

288
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,905
So me and the girls
use it all the time...

289
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,915
I just love the
"vaatavaran" of this club...

290
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:10,380
I just love the
"vaatavaran" of this bar...

291
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,053
I just love the word.

292
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:16,124
Alizeh, you should come
out with my girlfriends some time...

293
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,485
We could do like a girly lunch!

294
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,631
I have food allergies...
and people allergies, too.

295
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,296
- You'll could go watch a movie, Alizeh!
- Yeah! You love movies!

296
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,838
Yeah, we should see a movie!

297
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:35,476
Actually, I just watched
a great French film... Priceless!

298
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,410
- I've seen it!
- Oh yeah?

299
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,345
- I really love it!
- What's it about?

300
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,784
This immoral hussy...

301
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:44,984
Prostitute.

302
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:48,287
...lures rich men for their money...

303
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,785
You know what, Lisa...
You should watch it.

304
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:52,985
I think you'll like it.

305
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,763
Wm What do you mean?

306
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:58,796
Just... It's a good film.

307
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,594
HOW dare you?

308
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,565
Honey, how dare she?

309
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,236
HOW dare you?

310
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,739
They're asking 'how dare you?'

311
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,041
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

312
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,278
I had no idea you could think...

313
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:31,157
Wow, you're even
stupider than you look...

314
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,163
Who throws red wine on black?

315
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,069
Oh my God,
I can't believe she did this to me!

316
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,140
She's a very weird, weird girl!

317
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,177
Stop touching me right now!

318
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,971
Come on; let's get a cab...

319
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,907
Baby... don't cry...

320
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,753
Okay... Who wants
some low fat yogurt!

321
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,355
Go away!

322
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,097
She humiliated me...

323
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,399
insulted me.

324
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,070
But you, Ayan...

325
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,566
...you never stand up for me!

326
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,407
I... always stand up for you.

327
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,077
I have a heart...

328
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,215
Yeah

329
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,621
I have a heart, Goddamnit!

330
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,089
Come... Come here!

331
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,654
- Open doors and open drawers!

332
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:34,588
Hi!

333
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,090
Hello!

334
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:39,694
Here Wm

335
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,223
I was just doing yoga...

336
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,365
If I may say...
your form is remarkable.

337
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,908
Where is
Mademoiselle Skimpy, anyway?

338
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,645
Lisa was really upset yesterday!

339
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,911
Why? She couldn't
find your chequebook?!

340
00:23:59,004 --> 00:23:59,812
Hey!

341
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,175
Have some respect!

342
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,649
For your boxers?

343
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:05,820
What is this?

344
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,920
It's for you!

345
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,987
To hell with Lisa!

346
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,787
'(owe Cute

347
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,499
I came to apologise.

348
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:17,633
With this?

349
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,602
What' you Wm flowers?

350
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:20,462
Yew

351
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:22,837
I hate flowers.

352
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,372
What did flowers ever do to you?

353
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,631
Flowers are so overrated!

354
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,274
Yeah, they look pretty...
smell nice...

355
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,970
...but colours fade
and scent disappears...

356
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:35,007
...and what you're left with
is lifeless, wilted and diseased.

357
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,719
Thorns, on the other hand...

358
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,884
They're not so fragile...

359
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,491
Thorns are fearless...

360
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,724
I don't want to be just a flower...

361
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,462
I want to be a thorn.

362
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,790
I want to smack you!

363
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,861
Though she be little,
but she is fierce!

364
00:24:55,126 --> 00:25:00,075
Please sir, share your gruel...

365
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,638
God, take it already...

366
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:04,009
May a thousand
Gods shine upon you...

367
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,679
You have to admit...
songs of the 80's were amazing...

368
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,285
Cheap, vulgar and extra tacky!

369
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,285
My playlist is 'Cheap Thrills'!

370
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,948
No way... mine is
'Jolly Good Bollywood"!

371
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,889
Most famous song of the 80's?

372
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,657
- Film?
- Himmatwala!

373
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,498
Cheapest song?

374
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:27,801
Film'?

375
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,597
Maqsad, 1984!

376
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,781
You're not my long
lost brother, are you?

377
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,614
No but maybe the Doctor is!

378
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:49,219
Hopefully he'll
just be long lost!

379
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,161
So... what are you
doing at 4 PM today?

380
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,956
I'm very busy...
Meetings, appointments...

381
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,090
Shut up! You're free!

382
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,496
Okay... I am!

383
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,215
- What's the problem?
- Problem?

384
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,442
I saw you busting
your moves at home...

385
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:51,612
...what's with the
dainty flailing now?

386
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,283
It's embarrassing.

387
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:54,850
Embarrassing?

388
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,221
Embarrassment is just a fancy
word for self-importance.

389
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,727
You're nobody here!

390
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:03,831
So you're not shaming
Daddy Dearest...

391
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,969
Nor are you embarrassing yourself!

392
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,434
Just dance, man!

393
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,433
I can't dance in groups... only sing.

394
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:14,506
Oh, really?
And that's amazing...

395
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,077
...but this isn't choir
practice - it's a dance class!

396
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,812
It's just not my scene...

397
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,612
Shh! Just dance!

398
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,351
Forget your inner Lois Lane...

399
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,353
...you were born to be Wonder Woman!

400
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,252
In the name of JLo's sex appeal...

401
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:36,098
...show this cruel world,
you truly are a Baby Doll!

402
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:38,359
Baby Dow

403
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,270
You're off your rocker...

404
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,208
Get ready

405
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,042
See that gm

406
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,311
Watch that Scene

407
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,450
Digging the Dancing Queen!

408
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,856
Woohoo! That was awesome!

409
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,194
You were right, I feel great!

410
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,459
Told ya!

411
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:48,262
But if you thought
this was impressive...

412
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,298
...wait 'til you hear me sing...

413
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,374
You'll be a fem

414
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,003
God

415
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:55,310
Sing!

416
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,371
- What?
- Sing!

417
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,380
- What do you mean 'sing'?
- Sing means sing... Sing!

418
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,380
- Here?
- Where else?

419
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,714
On this sidewalk?

420
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,548
Not again!

421
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,082
Why are you getting annoyed?

422
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,780
Because, Celine Dion...

423
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,330
Your self-praise is
driving me up the wall!

424
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,827
You're not taking me seriously...
My voice is a gift from God!

425
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,592
Then sing for Him!

426
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:20,768
No!

427
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,200
Don't be so attention seeking, man!

428
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,400
What if you fall in love with me?

429
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:29,674
Well, Mr. Casablanca...

430
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,141
I'll take my chances!

431
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:33,939
Come on... Sing.

432
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:35,279
No.

433
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:36,451
Not singing?

434
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,319
This is your last chance...

435
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,186
Nov

436
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,155
Okay... then get lost!

437
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:24,689
How was that?

438
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,068
Abhorrent!

439
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:29,570
Ab-what?

440
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,637
That sounded like
an ad for constipation!

441
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:33,707
Yum

442
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:36,811
Following a tune isn't singing...

443
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,172
It had no pain... no emotion...

444
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,850
- And you're an expert, so...
- I'm the audience!

445
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:45,585
There was no feeling.

446
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:51,451
Because this...
has never been broken.

447
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,554
You'll only really sing
when it does break.

448
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,597
Till then, you can do your MBA,
make some money...

449
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,032
...and leave music alone.

450
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:02,437
See you later... Bye!

451
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:43,144
Charlie Brown...
are you feeling blue?

452
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,474
Hmmm...

453
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:45,840
Hm!

454
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,714
- I knew you'd call to apologise.
- You wish!

455
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,252
No sorry, no thank you
in the bro code.

456
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:55,582
Whatever

457
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,924
Listen! I've made another
great plan for a double date!

458
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,661
No, I've had enough!

459
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,126
Just hear me out!

460
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:05,129
The plan involves not
listening to Lisa's crap...

461
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,099
...and watching you dance!

462
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:09,702
Because you're my dancing star!

463
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:10,601
What?

464
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,303
Silent Disco, bro!

465
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,372
I'm not your bro.

466
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,173
Because you're my dancing star!

467
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:17,771
<i>7</i> Bye

468
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:30,389
Hem

469
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:32,558
Excuse um

470
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,189
- Doctor!
- Hi.

471
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,798
Alizeh and I wanted to
apologise for the other day...

472
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,161
Wham Mm

473
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,328
Shush!

474
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:43,398
Thank you, Doctor

475
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,675
That's 50 Sweet

476
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:46,737
Ed Mubarak

477
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:47,841
Ed Mubarak?

478
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,379
- Today's not Eid...
- Let it go, let it go!

479
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:54,412
So! If you like the
"vaatavaran" of this place...

480
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,911
Wear your headphones

481
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,252
Switch to a channel you like...
And dance!

482
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,358
And here? an added bonus

483
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:04,986
What's this?

484
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,924
This is the nectar of love...

485
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,429
Like dreaming while you're awake...

486
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:19,505
I'll be right back.

487
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:26,938
Alizeh!

488
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:30,112
You've just disappeared!
Where have you been?

489
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,881
- In London!
- Shut up!

490
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,722
You broke up with
Ali and forgot us all!

491
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,826
- Are you okay?
- Yeah! Okay, listen...

492
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,795
may a dew song, mam

493
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,520
This EDM is making my head spin...

494
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,894
What? Here?!

495
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:45,193
Just one!

496
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:48,832
Well... I have one...

497
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,398
But it's a break up song...

498
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,070
Then for sure!

499
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,676
- Okay, tune into 4!
- Okay.

500
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:28,288
God, I have to pee!

501
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:29,855
Excuse me (herds a queue

502
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,949
I know, but I really
have to go... Please?

503
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,586
Where'd Lisa disappear?

504
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,625
Screw this, I'm going to the men's.

505
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,131
Excuse me, this is the men's loo.

506
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:46,275
I know... but sometimes even
I feel like I could be a man...

507
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,643
Doctor... Can you check my pulse?

508
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,089
- Don't cry, don't cry...

509
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:08,663
My boyfriend's a douchebag, too!
Don't cry!

510
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:15,161
I'll get us a cab, okay?

511
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,943
Tell him your address!

512
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,008
I don't want to be alone tonight...

513
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,484
Take me with you...

514
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,303
You've gone insane!

515
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,136
Ayan, get up!

516
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,280
No? Fine, go to hell!

517
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:01,743
- Bye, Ayan!

518
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:12,091
Sit there!

519
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:13,092
There?

520
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,234
Alizeh...

521
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,837
What was in that drink?!

522
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,069
Nectar of love...

523
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,933
My foot!

524
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,109
Lost my love...

525
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:33,938
My heart is shattered!

526
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:43,286
Now little pieces of my heart
are buzzing around me like flies...

527
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:03,342
Done?

528
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:08,043
Stop behaving like a spoilt child!

529
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:10,847
Someone just snatched
your favourite toy!

530
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,716
Your heart is just fine!

531
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:15,618
What do you even
know about heartbreak!

532
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,687
Sorry, only you know everything!

533
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:18,724
Listen!

534
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,790
A thousand people have
their heart broken every day...

535
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:25,524
And We been down that roam

536
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:29,332
You've never even been
in the neighbourhood!

537
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,701
You're not even in love!

538
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:35,470
You KNOW what

539
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:36,973
Come

540
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:39,970
Lie down here.

541
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,744
- Alizeh, I'm not in the mood for sex...
- I'll slap you again!

542
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:44,885
Lie down!

543
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:46,844
Lie down!

544
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:51,819
NOW

545
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,687
Does it hurt?

546
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,727
That's heartbreak

547
00:40:58,923 --> 00:40:59,594
New?

548
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:00,462
Rm okay

549
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:01,659
This is Lisa!

550
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,632
Heartbreak!
Lisa!

551
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:05,606
Heartbreak!
Lisa!

552
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:08,041
I understood, I've got it!

553
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,474
Good!

554
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,839
Now please go home!
The high must have worn off.

555
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:18,347
This is Heartbreak Hotel, my friend...
You have to be qualified!

556
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:22,479
You've driven me mad all night...
Go away!

557
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,079
There she is... Ms. Gone Girl, herself.

558
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:32,852
I'm sorry, Ayan...

559
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:35,593
I truly am.

560
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:39,691
Will you call me?

561
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,234
No.

562
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:43,835
No.

563
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,204
Jesus be with you.

564
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,743
Both of you.

565
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:57,915
Lisa!

566
00:42:58,475 --> 00:42:59,385
Lisa!

567
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:00,517
Lisa!

568
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:02,919
Ye evil shrew!

569
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:04,251
Ye wayward Wench!

570
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:08,588
May thee be attack'd by
the fireth of a thousand suns!

571
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:14,699
Burneth, thee shrew! This is the
beshrew of a wrong'd mistress!

572
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:15,926
Beshrew!

573
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,370
Beshrew?

574
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:19,038
What's that?

575
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:20,471
Curse!

576
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:24,237
Please don't curse me.

577
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,213
Be gone, evil Wench!

578
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,676
If thee ev'r showeth thy face again,
thee shall be ruin'd!

579
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,059
I'll help her with the bags.

580
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:38,322
Are you crazy?!

581
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,726
Out of here, black-hearted Wench!

582
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,723
I've been dreaming of
talking like that for years!

583
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,165
I'm having the best time!

584
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:50,103
NOW what?

585
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:51,569
New?

586
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:54,702
Now! Recovery Retreat!

587
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:56,910
Recovery Retreat?

588
00:43:57,201 --> 00:44:00,546
Recovery Retreat!
Heartbreak Holiday, dude...

589
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,817
I told Dad that I've been
hurt because of him...

590
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:05,578
...now I need to go and recover!

591
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,045
The plan is... Paris!

592
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,319
What are you doing this weekend?

593
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,820
I'm very busy... Classes,
appointments...

594
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,361
Shuddap! You're free!

595
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:17,828
Tell your father...
I've kidnapped you.

596
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:32,970
Excited!

597
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,044
Why are you so clingy?

598
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,304
What's the rating of this place?

599
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:03,307
5 stars! 3 for the hotel
and 2 for us!

600
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:07,381
1 you <i>+</i> 1 me equals 1 room?

601
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:11,375
2 hotel rooms = over budget!

602
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,055
What if you take advantage of me?!

603
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:15,715
Shut up!

604
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,357
Wow, nice!

605
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:24,132
Yeah, man! I love hotel rooms!

606
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:30,268
I wish I could live
in a hotel forever!

607
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,702
Exactly! I

608
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:35,404
New beds, new pillows!

609
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,445
New soap, new shampoo! For free!

610
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:41,942
Minibar!

611
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,382
That's not free!
You have to pay for it!

612
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:46,043
And you know what the best part is?

613
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:47,879
Room Service! I!

614
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,986
I'll find a menu.

615
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:52,427
Alizeh, have you ever had paratha and eggs?

616
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:53,789
Like you'll get that here!

617
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,085
No no...

618
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,267
That feeling I get when I eat that...

619
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:03,664
I'm getting that feeling today...

620
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:07,505
Like my heart is full.

621
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:08,932
You know?

622
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,542
I never want to lose this feeling.

623
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:17,010
I know that feeling...

624
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,715
I feel like I'm
starring in my own film...

625
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:26,788
I want to dance, I want to sing,
I want to go crazy on the streets!

626
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:29,828
Feeling hot, hot, hot...

627
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:33,368
You think I'm nuts...

628
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:36,230
No, dude... I've got
Bollywood in my blood, too.

629
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,540
I want to wear sarees
and run around mountains, too!

630
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:42,903
The hills are alive...

631
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,877
But you know ma:

632
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:47,776
I still have one
unrequited Bollywood dream...

633
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:49,111
Which one?

634
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:50,681
The airport dream.

635
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:56,120
The airport dream. For so long
I dreamed that I would be that girl...

636
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:59,456
...the one the boy chased through
the airport and confessed his love.

637
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,294
Twice I thought he'd come...

638
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,226
Both times I waited for him...

639
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:06,562
And both times, he didn't come.

640
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,528
Mademoiselle, we are Private Jet
people. We don't have airport dreams.

641
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,371
We're young,
we're free and you're in Paris...

642
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:18,002
...with the future Mohd. Rafi!

643
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,538
What's your point, dude?

644
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:55,199
- Now?!
- Now what?

645
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:56,537
Wan?

646
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,372
Warm

647
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:00,473
Wait for it...

648
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,729
Oi, Hero!

649
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:24,829
Come up!

650
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:25,869
Help!

651
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,307
Do you know how to tie a saree?

652
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,041
I know how to take it off...

653
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:34,874
Disgusting...

654
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:38,086
'Now, let's learn how
to tie a simple saree...'

655
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:42,688
'Ensure your petticoat
and blouse are matching...'

656
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:46,227
Now, this is how to
start draping a saree...

657
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:47,858
Okay?

658
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:48,691
<i>Away</i>

659
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:54,269
Alizeh, if I go around you again...
we'll have to get married!

660
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:56,095
Just shut up.

661
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:14,179
I'll slap you!

662
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:21,563
Start pleating like so...
and tuck it in.

663
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,267
Sexy...

664
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:33,432
Not sewer than you

665
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,475
<i>snag ready</i>

666
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,606
And so am I!

667
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,120
My morning prayer!

668
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,696
Are you serious?

669
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:05,157
Do you even see what I'm wearing?!

670
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:07,029
MON

671
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:11,069
Get up now! Come on!

672
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,499
Where: my Jacket?

673
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:18,674
You know, you're useless!

674
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:23,247
Dude... Bollywood people are nuts!

675
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,885
It's too freaking cold for romance!

676
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:28,083
Come on in!

677
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:38,692
You should be called Henessy,
not Alizeh.

678
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:40,866
Cognac's not really liquor.

679
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:42,764
Of course it is! Give it here!

680
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:57,317
You really like me...

681
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,218
You really like me.

682
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:07,525
Like really, really, really like rne.

683
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:10,156
Don't lie... because I've noticed.

684
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:11,659
Yeah

685
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:13,529
I really like you!

686
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,500
Why? Quick, tell me.

687
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,105
I don't know, man...

688
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:20,574
The first time we met...

689
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:22,507
...when we spent the night talking...

690
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:29,242
I just got the feeling
that you're my friend...

691
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,086
My best friend...

692
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,422
...and always will be.

693
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:35,946
I don't know...

694
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:45,232
You know, I wasn't popular in school...

695
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:49,728
They thought I was a weirdo,
freak, introverted...

696
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,569
And honestly, it made no difference...

697
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:55,601
You know Wm

698
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:01,882
Because I knew I was
holding on to my personality...

699
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:05,216
I was waiting to find that one person...

700
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,555
...who got my weirdness.

701
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:19,098
So... best friend, huh?

702
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:23,194
Bestest friend!

703
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:29,841
And... you're not attracted to me?

704
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:33,870
No...

705
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:42,713
What's wrong?

706
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,523
Ego's a bit bruised...

707
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:58,562
Are you attracted?

708
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:00,333
Like...

709
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:02,240
...a lot?

710
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:07,274
Not a lot... But... yeah I am.

711
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:18,218
Don't feel weird...
I don't love you or anything.

712
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:20,524
No, no... I know that.

713
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:28,730
You know,
I'm really happy we're friends...

714
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:36,438
I feel that sometimes
lust just kills friendship...

715
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:39,903
Love is passion...

716
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:43,217
...but friendship is peace.

717
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:49,754
And I never, ever want
to lose the peace between us.

718
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,753
Girlfriend, boyfriend, husband, wife...

719
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:56,686
when those relationships die...
the people just leave.

720
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:04,634
And I never want to leave you, Ayan...

721
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:08,873
- Never?
- Never

722
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,816
Wow, I feel all mushy...

723
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,044
What do I do?

724
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:22,312
Go ahead

725
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:25,057
I'm feeling a little mushy, myself...

726
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:27,659
Give me a hug...

727
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,285
I've decided that...

728
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:58,425
What?

729
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:01,719
I've decided we're
staying here another week!

730
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:06,997
Oh, no... I'm really busy...
Meetings, appointments...

731
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,067
Shuddap! You're free!

732
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:10,303
Okay, I am!

733
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:13,167
- So good?
- Yes, poopie! Yes!

734
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:19,504
Can we get two beers and
something to eat... like peanuts...

735
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:22,044
Peanuts you know, peanuts?

736
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,845
Kidding... just beer, please!

737
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:26,712
Stop staring and pay!

738
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,936
Ayan, I need to go...

739
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,036
I need to get out of here...

740
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:57,911
You can stay if you want,
I just need to go.

741
00:58:58,067 --> 00:58:59,603
One sec, I'll organize the plane...

742
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,478
I'll walk home if I have to,
I just need to go right now!

743
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:10,020
Where's my stuff?

744
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,893
This room is such a mess...

745
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,874
Alizeh are you okay?

746
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:29,235
Alizeh... are you alright?

747
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:30,406
<i>Are you okay, Alizeh?</i>

748
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,377
I'm fine, Ayan! Just stop- I'm fine!

749
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:34,871
Fm firm

750
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:37,376
Fm firm

751
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:44,857
He can't come back...

752
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:48,262
I don't want to see him.

753
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:53,765
He was gone.
I erased every trace of him...

754
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:59,104
He can't come back,
do you understand?

755
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:29,599
Yeah, Captain...
Terminal FBO 4, right?

756
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:33,739
Okay... 45 minutes.

757
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:35,369
Thank you so mum

758
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,543
Alizeh... Alizeh!

759
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:39,736
Sir, please!
She doesn't want to talk to you!

760
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:41,311
Who the hell is this?
Your lover?

761
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:42,940
- I'm her friend.
- I wasn't speaking to you!

762
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:44,314
Well, she doesn't
want to speak to you!

763
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:47,116
Stay out of it, man!
This is between us!

764
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:49,219
Sir, please!

765
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:50,653
- Hands off!
- Or else?

766
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,555
Stop it! Stop it!

767
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,653
Stop it!

768
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:03,761
I love you, Alizeh...

769
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:07,966
Come on, Alizeh.

770
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:11,377
I know I made mistakes, but
how much longer will you punish me...

771
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:17,916
You can't just out me out
of your life after all these years...

772
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:31,728
Come on, let's go...

773
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:35,526
Alizeh, please give me a chance...

774
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:37,198
Ayan...

775
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:40,740
Go.

776
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:44,711
Go...

777
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:49,540
Okay, I'm right here... I'll wait...

778
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:50,944
No, Ayan...

779
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:52,779
Go...

780
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:54,911
To London?

781
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,396
Alizeh, the plane won't come back for you...

782
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:06,166
I'll find my way...

783
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:09,165
<i>away</i>

784
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:14,598
Take care

785
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,893
Ever been suddenly slapped?

786
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:47,867
That's love.

787
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:52,609
And it only hits you harder,
when there's someone else involved...

788
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,444
Why is there ever someone else?

789
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,887
- Hello?
- Ayah?

790
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,028
Alizeh! Hi!

791
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:15,936
Where are you?

792
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:19,363
Where are you?!
I've been calling you for days!

793
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:22,942
Please leave a message
after the tone...

794
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:25,102
Please leave a message...
Even your voicemail's full!

795
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:26,804
Where are you?!

796
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:28,481
In Lucknow...

797
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:31,483
Lucknow...why?

798
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:33,545
I'm here with Ali...

799
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:37,614
Ali... Right...

800
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,922
Same flight...

801
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:42,124
Passenger seat

802
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:44,323
Together Same mam

803
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:48,233
- What are you saying?!
I'm with Ali...

804
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:50,302
Did you sleep with him?

805
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,665
- Ayan! What?!

806
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:53,632
Don't lie to me...

807
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:54,941
I know you had sex with him.

808
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:57,133
He's your lover now...

809
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:58,443
Boyfriend...

810
01:03:58,568 --> 01:03:59,638
Back together

811
01:03:59,902 --> 01:04:01,404
Are you drunk?!

812
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:02,880
You're the one who's drunk!

813
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:07,253
You said you never
wanted to see him again!

814
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,489
I know, Ayan...

815
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:12,683
But people in love are liars.

816
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:15,123
This isn't love... it's weakness!

817
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:17,495
Ali's my weakness...

818
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:24,465
Alizeh, he's going to leave you.

819
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:27,163
Then don't call me...
I'm very busy!

820
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,466
I know you're being protective...

821
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:31,201
You're a goddamn fraud!

822
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:32,845
Fake! Liar!

823
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:36,276
You can say ma: you Wm

824
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:39,544
<i>But</i> I <i>love him...</i>

825
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:42,956
- I can't help it...
I really love him.

826
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:45,481
<i>7 He's very sorry</i>

827
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:46,556
- He even cried!

828
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:48,356
But Alizeh, I cry all the time...

829
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,699
Where do you fit
in to all of this?!

830
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:52,861
Yeah

831
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:54,992
What does it have to do with me?

832
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:57,903
Ayan, listen... It's important.

833
01:04:58,494 --> 01:05:02,067
Ali's going on tour for a year...
and he wants me to go with him.

834
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:04,974
- He wants to marry me and...

835
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:06,975
<i>7</i> he proposed

836
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:08,846
What mu you say

837
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:10,646
- Yes, what else?!

838
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:15,220
- Mum and Dad have kicked me out...

839
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:19,586
...they won't come for
the wedding, either...

840
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,659
- Some of Ali's useless cousins
will be at the wedding...

841
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:26,762
- Will you come from my side...
For me?

842
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,764
I don't have a visa...

843
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,870
- Yo, Mr. Britain!
I'll organize all of that...

844
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,669
- So... You'll come?

845
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:39,541
Hello? Ayah?

846
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:41,648
<i>A? am?</i>

847
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,450
Of course I will!

848
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,450
Thank you, man

849
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:48,717
- Dude, I love you...

850
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:50,615
- Say congratulations!

851
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:31,778
Hi, bro!

852
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:44,581
Alizeh...

853
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:46,185
Weds...

854
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,251
Ayan!

855
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,499
Ayan!
You're spinning like a top!

856
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:29,649
You're seriously like Mohd. Rafi!

857
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:32,850
I was wrong about you, man!

858
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:34,857
You really can sing!

859
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:42,168
Forget this MBA...
Follow your dreams!

860
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:44,869
Not like you can't afford to!

861
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:46,538
Today you sang with such...

862
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:47,800
Pain?

863
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:00,179
Love?

864
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:02,754
Ayan

865
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,687
Tell me, Alizeh...

866
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:08,454
Did I sing with love today?

867
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:13,297
Who was it for?

868
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:18,703
Who was it for...

869
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:21,138
Should I tell you?

870
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:23,735
- No...
- But you must know.

871
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:27,042
I love you, Alizeh.

872
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:30,210
I love you...

873
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:33,110
I'm madly in love with you.

874
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:40,016
And now, it's too late...

875
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:51,498
Now, I want that DJ Ali
to die in the wedding procession...

876
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:55,340
And from that shock,
I want you to die, too.

877
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:01,007
If I can't have you, no one can.

878
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:05,913
Ayan. .. Please...

879
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:07,677
Please, Ayan!

880
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:12,588
You want to know what it feels like?!

881
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:18,692
I'll show you...

882
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:20,430
Ayan!

883
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:23,128
Alizeh...

884
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:26,499
Alizeh...

885
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:27,436
Alizeh...

886
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,006
Alizeh...

887
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:30,140
Alizeh...

888
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:31,208
Alizeh...

889
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,275
Alizeh...

890
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:33,172
Alizeh...

891
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:34,804
Alizeh...

892
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:45,223
May death do you'll part, Mrs. DJ Ali...

893
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:47,785
Have a great We

894
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:50,729
It's all good.

895
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:21,942
May I sit here?

896
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:24,013
My wife's sitting there.

897
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:27,853
I don't see anyone.

898
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:33,855
Excuse me, ma'am...

899
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,627
May I sit there?

900
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:41,400
Yeah, sure

901
01:17:42,457 --> 01:17:43,800
Thank you

902
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:49,031
Hello!

903
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:50,607
Hello.

904
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,274
Grapes?

905
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:02,352
There are a lot of empty seats...

906
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:07,852
But I don't want to be alone.

907
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:13,395
I was at a wedding...

908
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:15,034
My best friend's wedding!

909
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:18,598
I left that halfway.

910
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:21,639
Book or the wedding?

911
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:25,069
Both

912
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:31,408

913
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:34,285
British Passport!

914
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:37,785
I was born in England. You too?

915
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:40,925
Same pinch...

916
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:44,920
I'm on my way to Frankfurt... Via Dubai.

917
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:47,399
You?

918
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:48,794
Vienna.

919
01:18:49,424 --> 01:18:50,562
Via Dubai?

920
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:54,599
Same pinch!

921
01:18:57,132 --> 01:19:00,204
So what's up?
What do you do?

922
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:03,511
Write .

923
01:19:04,206 --> 01:19:06,914
Nice to meet you, Ms. Wright.
I'm Ayan.

924
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:09,254
I write poetry.

925
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:11,390
My name is Saba.

926
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:13,358
Oh!

927
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:23,602
Too good

928
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:25,199
We'll chat on the flight...

929
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:28,397
Wan 'm you hear
some of my stones

930
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:29,970
What's up?

931
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:33,872
Chatter is a fool's pursuit.

932
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:38,584
Your eyes can't hide
what your words conceal.

933
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:48,792
Why we your tears?

934
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,727
Don't imprison them...

935
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:55,762
Let [hem be free

936
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,285
rm very sad

937
01:20:44,406 --> 01:20:46,010
- That's me
- That's me

938
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:49,183
Listen, it was really
amazing meeting you...

939
01:20:49,444 --> 01:20:50,479
Thanks for listening...

940
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:53,492
And sorry... I think...
I fell asleep, talking.

941
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:55,386
Well, you were even
talking in your sleep...

942
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:57,019
Shit! What did I say?

943
01:20:57,285 --> 01:20:58,229
Relax.

944
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:02,925
Ayan...

945
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:06,565
I know words can't always
heal soars that run so deep...

946
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:09,766
But words are all I have...

947
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:12,443
So here, this is for you!

948
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:15,081
I hope it helps a little...

949
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:17,943
And if words aren't your thing...

950
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:20,011
Maybe the number Wm new

951
01:21:21,343 --> 01:21:22,651
Have a nice flight.

952
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,783
Thank you! Same to you!

953
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:29,413
People always say
heart over mind...

954
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:32,091
But when [he heart breaks

955
01:22:33,014 --> 01:22:35,756
Shouldn't you follow your mind?

956
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:47,967
Hem)?

957
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:51,133
- Chatter is a fool's
pursuit... or so I've heard...

958
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:53,506
- But old habits die hard...

959
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:57,213
I've been rather
impatient for this call...

960
01:23:02,544 --> 01:23:03,545
Hem)?

961
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:05,822
Sorry, my cheeks are turning pink...

962
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:08,923
You make me blush...

963
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:12,398
It's true, though...

964
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:15,965
You've told me
everything about you...

965
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:18,569
...and you know nothing about me...

966
01:23:20,362 --> 01:23:22,467
<i>7</i> Why do you mm rm here?
<i>7</i> Where?

967
01:23:23,431 --> 01:23:24,466
Vienna...

968
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:27,143
What are you doing here?

969
01:23:27,902 --> 01:23:30,007
Crossed the boundary
to cross some boundaries...

970
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:33,352
That's tough

971
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:36,181
- I can handle tough...

972
01:23:36,444 --> 01:23:40,017
Get to work, then...
See you tonight at 8?

973
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:41,150
- I'll send you the address...

974
01:23:41,249 --> 01:23:42,853
Okay... Of your house, right?

975
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:44,291
You wish...

976
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:31,857
Good morning...

977
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:32,921
Morning...

978
01:26:32,987 --> 01:26:34,398
Slept well?

979
01:26:34,589 --> 01:26:35,659
Hmm

980
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:39,304
I made breakfast for myself,
I hope you don't mind...

981
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:42,439
I'd have made you some...

982
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:44,902
But I didn't know
what you'd like.

983
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:47,272
You know nothing about me.

984
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:49,472
I got to know quite
a bit last night...

985
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:52,450
Passion isn't familiarity...

986
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:56,681
I'm blushing again...

987
01:26:58,346 --> 01:26:59,825
Change of topic!

988
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:01,958
I read some of your poetry...

989
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:05,028
It's beautiful.

990
01:27:10,325 --> 01:27:13,272
Glad you liked them...

991
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:17,233
I don't get much
appreciation for my poetry...

992
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:21,369
There's so much angst in your poems...

993
01:27:23,171 --> 01:27:25,879
Angst will always find angst...

994
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:28,482
Can I steal it for my music?

995
01:27:30,445 --> 01:27:32,652
Careful...
I have an excellent lawyer...

996
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:34,988
He didn't even spare
my ex-husband!

997
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:36,886
Divorced!

998
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:38,597
Why so pleased?

999
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:40,424
Of course!
You're single...

1000
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:42,327
Happily divorced...

1001
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:44,267
... and I have no regrets...

1002
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:46,972
Tahir and I are very good friends.

1003
01:27:47,695 --> 01:27:49,971
Every poetess should
marry at least once...

1004
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:53,576
A happy marriage means
a good life...

1005
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:57,680
an unhappy one means
good poem

1006
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:00,552
By the way, I was kidding...

1007
01:28:00,675 --> 01:28:03,622
If you need my poetry...
Go ahead.

1008
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:05,889
Thanks

1009
01:28:06,414 --> 01:28:08,416
...but what I need is you.

1010
01:28:09,917 --> 01:28:12,090
I don't want to be needed...

1011
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:14,424
I want to be desired.

1012
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:23,131
You're relentless...

1013
01:28:23,398 --> 01:28:24,638
Like a walking-talking Ghalib...

1014
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:26,211
... what am I supposed to say?

1015
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:29,776
Your silence said
more than enough...

1016
01:28:30,772 --> 01:28:31,773
Don't worry...

1017
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,716
I have no room for
a relationship in my life...

1018
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:37,285
Not anymore

1019
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:41,388
There's more than
one kind of relationship...

1020
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:45,456
...but only if you're up for it.

1021
01:28:48,623 --> 01:28:50,466
What are the rules like?

1022
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:52,600
Easily broken...

1023
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,234
So you get my poetry...

1024
01:28:57,732 --> 01:28:59,769
The chance to drown your sorrows

1025
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:03,038
What do I get?

1026
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:06,744
I thought I was enough.

1027
01:32:05,586 --> 01:32:09,295
"I seek the truth that
pierces the darkest night..."

1028
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:13,897
"I seek the devotion
I surrendered in your stead..."

1029
01:32:14,228 --> 01:32:16,936
''I have known the virtue that surrender proffers...''

1030
01:32:17,131 --> 01:32:20,305
"But I seek that heaven
for which I have bled."

1031
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:29,403
ls this supposed to be good?

1032
01:34:29,897 --> 01:34:31,535
I don't get <i>it...</i>

1033
01:34:33,734 --> 01:34:35,611
Didn't you say he was world famous?

1034
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:37,542
He is...

1035
01:34:38,139 --> 01:34:41,382
People really admire his work...

1036
01:34:42,243 --> 01:34:43,654
And you?

1037
01:34:48,382 --> 01:34:49,622
'(owe awkward

1038
01:34:51,419 --> 01:34:52,591
A We

1039
01:34:57,058 --> 01:34:58,969
You can leave, if you like...

1040
01:34:59,627 --> 01:35:01,265
And leave you alone with him?

1041
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:03,534
No My

1042
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:05,678
I'm dying to meet your ex-husband.

1043
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:11,775
How come?

1044
01:35:13,107 --> 01:35:14,279
Just...

1045
01:35:18,579 --> 01:35:19,785
- Tahir...
- Hi...

1046
01:35:21,449 --> 01:35:25,056
Your Faoebook tells me
too many things have changed...

1047
01:35:25,286 --> 01:35:26,856
Like the colour of your walls...

1048
01:35:27,354 --> 01:35:29,300
and [he dawn [0 your heart

1049
01:35:30,357 --> 01:35:31,233
Ayan.

1050
01:35:32,526 --> 01:35:33,436
Fantastic work, sir!

1051
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:35,700
Sir? Really... Sir?!

1052
01:35:36,263 --> 01:35:38,869
Are you trying to
make me sound old?

1053
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,244
By the way, he doesn't
call you ma'am does he?

1054
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:44,110
- You think?!
- I don't know!

1055
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:49,978
So you're the one...
who's keeping her up at night...

1056
01:35:50,144 --> 01:35:52,556
Why waste time on sleep?

1057
01:35:53,147 --> 01:35:55,957
Sleep is critical...

1058
01:35:56,817 --> 01:35:58,888
... for her to dream about me?

1059
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:00,494
Oh, now I definitely
won't let her sleep.

1060
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:02,158
I can't see this...

1061
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:04,561
Change of topic!

1062
01:36:06,327 --> 01:36:10,002
Besides, you've fulfilled
your dreams...

1063
01:36:10,197 --> 01:36:12,871
Your new work is very interesting.

1064
01:36:12,933 --> 01:36:14,674
Actually, fantastic!

1065
01:36:15,903 --> 01:36:20,511
Without a lover in his arms,
what else is a man to do...

1066
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:25,449
- Do you guys rehearse these lines?
- No, totally natural!

1067
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:26,887
Ah, natural...

1068
01:36:29,583 --> 01:36:33,588
People often shroud
their fear with words...

1069
01:36:34,522 --> 01:36:37,230
Our relationship
may have changed...

1070
01:36:38,425 --> 01:36:39,927
...but the fear remains.

1071
01:36:40,861 --> 01:36:42,067
Why did it change...

1072
01:36:42,596 --> 01:36:43,631
If i may ask?

1073
01:36:43,731 --> 01:36:46,610
Maybe you should
be asking the person...

1074
01:36:46,901 --> 01:36:48,972
...whose nights are now yours...

1075
01:36:51,138 --> 01:36:53,118
People often falter...

1076
01:36:53,941 --> 01:36:55,716
...on the slippery slopes
of relationships...

1077
01:36:56,377 --> 01:36:57,549
Yeah

1078
01:37:00,014 --> 01:37:02,255
You could have shown
me a better way...

1079
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:06,189
Let the one who is lost,
find his own way...

1080
01:37:12,459 --> 01:37:14,234
I hate you.

1081
01:37:14,295 --> 01:37:16,901
A We no, a bl

1082
01:37:17,631 --> 01:37:19,872
Such hatred... so soon?
Give me a chance...

1083
01:37:19,934 --> 01:37:23,438
Hating you is
completely justified...

1084
01:37:23,771 --> 01:37:26,752
Because I still love Saba...

1085
01:37:29,176 --> 01:37:31,452
I gave your love a chance...

1086
01:37:31,812 --> 01:37:34,918
It's time for you to
give my friendship a chance.

1087
01:37:36,317 --> 01:37:37,625
Isn't that hard'?

1088
01:37:37,952 --> 01:37:38,953
- What?

1089
01:37:39,453 --> 01:37:43,196
To love someone...
who doesn't love you in return?

1090
01:37:47,962 --> 01:37:51,466
It's the most beautiful
feeling in the world...

1091
01:37:53,968 --> 01:37:56,881
- Doesn't it make you feel weak?
- Not at all.

1092
01:37:57,972 --> 01:38:01,215
There's nothing like
the power of unrequited love...

1093
01:38:01,842 --> 01:38:05,187
Unlike other bonds,
it isn't shared...

1094
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:08,319
It's mine...
and mine alone.

1095
01:38:11,652 --> 01:38:16,863
For a love like this,
I don't need Saba to love her...

1096
01:38:18,225 --> 01:38:20,432
There's no better love than that...

1097
01:38:23,497 --> 01:38:26,239
"lf you gamble in
the name of love..."

1098
01:38:26,934 --> 01:38:29,744
"Stake what you like...
what's to fear?"

1099
01:38:30,404 --> 01:38:32,782
"How wonderful if you win..."

1100
01:38:33,207 --> 01:38:37,883
"Even if you lose...
all is not lost."

1101
01:39:22,022 --> 01:39:23,524
Don't hang up!

1102
01:39:33,033 --> 01:39:33,875
Hello?

1103
01:39:34,101 --> 01:39:35,079
Hello?

1104
01:39:35,169 --> 01:39:36,170
Shit!

1105
01:39:52,853 --> 01:39:54,594
- Hello?
- Ayan!

1106
01:39:55,723 --> 01:39:57,725
Where the hell are you?!

1107
01:39:57,891 --> 01:39:59,700
I've been trying to call you forever!

1108
01:39:59,793 --> 01:40:01,272
- You blocked my number!

1109
01:40:01,328 --> 01:40:02,534
What did you think I'd do?

1110
01:40:02,696 --> 01:40:03,902
Walk you down the aisle?

1111
01:40:04,732 --> 01:40:05,767
Did you marry him?

1112
01:40:07,935 --> 01:40:08,811
Yeah... I did.

1113
01:40:08,902 --> 01:40:10,313
Congratulations!

1114
01:40:11,405 --> 01:40:13,885
Now you're Mrs. DJ Ali!

1115
01:40:14,074 --> 01:40:17,214
Must be stuck on
him like headphones...

1116
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:20,083
Ayan, stop your crap
before I hang up.

1117
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:22,726
Hello!
You don't scare me!

1118
01:40:22,883 --> 01:40:24,055
Control yourself!

1119
01:40:24,485 --> 01:40:26,226
I have a girlfriend now.

1120
01:40:26,987 --> 01:40:29,593
She's really hot!

1121
01:40:30,057 --> 01:40:31,229
- And she writes poetry...

1122
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:32,964
- You'll never get it!

1123
01:40:35,162 --> 01:40:36,334
Are you jealous?

1124
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:39,067
- I think you're jealous.

1125
01:40:42,236 --> 01:40:43,613
No, dude...

1126
01:40:44,605 --> 01:40:48,576
I'm just really glad you called.

1127
01:40:48,776 --> 01:40:51,313
Pm so nappy'

1128
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:57,995
I have to go back
to my dinner date now...

1129
01:40:58,986 --> 01:41:02,195
- Candlelit... Romantic!

1130
01:41:02,456 --> 01:41:04,436
Ayan, listen...

1131
01:41:05,626 --> 01:41:07,299
I really missed you.

1132
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:10,701
I hate you.

1133
01:41:11,899 --> 01:41:14,209
Okay...
But I missed you...

1134
01:41:17,304 --> 01:41:18,146
Bye

1135
01:41:39,159 --> 01:41:41,435
'This is Saba... My girlfriend.'

1136
01:41:42,496 --> 01:41:43,133
'Wow... '

1137
01:41:43,597 --> 01:41:45,634
'What's she doing with you?!'

1138
01:41:45,732 --> 01:41:46,904
'She's gorgeous!'

1139
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,071
'Yeah Way better than you'

1140
01:41:49,803 --> 01:41:51,305
- 'Like it's a competition!'
- 'Of course it is!'

1141
01:41:51,672 --> 01:41:55,586
'ls DJ Ali still handsome
or did my curses work?'

1142
01:41:55,742 --> 01:41:57,085
'My prayers worked!'

1143
01:41:57,411 --> 01:41:58,583
'Are you happy?'

1144
01:42:02,282 --> 01:42:03,727
'Yeah... I'm happy.'

1145
01:42:05,018 --> 01:42:07,123
'Feels like I'm finally
a part of Ali's life...'

1146
01:42:07,855 --> 01:42:10,233
'Our lives are wrapped in luggage...'

1147
01:42:11,358 --> 01:42:13,804
'And hotel rooms are home...'

1148
01:42:15,896 --> 01:42:17,102
'But it's nice.'

1149
01:42:20,033 --> 01:42:23,071
'There's the occasional
dark cloud...'

1150
01:42:23,904 --> 01:42:25,884
'But other than that,
the sun is always shining.'

1151
01:42:27,407 --> 01:42:29,216
'I'm really, really happy.'

1152
01:42:30,577 --> 01:42:32,147
'I hate you '

1153
01:42:45,125 --> 01:42:47,105
'I'm coming to Vienna!'

1154
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:48,501
'What plans?'

1155
01:42:49,563 --> 01:42:51,008
'I'm very busy...'

1156
01:42:51,098 --> 01:42:53,169
'Meetings, appointments...'

1157
01:42:53,233 --> 01:42:54,735
'Shuddap! You're free!'

1158
01:42:55,068 --> 01:42:56,274
'Okay, I am!'

1159
01:42:56,336 --> 01:42:59,476
'Saba and I would
love to host you...'

1160
01:42:59,606 --> 01:43:01,745
'...but leave that DJ Ali behind.'

1161
01:43:01,875 --> 01:43:04,617
'He has a concert,
anyway... I'll be there!'

1162
01:43:12,586 --> 01:43:14,031
"Hi!
"Hi!

1163
01:43:22,429 --> 01:43:25,273
You're dying to wait
by the window...

1164
01:43:25,933 --> 01:43:28,743
Check if she called...
Walk around restlessly...

1165
01:43:29,069 --> 01:43:31,777
You're not fooling
anyone with this pose...

1166
01:43:31,972 --> 01:43:34,145
What? Me? Why?
I'm totally chill...

1167
01:43:34,241 --> 01:43:35,481
I'm cool!

1168
01:43:36,443 --> 01:43:38,252
Someone's at the door...

1169
01:43:39,413 --> 01:43:41,051
Go She? here

1170
01:43:47,221 --> 01:43:48,291
Hi!

1171
01:43:48,455 --> 01:43:49,433
<i>Nam</i>

1172
01:43:49,556 --> 01:43:51,229
Hi... Cold outside?

1173
01:43:52,326 --> 01:43:53,566
What are you doing?

1174
01:43:53,860 --> 01:43:55,999
Didn't bring any wine?
Flowers? Thorns? Nothing?

1175
01:43:56,063 --> 01:43:56,973
Should I have?

1176
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:58,134
Saba!

1177
01:43:58,665 --> 01:43:59,439
Alizeh.

1178
01:44:01,068 --> 01:44:02,240
Welcome home...

1179
01:44:02,402 --> 01:44:04,040
- So Alizeh...
- So nice to meet you...

1180
01:44:04,104 --> 01:44:06,744
Heard so much about you...
All good things, I hope!

1181
01:44:08,342 --> 01:44:09,377
What 7

1182
01:44:09,443 --> 01:44:13,118
No... just... trying to
ease the tension!

1183
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:14,688
Get a hold on yourself...

1184
01:44:14,748 --> 01:44:17,558
The 'tension' will disappear?
Come...

1185
01:44:17,751 --> 01:44:20,391
- You know how girls can be!
- Sexist remark...

1186
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:22,864
- Not appreciated!
- Not at all!

1187
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:26,233
Give our intelligence its due!

1188
01:44:28,895 --> 01:44:29,805
Wine?

1189
01:44:29,896 --> 01:44:31,204
Maybe later...

1190
01:44:31,265 --> 01:44:32,369
Ah, okay

1191
01:44:32,432 --> 01:44:33,604
But, Saba...

1192
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:37,614
Beauty like yours often
overshadows intelligence...

1193
01:44:37,904 --> 01:44:40,885
Ask those of us who
live off our personality...

1194
01:44:40,974 --> 01:44:42,954
Beauty fades, Alizeh...

1195
01:44:43,143 --> 01:44:45,783
But Death, himself,
can't kill personality...

1196
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:49,652
Wow... So the poetry
really was yours!

1197
01:44:49,916 --> 01:44:54,092
I thought Ayan was just
copying it off the internet!

1198
01:44:55,489 --> 01:44:57,435
If it weren't for poetry...

1199
01:44:57,758 --> 01:45:00,204
...l'd have died a thousand
living deaths already...

1200
01:45:02,095 --> 01:45:03,096
Cheese?

1201
01:45:06,733 --> 01:45:10,875
Will I sound phony
if I praise you some more?

1202
01:45:11,371 --> 01:45:13,510
Not at all...
Please go ahead...

1203
01:45:13,573 --> 01:45:14,881
No judgments!

1204
01:45:15,409 --> 01:45:17,013
Pictures do you no justice...

1205
01:45:17,077 --> 01:45:19,284
You're even more
beautiful in person.

1206
01:45:21,481 --> 01:45:25,019
Oh, so those pictures
were to show you...

1207
01:45:26,053 --> 01:45:28,090
To make her jealous...

1208
01:45:28,555 --> 01:45:30,535
...but why waste
envy on the resentful?

1209
01:45:31,058 --> 01:45:31,934
Wow, Ayan

1210
01:45:32,025 --> 01:45:33,868
Saba, looks like you've
had an influence...

1211
01:45:34,127 --> 01:45:35,037
A little bit Of it...

1212
01:45:35,095 --> 01:45:36,267
A little to go...

1213
01:45:40,434 --> 01:45:41,913
Well, it's not envy...

1214
01:45:42,135 --> 01:45:44,615
But you can't sing
to a mute person...

1215
01:45:44,705 --> 01:45:46,480
...and expect them
not to feel inferior!

1216
01:45:48,542 --> 01:45:52,820
Speaking of singing...
This is my favourite song...

1217
01:45:53,046 --> 01:45:56,892
"O lover, don't ask me
to love like I did before..."

1218
01:45:57,551 --> 01:45:59,724
"O lover, don't ask me..."

1219
01:46:00,053 --> 01:46:01,589
To love like I did before.

1220
01:46:11,998 --> 01:46:12,703
Dinner?

1221
01:46:13,367 --> 01:46:14,038
Bream

1222
01:46:20,407 --> 01:46:21,750
Why didn't you bring Ali?

1223
01:46:22,876 --> 01:46:24,913
He had a concert... so...

1224
01:46:25,312 --> 01:46:27,223
DJ Ali's super busy, you see...

1225
01:46:28,882 --> 01:46:32,022
Why do you keep calling him that?
Like it's an insult...

1226
01:46:32,152 --> 01:46:33,426
Not at all!

1227
01:46:33,854 --> 01:46:37,768
Who doesn't dream of making
people dance on their fingertips?

1228
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:42,065
Alizeh, may I ask
you something personal?

1229
01:46:42,129 --> 01:46:43,904
If you don't mind...

1230
01:46:44,197 --> 01:46:45,574
Sure

1231
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:50,879
How did you not fall in love
with someone so charming?

1232
01:46:57,110 --> 01:46:58,817
Charming for you, maybe...

1233
01:46:59,045 --> 01:47:01,423
He was a big baby
when I met him...

1234
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:06,258
He cried on the streets,
cried in my arms...

1235
01:47:06,353 --> 01:47:07,696
Really?!

1236
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:11,930
Ayan... ls this a compliment
or a slight?

1237
01:47:12,225 --> 01:47:14,205
You've never cried in my arms...

1238
01:47:15,295 --> 01:47:17,673
How could I cry in your arms...

1239
01:47:19,065 --> 01:47:21,545
...when I'm so distracted by
my other feelings...

1240
01:48:05,345 --> 01:48:07,325
You got lucky, Ayan!

1241
01:48:08,081 --> 01:48:10,425
Saba's wonderful.

1242
01:48:18,024 --> 01:48:19,002
Anyway

1243
01:48:19,726 --> 01:48:21,330
- Thank you for dinner.
- Go to hell!

1244
01:48:21,995 --> 01:48:23,906
'Thank you for dinner'?!

1245
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:27,704
You're soulless!

1246
01:48:28,235 --> 01:48:30,044
Don't you have any feelings?!

1247
01:48:30,670 --> 01:48:32,741
Not jealousy, not guilt...

1248
01:48:33,039 --> 01:48:36,145
- Nothing?!
- I feel everything, Ayan!

1249
01:48:36,910 --> 01:48:38,719
But you'd never
understand if I told you...

1250
01:48:38,778 --> 01:48:40,280
You'd just misconstrue it all!

1251
01:48:41,781 --> 01:48:43,351
You're a goddamn child!

1252
01:48:43,583 --> 01:48:45,085
You've got everything!

1253
01:48:45,552 --> 01:48:47,964
Goals, passion,
a relationship...

1254
01:48:48,088 --> 01:48:49,226
Why are you still so stubborn?!

1255
01:48:49,322 --> 01:48:50,232
Because I am!

1256
01:48:50,524 --> 01:48:52,367
I'm stubborn
because it's my heart!

1257
01:48:52,726 --> 01:48:55,206
What are you going
to do about it?!

1258
01:49:02,469 --> 01:49:04,244
Why can': you we me?

1259
01:49:07,641 --> 01:49:10,781
I do love you, Ayan...

1260
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:16,022
Just not the way
you want me to...

1261
01:49:17,584 --> 01:49:18,824
Why?

1262
01:49:20,186 --> 01:49:23,030
I can't... Please...

1263
01:49:33,333 --> 01:49:35,904
- I don't want to be selfish, Ayan-
- Get lost.

1264
01:50:17,877 --> 01:50:18,947
It's over, Ayan.

1265
01:50:21,581 --> 01:50:22,787
It's over.

1266
01:50:37,597 --> 01:50:39,008
I lied...

1267
01:50:42,068 --> 01:50:43,411
First to you...

1268
01:50:46,806 --> 01:50:48,251
...then to myself.

1269
01:50:51,645 --> 01:50:54,751
I lied that I don't
have place for love...

1270
01:51:02,889 --> 01:51:06,564
I'm falling in love
with you, Ayan...

1271
01:51:09,529 --> 01:51:13,875
And today, I finally understood
that you can never love me...

1272
01:51:14,534 --> 01:51:16,639
...the way you love Alizeh...

1273
01:51:19,539 --> 01:51:21,041
And SUN

1274
01:51:22,976 --> 01:51:24,546
I love you...

1275
01:51:30,950 --> 01:51:32,122
What do I do?

1276
01:51:32,952 --> 01:51:35,660
Saba, you've always known...

1277
01:51:36,623 --> 01:51:40,332
I can't do this, Ayan...

1278
01:51:42,962 --> 01:51:46,102
I've been down this road...

1279
01:51:47,667 --> 01:51:49,237
It's broken me once before...

1280
01:51:51,337 --> 01:51:52,338
Saba

1281
01:51:53,973 --> 01:51:57,853
Please don't try to
change my mind...

1282
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:02,060
If you try...

1283
01:52:04,451 --> 01:52:06,124
I'll give in...

1284
01:52:08,455 --> 01:52:10,128
If I give in...

1285
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:14,871
I'll fall apart again...

1286
01:52:19,232 --> 01:52:22,213
We can't choose who
to fall in love with...

1287
01:52:25,205 --> 01:52:30,086
But we can choose
when to walk away.

1288
01:52:32,078 --> 01:52:33,751
Go, Ayan

1289
01:52:34,647 --> 01:52:36,058
Go...

1290
01:53:58,097 --> 01:53:59,440
Let me go...

1291
01:54:01,167 --> 01:54:02,339
Please

1292
01:54:03,770 --> 01:54:06,114
Please... let rne go...

1293
01:54:09,342 --> 01:54:11,344
I can't go on like this...

1294
01:54:15,748 --> 01:54:18,058
So I have to go, okay?

1295
01:54:18,718 --> 01:54:21,062
Okay?!

1296
01:54:23,256 --> 01:54:24,860
I have to go...

1297
01:54:30,096 --> 01:54:32,042
If I can't do it...

1298
01:54:32,098 --> 01:54:34,135
then you have to be
the stronger one

1299
01:54:35,101 --> 01:54:36,205
Okay?

1300
01:54:37,604 --> 01:54:40,881
- Okay?
- Okay...

1301
02:00:31,090 --> 02:00:33,297
Thanks
Good Job on the mm

1302
02:00:37,597 --> 02:00:38,803
Thanks

1303
02:00:55,514 --> 02:00:56,754
Hey, Ayan!

1304
02:00:57,917 --> 02:00:59,521
- Hey, Ali!
- What's up, man?

1305
02:01:00,419 --> 02:01:02,695
- Avoiding me?
- Avoid... no...

1306
02:01:03,055 --> 02:01:04,557
Congratulations...
You sang really well...

1307
02:01:04,757 --> 02:01:05,599
Thanks

1308
02:01:06,626 --> 02:01:07,900
Looks like you're doing well...

1309
02:01:08,027 --> 02:01:11,065
Well, I couldn't be
Mohammad Rafi...

1310
02:01:11,364 --> 02:01:13,708
...but I've found some
love on the internet...

1311
02:01:14,033 --> 02:01:15,137
<i>Great</i>

1312
02:01:16,168 --> 02:01:18,808
- All good, otherwise?
- Yeah, all good... Superb...

1313
02:01:23,809 --> 02:01:24,981
<i>Sorry</i>

1314
02:01:25,278 --> 02:01:27,417
I'm finding this
formality really funny...

1315
02:01:28,948 --> 02:01:32,122
The truth is that I'd been
hoping to run into you...

1316
02:01:32,385 --> 02:01:33,955
So I could beat you up...

1317
02:01:35,721 --> 02:01:38,964
You have no idea how much
I wanted to beat you up, DJ Ali!

1318
02:01:40,860 --> 02:01:41,770
Nice...

1319
02:01:42,395 --> 02:01:43,806
Why'd you feel that way?

1320
02:01:44,196 --> 02:01:45,573
Because of how you rem

1321
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,174
Your love was so strong that
mine couldn't live up to it.

1322
02:01:51,971 --> 02:01:53,780
What else have
I ever done...

1323
02:01:54,006 --> 02:01:56,452
Sang some songs...
and fell in love.

1324
02:01:57,943 --> 02:01:59,286
'(owe fortunate

1325
02:02:00,079 --> 02:02:03,390
Not everyone can love
so faithfully...

1326
02:02:06,485 --> 02:02:07,759
How's Alizeh doing?

1327
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:16,239
You're serious?
You don't know?

1328
02:02:16,729 --> 02:02:18,231
I don't know... what?

1329
02:02:21,367 --> 02:02:22,778
Congratulations, man...

1330
02:02:23,002 --> 02:02:24,310
She left me.

1331
02:02:32,812 --> 02:02:35,292
Maybe I couldn't love
her the way she wanted me to...

1332
02:02:36,382 --> 02:02:37,986
I haven't seen her in two years...

1333
02:02:39,018 --> 02:02:41,328
Even her parents
haven't heard from her.

1334
02:02:41,654 --> 02:02:45,966
Last I heard, she was in London,
but I don't have the details...

1335
02:02:47,259 --> 02:02:48,932
Why didn't she call you?

1336
02:03:06,679 --> 02:03:09,387
Everyone knows love is crooked...

1337
02:03:09,949 --> 02:03:12,395
But to find peace
in that crooked love...

1338
02:03:12,551 --> 02:03:14,258
...is a gift only few have.

1339
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:15,896
- This?!'

1340
02:03:16,255 --> 02:03:18,064
'This is my happy place!'

1341
02:03:19,125 --> 02:03:21,401
And when there's nothing left...

1342
02:03:22,228 --> 02:03:24,936
...they find shelter in that crookedness...

1343
02:03:25,431 --> 02:03:29,072
'I come here when the
world gets too much...'

1344
02:03:30,069 --> 02:03:31,377
Crooked love.

1345
02:03:31,570 --> 02:03:34,642
'When I want to spend
time with myself...'

1346
02:03:35,107 --> 02:03:38,953
'Because this is the only
place on earth that knows...'

1347
02:03:39,044 --> 02:03:40,887
'...that love is crooked...'

1348
02:03:41,547 --> 02:03:42,548
'Crooked '

1349
02:04:59,124 --> 02:05:00,159
Ayan?

1350
02:05:04,163 --> 02:05:05,335
Ayan?

1351
02:05:14,773 --> 02:05:15,843
Hi!

1352
02:05:28,754 --> 02:05:29,960
Where have you been?!

1353
02:05:30,322 --> 02:05:32,029
Where the hell were you?!

1354
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:36,633
Where the hell were you?!

1355
02:05:36,962 --> 02:05:39,738
No one has a clue where you are...

1356
02:05:40,299 --> 02:05:41,801
Who are you?

1357
02:05:42,735 --> 02:05:45,079
Malaysian Airlines?

1358
02:05:45,137 --> 02:05:48,414
You think it'll make a
difference if you disappear?!

1359
02:05:49,441 --> 02:05:51,921
I've been lying here for
2 days like a homeless man...

1360
02:05:52,044 --> 02:05:53,717
I'm frozen through!

1361
02:05:53,812 --> 02:05:56,918
This is the cone and
this is the ice cream!

1362
02:05:57,816 --> 02:06:00,558
Haven't eaten, haven't slept...
Not used the loo for any business!

1363
02:06:00,686 --> 02:06:02,597
What if you'd showed up?!

1364
02:06:02,688 --> 02:06:04,725
- Where the hell were you?!
- Slap you!

1365
02:06:10,796 --> 02:06:12,366
Why'd you shave your head?!

1366
02:06:17,903 --> 02:06:19,246
Why are you new

1367
02:06:20,072 --> 02:06:21,710
I'm dying, you idiot!

1368
02:06:26,111 --> 02:06:27,055
Means?

1369
02:06:30,549 --> 02:06:32,927
What?!

1370
02:06:36,255 --> 02:06:37,427
At least give me a hug!

1371
02:06:46,532 --> 02:06:48,068
Dying means what?

1372
02:06:48,701 --> 02:06:50,374
What do you mean dying?!

1373
02:07:01,480 --> 02:07:03,289
Love is like cancer.

1374
02:07:04,450 --> 02:07:06,327
Comes without warning...

1375
02:07:06,785 --> 02:07:08,787
...and destroys you in its wake.

1376
02:07:10,923 --> 02:07:13,233
This can't be happening, Alizeh...

1377
02:07:16,228 --> 02:07:19,573
Well. .. It's happened.

1378
02:07:25,304 --> 02:07:28,308
I thought I was so cool...

1379
02:07:30,009 --> 02:07:32,819
Love turned me
into such a loser.

1380
02:07:36,482 --> 02:07:39,156
Ali was making me act insane...

1381
02:07:39,551 --> 02:07:42,532
From checking his phone,
to following him around...

1382
02:07:43,856 --> 02:07:47,668
- I'd stopped being his wife
to act like a parole officer.

1383
02:07:49,528 --> 02:07:51,906
I can't even really complain...

1384
02:07:55,034 --> 02:07:57,708
I was even willing
to overlook the cheating...

1385
02:07:59,705 --> 02:08:01,150
Thankfully...

1386
02:08:01,974 --> 02:08:05,148
I finally gathered the
last shreds of my dignity...

1387
02:08:07,613 --> 02:08:08,887
Wand left him.

1388
02:08:09,748 --> 02:08:13,059
- I decided that my husband does
not control my self-worth.

1389
02:08:13,318 --> 02:08:19,234
All that anger, hatred,
balled up in my throat...

1390
02:08:21,527 --> 02:08:24,303
I dismissed it as an
effect of the circumstance...

1391
02:08:25,564 --> 02:08:27,737
The doctors called it cancer.

1392
02:08:27,933 --> 02:08:30,072
- Straight to 4th stage!

1393
02:08:31,070 --> 02:08:36,884
I never even scored
that high in school, man!

1394
02:08:38,811 --> 02:08:40,882
But look at you!

1395
02:08:41,346 --> 02:08:45,590
You've gone from just
Ayan Sanger to Mr. Ayan Singer!

1396
02:08:48,887 --> 02:08:53,165
If you even think of dying...
I'll kill you.

1397
02:08:55,427 --> 02:08:59,102
Now that you're here...
I don't ever want to die.

1398
02:09:46,612 --> 02:09:47,784
So, ma: Wm you have?

1399
02:09:47,913 --> 02:09:51,258
Hi... Just some muesli
with strawberries, please.

1400
02:09:51,316 --> 02:09:53,853
- Muesli with strawberries...

1401
02:09:53,986 --> 02:09:55,761
<i>7</i> And how about you?

1402
02:09:56,355 --> 02:09:57,459
Same!

1403
02:09:57,923 --> 02:09:59,266
- Okay!

1404
02:10:10,636 --> 02:10:13,276
Oh, nothing...
Just donated my hair online...

1405
02:10:14,206 --> 02:10:16,186
iBhakti.com?

1406
02:10:16,608 --> 02:10:20,112
May this bald head shower
you with blessings...

1407
02:10:21,980 --> 02:10:22,981
Cool.

1408
02:10:35,928 --> 02:10:37,305
Seriously?

1409
02:10:38,297 --> 02:10:41,176
You call that a reaction?
So low-key?

1410
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:46,481
Alizeh, I just donated my hair...
And you're giving me an lrfan Khan stare?

1411
02:10:47,472 --> 02:10:49,645
A little over-the-top won't hurt!

1412
02:10:50,342 --> 02:10:52,447
Ayan, have you gone nuts?

1413
02:10:53,345 --> 02:10:55,052
Take a look at yourself!

1414
02:10:56,481 --> 02:10:58,392
You look hot, man!

1415
02:10:58,884 --> 02:10:59,794
Hon

1416
02:11:00,352 --> 02:11:03,731
You'll be fighting girls off...
We'll have to call security!

1417
02:11:06,558 --> 02:11:08,003
Seriously?!

1418
02:11:09,628 --> 02:11:11,437
- Really?!
- Yeah!

1419
02:11:13,966 --> 02:11:16,412
- Should I come there to try my luck?
- Come on over!

1420
02:11:20,539 --> 02:11:22,143
You're mad!

1421
02:11:25,811 --> 02:11:27,916
Goodbye, hairbrush!

1422
02:11:30,349 --> 02:11:31,350
Now, listen...

1423
02:11:32,618 --> 02:11:34,120
I have no real religion...

1424
02:11:34,353 --> 02:11:36,026
But I only believe in one religion.

1425
02:11:36,955 --> 02:11:38,093
R.D. Burman's music!

1426
02:11:39,491 --> 02:11:44,440
If we both look like Captain Picard anyway...
let the Starship Enterprise fly!

1427
02:11:45,297 --> 02:11:48,710
Were young, were free
and were ready

1428
02:11:48,934 --> 02:11:51,175
...to let the freak flag fly...

1429
02:11:51,236 --> 02:11:53,546
...with Jolly Good Bollywood!

1430
02:15:30,622 --> 02:15:33,000
Your tea, madam!

1431
02:15:34,126 --> 02:15:36,470
Careful, it's hot!

1432
02:15:41,666 --> 02:15:43,304
- Did it burn you?
- A little...

1433
02:15:51,109 --> 02:15:52,679
- Hi...
- Hi!

1434
02:16:14,332 --> 02:16:15,208
Ayan...

1435
02:16:17,302 --> 02:16:18,906
<i>Sorry</i>

1436
02:16:29,381 --> 02:16:32,055
Actually, sorry but I'm not sorry.

1437
02:16:34,186 --> 02:16:36,063
What do you Wm from me?

1438
02:16:37,556 --> 02:16:38,728
What do I do?

1439
02:16:39,958 --> 02:16:42,939
You think I'm dying
to sleep with you...

1440
02:16:46,498 --> 02:16:49,104
I'm dying for you to love me...

1441
02:16:50,402 --> 02:16:51,642
I've tried everything...

1442
02:16:51,736 --> 02:16:55,149
Staying away, staying close,
another relationship...

1443
02:16:55,240 --> 02:16:59,347
But I can't...
I can't get you out of my head!

1444
02:17:02,747 --> 02:17:05,455
What does DJ Ali have that I don't?

1445
02:17:06,952 --> 02:17:11,367
If I get some tattoos
and start spouting poetry...

1446
02:17:11,423 --> 02:17:13,232
Will you love me then?

1447
02:17:14,326 --> 02:17:18,468
Will I finally be worthy of your love?

1448
02:17:19,164 --> 02:17:20,700
Because I'll do it.

1449
02:17:21,266 --> 02:17:22,768
I can do it.

1450
02:17:29,107 --> 02:17:30,711
I'm talking to you.

1451
02:17:31,676 --> 02:17:33,383
Yeah, run away

1452
02:17:34,312 --> 02:17:36,223
Not like you have anything to say...

1453
02:17:36,715 --> 02:17:37,853
AhZeh

1454
02:17:42,654 --> 02:17:44,861
- I can break things, too!
- That's a pressure cooker!

1455
02:17:44,923 --> 02:17:46,869
Let M burst them

1456
02:17:48,393 --> 02:17:49,929
What do you want me to do?!

1457
02:17:50,128 --> 02:17:51,766
- Lie to you?
- Yes, lie to me!

1458
02:17:51,896 --> 02:17:54,342
- I can't lie!
- Why not?! You're dying, anyway!

1459
02:17:54,399 --> 02:17:57,005
Live or die, I will not lie to you!

1460
02:17:57,068 --> 02:18:00,880
This is the only honest thing
in my life, Ayan!

1461
02:18:01,039 --> 02:18:02,882
Can't you love me
instead of DJ Ali?

1462
02:18:04,476 --> 02:18:06,456
This IS love, Ayan...

1463
02:18:06,678 --> 02:18:11,024
- This isn't love.
- This IS love for me, Ayan!

1464
02:18:11,616 --> 02:18:17,862
Ayan, this is bigger than love...
This is the greatest love of my life.

1465
02:18:18,923 --> 02:18:20,596
I don't want this kind of love.

1466
02:18:21,559 --> 02:18:25,063
You're my friend...

1467
02:18:25,330 --> 02:18:27,241
My <i>famW</i>

1468
02:18:27,599 --> 02:18:29,101
My everything!

1469
02:18:29,367 --> 02:18:30,846
You're just not my lover.

1470
02:18:31,136 --> 02:18:34,345
Why not?
I can be your lover, too!

1471
02:18:34,406 --> 02:18:35,749
<i>Warm</i>

1472
02:18:36,441 --> 02:18:39,149
That kind of love has only destroyed me...
Do you want to be destroyed?!

1473
02:18:39,244 --> 02:18:43,420
Yes, I do.
I want to be destroyed.

1474
02:18:44,015 --> 02:18:47,155
This thing we have between us...
Our friendship...

1475
02:18:47,485 --> 02:18:49,761
n: my greatest strength

1476
02:18:50,322 --> 02:18:52,734
Love is my weakness...

1477
02:18:53,391 --> 02:18:55,496
Why don't you understand that?

1478
02:18:55,760 --> 02:19:00,402
Because a man and a woman
cannot be just friends!

1479
02:19:11,776 --> 02:19:13,756
Go...

1480
02:19:13,912 --> 02:19:15,550
Get out of here...

1481
02:19:16,247 --> 02:19:17,521
Go.

1482
02:19:17,682 --> 02:19:20,925
I can't explain this to you anymore...

1483
02:19:21,019 --> 02:19:24,432
If you can't understand, just leave...

1484
02:19:24,656 --> 02:19:27,899
Take your stuff and get out!

1485
02:19:29,561 --> 02:19:30,631
Get out!

1486
02:19:30,762 --> 02:19:32,435
Get out, Ayan!

1487
02:19:39,604 --> 02:19:40,708
Alizeh...

1488
02:19:42,707 --> 02:19:44,118
Alizeh, I'm sorry...

1489
02:19:55,387 --> 02:19:58,266
It's a strange story...
of Love and Friendship.

1490
02:19:58,757 --> 02:20:01,465
Love, the hero...
and Friendship, the heroine.

1491
02:20:01,926 --> 02:20:04,998
The awful thing is that
Love never understood Friendship.

1492
02:20:05,230 --> 02:20:09,576
'I do love you, Ayan...
Just not the way you want me to.'

1493
02:20:09,868 --> 02:20:11,677
- 'Love is passion...'

1494
02:20:12,504 --> 02:20:15,610
- '...but friendship is peace.'

1495
02:20:18,576 --> 02:20:23,150
One night, tired and weary,
Love threw a tantrum...

1496
02:20:23,982 --> 02:20:25,518
Like a spoilt child... Stupid!

1497
02:20:25,917 --> 02:20:27,760
And what did Friendship do?

1498
02:20:29,754 --> 02:20:30,698
Alizeh...

1499
02:20:31,089 --> 02:20:34,161
Friendship threw a tantrum, too,
and left in a huff.

1500
02:20:37,796 --> 02:20:39,935
And where else do heroines go?

1501
02:20:40,732 --> 02:20:41,642
The airport.

1502
02:20:42,133 --> 02:20:44,977
- 'Ayah... I'm going back home...'

1503
02:20:45,270 --> 02:20:47,341
And Love freaked out

1504
02:20:47,505 --> 02:20:51,146
- 'I hope one clay you'll
understand my love...'

1505
02:20:51,443 --> 02:20:55,152
When Love realised that Friendship
is leaving him forever... He ran.

1506
02:20:55,513 --> 02:20:58,323
And how he ram

1507
02:21:03,288 --> 02:21:04,164
H'! tam

1508
02:21:04,389 --> 02:21:05,459
Heathrow Airport!

1509
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:09,564
H'! trans

1510
02:21:13,765 --> 02:21:15,244
He ram

1511
02:21:17,936 --> 02:21:19,882
He didn't stop to breathe...

1512
02:21:21,172 --> 02:21:24,881
Because Love knew...
Friendship was about to breathe her last...

1513
02:21:25,877 --> 02:21:29,154
And he wanted to be with
her 'til her last moments.

1514
02:21:29,948 --> 02:21:31,291
That was Love's right.

1515
02:21:42,460 --> 02:21:44,804
I need to get to BA 109!

1516
02:21:46,531 --> 02:21:48,841
I'm sorry, the gate closed
20 minutes ago!

1517
02:21:48,933 --> 02:21:50,378
Has the flight taken off'?

1518
02:21:50,568 --> 02:21:51,911
It's about to go!

1519
02:21:58,877 --> 02:22:00,220
- Hello?
- Alizeh!

1520
02:22:00,411 --> 02:22:02,413
I'm at the airport!
I'm here!

1521
02:22:02,747 --> 02:22:04,556
Please don't go Alizeh, please stay!

1522
02:22:06,584 --> 02:22:09,121
Ayan, I'm talking off.

1523
02:22:50,028 --> 02:22:50,904
Hello?

1524
02:23:25,897 --> 02:23:26,875
Alizeh...

1525
02:23:28,066 --> 02:23:30,307
You can't die...

1526
02:23:35,440 --> 02:23:37,420
- Ma'am, keep that oxygen mask on.

1527
02:23:37,475 --> 02:23:40,581
Alizeh, listen to him...
Put it back.

1528
02:23:43,615 --> 02:23:44,992
Ayan...

1529
02:23:46,551 --> 02:23:49,157
I'm acting, I'm not really dying...

1530
02:23:49,587 --> 02:23:52,193
Don't react... We'll get caught.

1531
02:23:59,263 --> 02:24:02,142
How else do you runaway
from a runway?

1532
02:24:03,034 --> 02:24:05,844
Cancer's got to have some perks...

1533
02:24:11,609 --> 02:24:14,112
You came to the airport, Ayan...

1534
02:24:15,546 --> 02:24:18,220
You fulfilled my dream!

1535
02:24:19,951 --> 02:24:22,659
Alizeh, I'm sorry for last night...

1536
02:24:24,956 --> 02:24:29,098
Friendship doesn't know
sorry's and thank you's...

1537
02:24:33,398 --> 02:24:37,471
I swear I'll never trouble
you about this again...

1538
02:24:38,603 --> 02:24:40,344
Because, Ayan...

1539
02:24:41,172 --> 02:24:44,984
It's a lot like love!

1540
02:24:47,845 --> 02:24:49,688
I friend you.

1541
02:24:50,014 --> 02:24:52,585
I friend you, too.

1542
02:24:53,451 --> 02:24:55,021
I friend you for life...

1543
02:24:56,120 --> 02:24:58,999
I friend you, too,
for whatever life is left.

1544
02:25:09,067 --> 02:25:11,479
Come, now, sing something...

1545
02:25:11,969 --> 02:25:14,711
Anything you like... I'm sick!

1546
02:25:31,789 --> 02:25:32,927
Interview done?

1547
02:25:33,958 --> 02:25:35,062
<i>Away</i>

1548
02:25:35,893 --> 02:25:37,964
Hey... can I sing something?

1549
02:27:06,551 --> 02:27:07,552
Done
