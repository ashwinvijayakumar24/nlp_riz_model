1
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,082
You know.

2
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,999
Miles away from here.

3
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:02,082
Beyond good and evil.

4
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,707
There's a ground.

5
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,165
l will meet you there.

6
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,624
Often l've wondered

7
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:08,082
You, me, we are all mirrors

8
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,624
We catch our reflection in everyone

9
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,874
lt's not me, yet l am

10
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,624
Right...

11
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,165
Wrong...

12
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,040
l'm yours

13
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,999
To find me

14
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,999
ls to find yourself

15
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,332
All that l

16
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,707
Wish to say

17
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,999
ls ruined by

18
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:44,874
My words

19
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,165
Lovely.

20
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,790
Often l feel that

21
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,165
This whole world is magic

22
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,874
Which ls

23
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,957
And yet ls not

24
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,124
Seasons, clouds, wind, blossoms

25
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:48,999
They send signals to me

26
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:56,082
How do l narrate their tales

27
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,457
All that l

28
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,749
Wish to say

29
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,790
ls ruined by

30
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:13,749
My words

31
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,874
Oh yeah yeah

32
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,082
You want to be a Hero, huh?

33
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,665
This looks like a theater to you?

34
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,540
What's the matter, sir? Sir?
- Let go of it!

35
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,040
Be careful... the strings...

36
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,332
l told you to let go of it!

37
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,374
Take care of the strings.

38
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,457
Come... l'll make you
perform at the police station.

39
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,790
Sir... the strings...

40
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,957
Jim Morrison.

41
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,290
Who?

42
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,957
He was a great singer.

43
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,457
The chicks would tear their
clothes at the mere sight of him.

44
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,874
He stood before the crowd...

45
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,415
on the stage...

46
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,582
and raised his middle finger.

47
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,957
Just like this!

48
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,540
And the crowd went wild...

49
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,290
they cheered and whistled... as
if he had done something incredible.

50
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,874
While here l was,
respectfully singing...

51
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,165
so that the people waiting for
the bus would have a good time.

52
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,915
And these
no-good-cops began hitting me.

53
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,415
Very sad.

54
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,415
l mean, as if l were nothing.

55
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,040
Are you getting the samosas?

56
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,540
Right, continue to rip him off!

57
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,124
There are a thousand
criminals in Delhi...

58
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,415
the cops should go after them.

59
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,374
Exactly!

60
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,999
Why this poor guy?

61
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,124
Jim Morrison...

62
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,874
Janardan Jakhar.

63
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,624
JM...

64
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,082
JJ.

65
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,124
Guys, he's a dead item!

66
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,165
And is this the
latest low class fashion?

67
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,415
To Be With You...

68
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,040
lead break.

69
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,999
Keep some style, dude!

70
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,790
Man, you're on stage!

71
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,957
You should have some
stage presence, right?

72
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,749
Attitude!

73
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,749
Like this...

74
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,374
like this!

75
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,832
As if you are going
to blow everyone away!

76
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,749
What happened?

77
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,665
JJ?

78
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,040
My days aren't going well...

79
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,124
Right now it's just
a few bad days, son.

80
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,165
lf you don't stop your
strumming and singing...

81
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,832
then just see how your
whole life goes bad.

82
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,457
This guy is very negative!

83
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,874
You loser!

84
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,124
As if he will strike it rich
with his father's business.

85
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,332
l will never join
the transport business.

86
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,874
Well then, get your degree and..

87
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,540
..become an advocate
at the district court.

88
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,332
Trust me, that's the best you can do.

89
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,374
So he shouldn't even try?

90
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,999
That rules out any
chance he might have.

91
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,165
He doesn't stand a chance anyway.

92
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:17,082
You don't become big, just by
striking a pose with a guitar.

93
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,499
But he has been playing
the guitar since he was a kid!

94
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,999
Then why hasn't he
tasted success yet?

95
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,540
Tell me.

96
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,374
You mean...
- Because he doesn't have it in him.

97
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,540
He doesn't have that quality.

98
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,124
And what kind of friends are you?

99
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,165
Just to eat the samosas he pays for?

100
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,040
Hey!
- Why don't you explain it to him?

101
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,874
The sooner he understands,
the better it is.

102
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,457
All that l

103
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,540
Wish to say

104
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,624
ls ruined by

105
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:46,999
Take down my number...

106
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,874
call me if l am selected.
- Number?

107
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:49,999
Take it down...

108
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,082
l have your visiting card...

109
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,915
Hindu College canteen...
l'll call you.

110
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,624
What if l work really hard?

111
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,582
Even a donkey works hard.

112
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,624
Well then...

113
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,665
what do l lack? Tell me!

114
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:02,999
See...

115
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,040
an artiste has a
particular type of heart...

116
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,582
a particular personality.

117
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,332
And l don't?

118
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,665
You can't have it.

119
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,332
Your life hasn't been like that.

120
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,665
lt's a different type of life...

121
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,124
that makes a person an artiste.

122
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:21,999
What type?

123
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,749
Take a look at anyone's life.

124
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,915
All these musicians, singers...

125
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,374
artists, painters, writers.

126
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,832
Take a look.

127
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,040
They all have one thing in common.

128
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:35,915
What?

129
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,499
Which they all definitely
have in some form or the other.

130
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,082
What is it, Khatana bhai?

131
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,707
Pain.

132
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,415
What?

133
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,624
Pain.

134
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,165
Sorrow, misery, tears...

135
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,874
Oh... is that right?

136
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,957
Until a person doesn't suffer...

137
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,457
he can never make it big.

138
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,040
And change your friend circle!

139
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,415
Pain.

140
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,165
lf you hang around with these losers,
you're going nowhere.

141
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,999
They've all gone
through a lot of pain, Bittu.

142
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,540
They got hurt...

143
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,999
suffered, winced in pain.

144
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,290
Problems...

145
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,374
tragedies...

146
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,374
and me?

147
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,457
l haven't gone through anything.

148
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,165
l don't have even a single problem.

149
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,332
Never starved for food...

150
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,540
never struggled for anything...

151
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,165
even my parents are still alive.

152
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,624
Wasn't beaten as a child...

153
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,540
nor molested.

154
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,624
l'm not even adopted, l'm my
parent's biological child.

155
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,290
Never met with any big accident...

156
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,499
nor had a life-threatening disease.

157
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:13,999
Oh no!

158
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,457
Music can only come
from a broken heart.

159
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,124
When you're heart's broken...

160
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,290
shattered into tiny pieces...

161
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,665
that's when the music flows.

162
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,832
What have you ever been through?

163
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,790
Has your heart ever been broken?

164
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,665
Have you even been in love?

165
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,374
lf you have to think about it,
then obviously not, you idiot!

166
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,124
True love.

167
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,040
Passion.

168
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,040
So then?

169
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,124
Where will the music come from?

170
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,874
You tell me.

171
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,124
Where will it come from?

172
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,999
Hey JJ!

173
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,999
You could've come along with us.

174
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,457
l'm heading to the Law FAC.

175
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,332
l can't sit through
a dance performance.

176
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,707
Who's going for the dance?

177
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,124
We're going there for the girl!

178
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,707
Go ahead,
- Come on!

179
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:50,999
What's to see?

180
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,540
As long as she is in Stephen's,
she will always be number one.

181
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,707
Come on!
- Let's sit right in the front!

182
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,415
Sit here.
- Sit!

183
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,999
Ladies and Gentlemen.

184
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,624
Welcome to 'Shut Up and Dance'.

185
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,957
Presenting the first
performance led by..

186
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,624
Heer Kaul.

187
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,332
lt's true, what they
say about Kashmir.

188
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,499
Heer from Kashmir?

189
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,040
lf there's any heaven on earth...

190
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,749
it is right here...

191
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,790
within her clothes!

192
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,790
Over there, look!

193
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,082
How?

194
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,999
l mean... what material
did God use to make that.

195
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,165
Dude, the material is the same...

196
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,874
but the engineering is mind blowing!

197
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,832
The car or the girl?

198
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,582
Both!

199
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,749
Watch carefully...

200
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,999
it's her last performance.

201
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,665
Why is she in such
a hurry to get married?

202
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,415
You have a problem?

203
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:36,999
Take it easy, buddy.

204
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,540
That's Heer.

205
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,582
Watch her from a distance
and be satisfied.

206
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:53,749
No way...

207
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,540
l should try my luck.

208
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,999
A lot of guys have tried...

209
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,790
and every one of them has failed.

210
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,290
She is a heart-breaker.

211
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,457
ls it?

212
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,790
Yes.

213
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,332
Wow!

214
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,415
Okay JJ...

215
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,957
Jai Bajrang Bali!

216
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,082
Heer...

217
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:06,832
Hi.

218
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,874
Janardan...

219
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,540
JJ for short.

220
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,374
We need to talk.

221
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,332
About what?

222
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,790
Actually... you...

223
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,415
l think you are pretty cool.

224
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,165
l had to tell you this.

225
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,374
And you are quite hot too.

226
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,874
Amazing combination, isn't it?
Hot and cool at the same time.

227
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,915
Anything else?

228
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:30,999
Yes...

229
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:32,999
l love you.

230
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,082
Be my girlfriend.

231
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,624
Can you see everyone
is laughing at you?

232
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,582
All l can see is you.

233
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,790
You can see me, right?

234
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,040
Then listen
carefully to what l'm saying.

235
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,832
Bugger off!

236
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,832
You and l will rock it,
l'm telling you.

237
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:52,999
Think about it.

238
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,374
Hey... are you stupid?

239
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,582
No, only crazy for you baby.

240
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:57,957
Okay, enough.

241
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,457
Just get lost now!

242
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,040
Sure?

243
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,415
Am l sure?

244
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,540
One second, let me think...

245
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,499
Yes, l'm sure, you idiot!

246
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,040
Get lost!

247
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,874
You are breaking my heart, Heer.

248
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,999
Listen...
- JJ...

249
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,999
l don't want to see your
face again, do you hear me?

250
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,540
Are you sure?

251
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,415
Bugger off!
- Okay.

252
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,374
Okay.

253
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,374
What's he on, man?
- Who is he?

254
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,165
ls he from Hindu?

255
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,707
Do you want me to eat two
samosas in this much chutney?

256
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,582
Get me more.

257
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,457
You think this is a joke?

258
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,165
Khatana bhai...

259
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,415
l love her really.

260
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,624
You can't imagine how
it felt when she said...

261
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,082
'Burger off!'

262
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,040
l don't even know what that means.

263
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,999
You are such a shallow person.

264
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,082
Sheesh!

265
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,707
lf your heart were really broken
you wouldn't be gorging on samosas!

266
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,374
or fighting for chutney!

267
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,082
You can't eat a
morsel for weeks on end.

268
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,874
There should be intensity in love...

269
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,082
There should be pain...

270
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:12,290
This isn't love, or heart break...

271
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,165
This is a cheap act, drama.

272
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,999
What should l do then?

273
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,665
What's the trick?

274
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,415
How do l...

275
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,999
Couldn't you wait at the station?

276
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,915
There was a lot to do?

277
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,999
He probably forgot...

278
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,624
Really? l don't forget anything.

279
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:35,415
Where are you lost?

280
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,165
Look at him...

281
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,582
he doesn't give a damn
about what you're saying!

282
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,582
l have a lot of stress, okay?

283
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:43,999
Don't scold me now.

284
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,415
So tell me when!

285
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:46,999
Give me an appointment.

286
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,290
Tuesday at eleven?

287
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:50,707
Or Wednesday at half past six?

288
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,165
Let me know when l can scold you,
l'll adjust my life accordingly.

289
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:55,290
Odysseus'...
- Yes?

290
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,374
Heer.

291
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,749
lf it's not critically important,
l suggest you wait till after the...

292
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,624
l want to propose to Heer.

293
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,374
Critically important.

294
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,832
Okay, l think you should leave.

295
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,165
This is true love, Madam.

296
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:11,999
She has no right to dump me
and marry some other guy...

297
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:13,332
just because he is rich!

298
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:14,915
What the hell?

299
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,165
What's your bloody problem?

300
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,582
Give me one chance, Heer.

301
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,082
l'll work really hard and...

302
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:20,624
l'll also become rich one day.

303
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:21,874
Listen, you jerk...

304
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,499
if l ever see you again...

305
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,082
you just see what l'll do to you.

306
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,374
What... what will you do?

307
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,165
l'll get your legs broken.

308
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,165
l'll have you banned
from entering campus...

309
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,874
l'll ruin you!

310
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:34,624
ls her anger for real?

311
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,415
l don't think you've
ever been in love.

312
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:46,790
lt's different.

313
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,582
Driver, throw him out!
- Yes, madam.

314
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,499
But you will realise
it sooner or later...

315
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,624
l know.
- Throw him out!

316
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,749
We just need to spend
some quality time together.

317
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:58,540
Enough! Now see how l set you right.

318
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,874
You can take any action.

319
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:02,707
File a police compliant.

320
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:03,999
He's after her.

321
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,540
You know true love...

322
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,707
the intense kind...

323
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,749
...it doesn't fear the world.

324
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,665
Not even the police!

325
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:16,999
The poet Ghalib has
explained it very well.

326
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,915
Now l don't remember it,
but l will ask and tell you.

327
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,999
How will you ever know,
if you don't give me a chance?

328
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:31,540
Talking is important,
try to understand.

329
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:34,624
Okay, let's talk right now. Come on.

330
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:38,957
Yes... tell me.

331
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:40,999
What happened?

332
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,082
You wanted to talk, right?
l'm listening.

333
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:44,499
Go on.

334
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:46,457
Well... l...

335
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:47,915
What?

336
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,457
We should give it a chance...

337
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:51,082
Okay, let's give it a chance.

338
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:53,332
Come on...
give it a chance, come on!

339
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:55,665
What are you thinking?
Give it a chance.

340
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,832
What happened?

341
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:58,832
The thing is...
- Yes, what is the thing?

342
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,999
Tell me... l really want
to know what is the thing.

343
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,040
You see...

344
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,165
Yes?

345
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,665
l...
- You...

346
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,624
come on!
- Sorry...

347
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,332
Sorry.

348
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,290

349
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:14,665
l didn't think...

350
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,707
l'm sorry.

351
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,624
He'll get hurt.

352
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:35,374
Hi.

353
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,999
What happened?

354
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,999
l'll be right back.
- What's wrong?

355
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:00,999
Yes, old man...

356
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:04,165
what can l do for you?

357
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:09,040
l'll join you.

358
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:11,999
Excuse me?

359
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:15,165
Hi.

360
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,082
Can l talk to you for a minute?

361
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,915
l'll be back...

362
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,499
okay?

363
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,290
Come here.

364
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:51,040
You don't have to be so nervous,
every time you see me.

365
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:53,290
Okay? lt's fine.

366
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,915
l'm not angry with you anymore.

367
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,415
So relax.

368
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:59,290
Thanks a lot.

369
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:00,915
Thank you very much.

370
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,665
And l'm really sorry.
- Okay, bye.

371
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:05,957
And l don't love you or anything...

372
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,332
not even a little.

373
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:09,582
Okay.
- Everyone on campus says that...

374
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:11,624
Heer is gorgeous, she is hot.

375
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:13,290
Even my friends say that but...

376
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,915
personally l don't
think you are all that hot.

377
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:17,332
Or even cool.

378
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:18,999
Like l said?

379
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,124
l mean...

380
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:26,457
l don't mean you're ugly or anything.

381
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:28,707
You are beautiful...

382
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:30,124
it's not that...

383
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:32,540
but l... l am...

384
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:34,415
Then why were you chasing me?

385
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,790
Well... l...

386
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,165
l can't tell you, it's really crazy.

387
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:44,082
Well, everybody does crazy things.

388
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:47,040
For you, bunking
classes might be crazy...

389
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,832
or having pani puri.

390
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:50,415
l guess you do that and think...

391
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,540
'Oh my God, today was one crazy day!'

392
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,999
lt's a little different for me.

393
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,957
So...

394
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:03,499
Okay, bye!

395
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:06,040
Hey!

396
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:08,374
What do you think l am?

397
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:12,124
Oh no, l didn't mean
it in any wrong way.

398
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:13,874
Then what did you mean?

399
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,790
l mean you are...

400
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:19,165
l mean...
- What?!

401
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:21,874
You are...
- What?!

402
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:23,999
Neat and clean!

403
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:25,749
Totally!

404
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:27,540
Nice.

405
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:29,999
Sophisticated...
from an elegant family.

406
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,499
Neat and clean?

407
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:32,915
And Hi-Fi!

408
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:34,332
Hi-Fi!

409
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,749
There's this cinema theatre...

410
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:42,915
Amar Talkies in Old Delhi.

411
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:45,457
There's a film playing there...

412
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:47,540
Junglee Jawani [Wild Youth]

413
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:49,624
l'm going to see it.

414
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:51,957
What?!

415
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,999
Yeah.

416
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,790
Do you even know what
kind of a film it is?

417
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:59,749
l've seen the posters.

418
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,374
You still want to watch it?

419
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,374
l've figured out the way...

420
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:07,374
l've also made the excuses.

421
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,999
You can't go there, by the way.

422
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,540
Of course, l am.

423
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,790
With whom?
- On my own!

424
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:20,332
You are wicked!

425
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,374
By God!

426
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:25,999
Junglee Jawani [Wild Youth]

427
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:48,999
Sir, this CD has it all,
take it sir.

428
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:06,540
Hey Brother, come on!

429
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:37,999
Run run run...

430
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,165
Happy?

431
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:45,374
We should've stayed longer.

432
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:47,790
You would've been raped
if the lights had come on.

433
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,874
Wild Youth, Part Two.

434
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,790
Let's do another thing today.

435
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:56,999
By God, l'm scared to hear it.

436
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:59,707
Where can we get some cheap liquor?

437
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,915
You're Heer, right?

438
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:05,165
Let me look at you. - l want
to drink, where can we get it?

439
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:07,665
Are you the Heer Kaul
from Stephen's college?

440
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,040
That's enough! l want to drink!

441
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:11,332
Cheers!

442
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:16,582
ls it good?
- lt's very bad!

443
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:22,332
Why aren't you drinking?

444
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:23,582
l am.

445
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:25,082
Let me see... drink!

446
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:30,665
Yuck!

447
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:32,457
lt's so bitter!

448
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:34,332
How do people drink it?

449
00:31:34,916 --> 00:31:36,165
Don't you drink?

450
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:39,457
l sprinkle some on my face and...

451
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:40,957
a little around my collar.

452
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,332
l throw the rest away
and act as if l'm sloshed.

453
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:48,040
You're the first one
who has caught me.

454
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:51,290
Then you can't pretend with me.

455
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:53,290
With me, you have to drink.

456
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:54,582
Go for it, cheers!

457
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,165
One more...
- You are so...

458
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:00,999
Cheers!
- Jai Bajrang Bali!

459
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:12,290
l'm getting married.

460
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:14,499
The entire University knows.

461
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:16,540
Really?

462
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:18,624
You are drunk!

463
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:20,999
Just two months to go.

464
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,749
l've heard you've hit it big!

465
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:26,832
Paris?

466
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:27,999
Prague.

467
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,957
And once l'm married...

468
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:31,999
no 'Wild Youth' and...

469
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:33,999
no cheap liquor.

470
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:36,165
Then, l'll be a lady.

471
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:39,999
Lady... neat and clean.

472
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:42,832
Oh...

473
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:46,790
so that's why you want to do all
these cheap things before marriage.

474
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:50,082
You are not as stupid as you look!

475
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:52,957
Even you don't look
as wicked as you are.

476
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,332
You want to go back home or
get some more cheap thrills?

477
00:32:57,791 --> 00:32:58,999
Lots!

478
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:01,124
l want to do a lot of cheap things.

479
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:03,624
l have to perform huge feats!

480
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:06,540
but where's the time, my friend?

481
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:07,999
Where is the time?

482
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:09,874
So what if we don't have time today...

483
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,499
we have time tomorrow!

484
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:13,499
You are a genius!

485
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:15,290
How did you fail in B.A. pass?

486
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:16,915
And day after!

487
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,457
And the day after that...

488
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,957
And time demands that...

489
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,707
You make your list!

490
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:27,957
Make a list of all the
little worms inside you...

491
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:32,665
l swear, before you get married,
we'll kill each one of them.

492
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,374
Promise?
- l swear!

493
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:38,915
Anyway, my image is
ruined before you.

494
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:40,999
Right, you're completely
exposed now!

495
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:42,749
ln that case l'll get
the list ready.

496
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:45,999
You better!
- Okay.

497
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:51,540
Hello Sir...

498
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:52,749
Everything okay?

499
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:54,290
How are you?

500
00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:06,874
See you.

501
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:10,499
l spin a yarn

502
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:13,374
Of you, l spin a yarn

503
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:16,999
Of you

504
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:21,540
All night l spin a yarn

505
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,832
Spin a yarn

506
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:26,790
All night l spin a yarn

507
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:29,582
Spin a yarn

508
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:32,165
All night l spin a yarn

509
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:35,082
All day l pass in thinking

510
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:37,874
lt's for you that l live and die

511
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:40,582
Ting ling ling ling

512
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:02,415
This friend of yours is
quite unique.

513
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,165
At least you shouldn't complain.

514
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:08,124
Should l change it?

515
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:08,999
Switch it on.

516
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:09,999
Two minutes!

517
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,999
l'll go on my bike
and get the Disprin.

518
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:13,290
Poor guy!

519
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:16,582
Why 'poor guy'? He enjoys it too!

520
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:18,665
Why are you cheating?

521
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:20,415
Why are you using the shortcuts?

522
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,707
Now you're dead, Mandy!

523
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:24,332
No way! lt's you who will die!

524
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,707
You should invite him
for the wedding.

525
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,707
He comes shopping for the wedding...

526
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:30,332
of course he'll come
for the wedding.

527
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:34,540
Hey!

528
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:38,999
Wear this for your husband.

529
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,040
His tongue will touch the floor!

530
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:48,540
Let me see...

531
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:49,999
move your hand.

532
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:52,499
Nice.

533
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:53,999
A little lower, show a little more.

534
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:57,582
Lower it some more,
what's the matter?

535
00:35:59,916 --> 00:36:01,999
Fine?
- Firecracker!

536
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:04,624
His body will catch fire.

537
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:07,790
His 'Wild Youth' will arise.

538
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,665
Listen... l can't make it right now.

539
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,999
But Khatana bhai has kept the
Platinum Music guys waiting...

540
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,665
in his canteen.

541
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:20,540
Tell Khatana bhai that
you couldn't find me.

542
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:21,874
What?
- And listen...

543
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:23,624
don't come looking for
me for the next few days.

544
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:25,540
l'm going away for a while
and l've made excuses at home.

545
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:26,957
Where are you going?

546
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,374
Kashmir.
- Kashmir?

547
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:36,165
Thank God!

548
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:38,290
l was getting so bored here.

549
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:40,915
There's nothing to do
at your own wedding.

550
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,040
Come on.

551
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:43,832
Let it be, he'll take it.

552
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:44,999
Come...

553
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,624
Everything is set.

554
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:53,707
Come on.

555
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,165
Not right now, l'm the bride!

556
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,415
Sunrise?

557
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:00,874
Done!

558
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:02,082
Think you can make it?

559
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:05,374
Who has the guts to dare stop me?

560
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:08,749
Nobody here knows the real you.

561
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,374
Only you know it!

562
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:12,915
Don't tell anyone.

563
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,165
Okay!
- Okay.

564
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:44,999
Keep dancing around,
keep skipping around

565
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:47,290
l keep roaming around

566
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,999
l cross limits

567
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:55,582
gust of breeze, l plunder myself

568
00:37:55,666 --> 00:37:58,457
l plunder myself

569
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:01,165
gust of breeze, l plunder myself

570
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:02,790
Hold this.

571
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,665
Come on JJ.

572
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,582
Hi.
- Hi.

573
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,665
Welcome...

574
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,999
Hi.
- Hi.

575
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,582
Guys, remember him?

576
00:38:14,666 --> 00:38:15,915
He's also here?

577
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,915
He's Jordan.
- Jordan?

578
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,999
Great combination, isn't it?
Short and cool at the same time?

579
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,624
Hi Jordan...

580
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:25,124
Aman.

581
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:26,665
Jordan.

582
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,165
Hi, l'm Mahi.

583
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:30,999
Jordan.

584
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,707
This face like the bright moon

585
00:38:41,791 --> 00:38:43,749
This golden hew of hair

586
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:45,999
These eyes like the blue lake

587
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:47,832
There is a deep mystery in them

588
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:51,957
What praise should l give to

589
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,832
He who has created you?

590
00:38:56,375 --> 00:39:00,415
What praise should l give to

591
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,999
He who has created you?

592
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:05,957
Hi.

593
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,832
Put this up.

594
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:22,499
That side too.

595
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:23,957
Okay.

596
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:41,624
Jordan...

597
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:42,999
can you hug me?

598
00:40:43,416 --> 00:40:44,832
Now?

599
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:51,582
Are you in a hurry?

600
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:52,874
No.

601
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:57,499
Give me a proper hug...

602
00:40:57,583 --> 00:40:58,749
tightly.

603
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:10,374
ls this okay?

604
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:22,707
Okay.

605
00:41:22,791 --> 00:41:24,332
l should leave.

606
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,415
They're probably looking for me.

607
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:41,957
Very nice.

608
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:10,457
What?

609
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:14,124
Why are you getting so sentimental?

610
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:15,999
l'm getting married.

611
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:17,874
lf it's bothering you so much,
don't get married.

612
00:42:17,958 --> 00:42:19,124
And then?

613
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:20,999
The back door is open...

614
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:22,749
run away.

615
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,082
Come.

616
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,499
Tell me something...
- Don't ask me anything...

617
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,624
or else l'll tell the truth.

618
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:33,957
So say it, what's stopping you?

619
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:37,040
Yes.

620
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:38,790
Yes, what?

621
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:43,415
How do l look?

622
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:46,290
The college guys were right.

623
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:48,499
You look hot.

624
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:50,957
The bride matches the
standard of the wedding, right?

625
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:53,582
Do you know...

626
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:55,790
the guests at the wedding...

627
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,874
fantasize about the bride at night.

628
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:02,082
Will you also fantasize about me?

629
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,540
Listen...

630
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,165
you haven't fallen in love
with me or anything, right?

631
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:16,165
When are you coming to visit me?

632
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:17,707
Prague?

633
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:20,749
l've never even been to Nepal.

634
00:43:20,916 --> 00:43:22,582
But you'll have to come to Prague.

635
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:24,999
Okay, done.

636
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:26,957
So...

637
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,999
l'll go first. Then, you come later.

638
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:33,665
Together we'll do a lot of
cheap things in Prague, okay?

639
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,749
ls this plan okay?

640
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:38,665
Or should we run away now?

641
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:03,415
l've taken flight again

642
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,540
l've let go of the world below

643
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:13,124
And l submit myself to you, O wind

644
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:16,499
Now people are far away

645
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:18,999
Miles away are these valleys

646
00:44:21,666 --> 00:44:23,624
Slowly each cloud
comes to touch my body

647
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:27,165
But no cloud is able to drench me

648
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,582
Never stopped at any place

649
00:44:31,666 --> 00:44:33,582
Never even met myself

650
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:35,832
l may complain but upset l'm not

651
00:44:35,916 --> 00:44:37,957
Cities and villages appear the same

652
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,415
People and their
names all seem the same

653
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:53,332
l've taken flight again

654
00:44:55,708 --> 00:44:59,665
Dreams, like dust,
reappear in my eyes

655
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:03,082
No matter how much
l brush them away

656
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,082
So many dreams

657
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:13,082
l have broken and left behind

658
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:20,040
Yet why do they return and
take me away on their wings

659
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:31,707
Over branches and leaves

660
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:33,665
By my side they travel door to door

661
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,582
Sometimes desert, sometimes rain

662
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,582
Like a demon,
l die a thousand times

663
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:39,624
Over branches and leaves

664
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:41,582
Sometimes day is night,
sometimes day is day

665
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:43,915
What is real, what is illusion

666
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:51,582
Almighty
- Almighty

667
00:45:55,916 --> 00:45:58,374
Here and there and scattered,
who knows

668
00:45:58,458 --> 00:46:01,290
Maybe the breeze will
take me in your direction

669
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:05,582
Your thoughts pull me

670
00:46:05,666 --> 00:46:07,999
Towards you

671
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:35,707
l keep flying about in
these colourful illusions

672
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:39,624
Keep flying...

673
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:43,749
l keep flying about in
these colourful illusions

674
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:46,665
Keep flying...

675
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:18,999
Tell me...

676
00:47:19,041 --> 00:47:22,165
has the media stooped so low that
just about anything makes the news?

677
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:25,999
You pick any loser
and make him a star?

678
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,832
Who is this Jordan?

679
00:47:27,916 --> 00:47:29,624
What's his claim to fame?

680
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:31,540
Sir, he is an artiste
with your Platinum Music.

681
00:47:31,625 --> 00:47:33,374
He is not an artiste
of Platinum Music.

682
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:36,707
He sang some songs
in the 'Sheher' album.

683
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:37,999
And you guys are
trying to make him a star.

684
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:39,540
Trust me...

685
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:40,999
l'm not his fan.

686
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:42,415
lt's just my job...

687
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,999
But it's not my job to
sing his false praises.

688
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:46,332
Take it off!

689
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:50,040
The packaging for
the episode is ready.

690
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:54,040
So get your hands on anything you
can about him and put it together.

691
00:47:55,458 --> 00:47:57,124
He doesn't live here anymore.

692
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,332
lt's been two years...

693
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:01,624
But can l at least
talk to his family?

694
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:03,290
He has no family here.

695
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:05,457
Please don't call again.

696
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,332
l can't do it, Mohit.

697
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:08,832
Sheena get real.

698
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,124
We need four such interviews
every month for the Rising Star.

699
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:13,832
Let go of your ego.

700
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:16,540
Be shameless and get
the material ready.

701
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,790
No, actually he is not
in touch with any of us.

702
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:23,457
After college what happened
to him... no one really knows.

703
00:48:23,541 --> 00:48:25,874
Any other lead? Any one
special from those days?

704
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:28,040
Please think...

705
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:33,832
Jordan always had a
keen interest in music.

706
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,082
And l often tried to
encourage the musician in him.

707
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,749
He was a fountain of talent.

708
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:47,082
Apart from being very talented,
he was also a good human being.

709
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:52,457
The kids want to know when
this interview will go on air.

710
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:54,124
lt won't come on TV.

711
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,082
Why not?

712
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:59,040
Because l don't have any
material on this Jordan.

713
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:01,624
But l just said so much.

714
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:03,040
But all lies?

715
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:04,374
Correct?

716
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:05,749
Why?

717
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:07,582
My questions are simple.

718
00:49:07,666 --> 00:49:09,665
You knew Jordan well, right?

719
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,874
So, why don't you
just tell me the truth?

720
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:13,165
You are getting very angry.

721
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:14,624
No, l really want to know.

722
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:16,749
Now the camera isn't rolling,
so tell me.

723
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:18,790
Who is this Jordan, after all?

724
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:21,499
You know...

725
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:23,957
there are these people...

726
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:26,290
who are always lost.

727
00:49:26,916 --> 00:49:27,957
You understand, right?

728
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,790
l don't understand at all.

729
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:33,707
For example, Platinum Music, okay?

730
00:49:34,291 --> 00:49:36,332
There was a time when
he would've given his life..

731
00:49:36,416 --> 00:49:37,749
..even to talk to the clerks there.

732
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,707
That was his craze.

733
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:41,582
Then one day l told him...

734
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,415
Hey...

735
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:45,499
Prince of music!

736
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:46,874
Where have you been?

737
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:47,957
l was...

738
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,040
The Platinum Music
guys were looking for you.

739
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:51,915
Dilip Menon, remember him?

740
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,499
l'll call you, Khatana bhai.

741
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:55,332
l'll see you tomorrow.

742
00:49:55,416 --> 00:49:56,999
What's got into you?

743
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:59,124
Don't you want to be Jim Morrison?

744
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:00,415
l'll be him, Khatana bhai.

745
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,165
l'll be him tomorrow.

746
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,457
Two weeks later the Platinum Music
agents came here looking for him.

747
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:11,040
l offered them four
samosas and made them wait.

748
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:13,915
l even sent someone to his place...

749
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:17,374
Tell Khatana bhai that you couldn't
find me. - What? - And listen...

750
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:19,457
don't come here looking for me.

751
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:20,999
l'm going away for a while
and l've made excuses at home.

752
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:22,707
Where are you going?

753
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:25,832
Kashmir.

754
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:26,999
Why Kashmir?

755
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:28,332
l don't know.

756
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:29,957
But when he returned he was caught.

757
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:31,582
His brothers yelled at him...

758
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:33,874
mother cried her eyes out,
you know, full social drama.

759
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:35,374
l told you a million times...

760
00:50:35,458 --> 00:50:36,540
We sweat it out like dogs...

761
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:38,040
while he plays the guitar!

762
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,165
Just a minute... Gurmeet!

763
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:40,457
Who is Heer?

764
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:42,457
What's your scene with her?
- Nothing.

765
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:44,082
You're lying. Another lie.

766
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:47,499
Get his guitar...
where's the bloody guitar?

767
00:50:47,583 --> 00:50:49,915
lf there's nothing, why
did you attend her wedding?

768
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,999
Get his guitar...

769
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:53,582
Why did you go there?
- Where's the guitar?

770
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,332
What's up, Khatana bhai?

771
00:50:58,833 --> 00:50:59,915
How are things?

772
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,290
Where the hell have you been?

773
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:02,874
You've stopped coming to college.

774
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:04,874
You know, it's not
that bad after all.

775
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:07,540
There's an AC and
l don't have a lot of work.

776
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:09,415
l have installed
video games on the TV.

777
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:10,915
Khatana bhai ...

778
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,582
there's a whole world
inside these video games.

779
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,082
Didn't he say he would never
get into the family business?

780
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:20,999
What about music?

781
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:22,499
He gave it up.

782
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:23,915
And then?

783
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,749
And one day it was the
same thing all over again.

784
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:28,290
Same brothers, same mother...

785
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:29,915
the same social drama.

786
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,707
Tell me... now!
- Let go of my collar!

787
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:33,957
Confess you stole the
money and l'll let go.

788
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,999
Five hundred thousand rupees?
Just vanished into thin air?

789
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:38,499
Why would he steal his own money?

790
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:40,707
You won't confess?

791
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:43,499
l've been telling
you l didn't steal it!

792
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,374
All you want to do is beat me up!

793
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:46,582
Probably someone else stole it.

794
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:48,332
Shut up! But he is in
charge of that place.

795
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:49,915
The key is always in the drawer.

796
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,040
Everybody knows that...

797
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:51,999
ask your staff.

798
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:54,874
And Bhabhi, you don't have
to touch me to console me.

799
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,290
l've told you a thousand times that
l can hear you even from a distance.

800
00:51:57,375 --> 00:51:59,874
There's no need to stick
like chewing-gum all the time.

801
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:08,582
This has happened even before me.

802
00:52:09,041 --> 00:52:10,624
l've always heard that
the warehouse was...

803
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:19,957
Can l stay here for a few days?

804
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,790
So he stayed at your place?

805
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,749
He still lives at my place.

806
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,957
Relax... have some tea-coffee...

807
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:39,957
So the night he was thrown out,
he came to your house?

808
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:42,332
Not that night... two months later.

809
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:43,999
Two months later?

810
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:45,582
More or less.

811
00:52:46,541 --> 00:52:47,999
So then where were
you for two months?

812
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:52,790
Bloody idiot, where were you?

813
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:54,457
At a shrine...

814
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:56,499
The shrine of Hazrat Nizamuddin.

815
00:52:56,583 --> 00:52:57,749
Two months?

816
00:52:57,833 --> 00:52:59,457
l tried to go home...

817
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:01,124
three times.

818
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:04,124
But they refused to take me back.

819
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:05,999
So what did you do at the shrine?

820
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:07,165
Nothing...

821
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:08,832
What do you mean 'nothing'?

822
00:53:09,416 --> 00:53:10,999
You must've done
something for two months!

823
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:25,957
Nizamuddin Aulia -Nizamuddin Master

824
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:35,582
Lift your foot

825
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:40,665
Cross over

826
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:45,707
Move into emptiness

827
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:48,874
Your beloved's home

828
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,832

829
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:56,082
Move into emptiness

830
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,915
ls empty without you

831
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,665
Move into emptiness

832
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:33,624

00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:55,749
"Be" And There Was

834
00:55:01,291 --> 00:55:06,290
When even nothingness was not

835
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:11,874
He alone existed

836
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:17,374
When even nothingness was not

837
00:55:17,458 --> 00:55:22,707
He alone existed

838
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:28,415
Who dwells in me, who dwells in you

839
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,582
He is the Lord, He is the illusion

840
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:39,082
Who dwells in me, who dwells in you

841
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:43,540
He is the Lord, He is the illusion

842
00:55:44,916 --> 00:55:54,124
"Be" And There Was

843
00:56:12,666 --> 00:56:17,999

848
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:48,040

ln the dark night Your lamp burns

850
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:58,082
The drop that l got from
your doorstep, O Lord Lord

851
00:57:01,916 --> 00:57:06,915
"Be" And There Was

852
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,540
When even nothingness was not

853
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:31,540

855
00:58:00,875 --> 00:58:06,290
Do this favour to me, O Lord

856
00:58:06,375 --> 00:58:12,374
l request you, set me

857
00:58:13,625 --> 00:58:18,457
Free from myself

858
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,665
Let me see myself

859
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:28,582
Set me

860
00:58:28,958 --> 00:58:37,457
Free from myself

861
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:47,332
These doubts of my mind

862
00:58:47,541 --> 00:58:49,957
These weak actions of mine

863
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:52,790
Are taking me where

864
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,499

865
00:58:55,791 --> 00:58:58,374

l'm just your shadow

870

You created me

871
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,874
The world pushed me away

872
00:59:14,958 --> 00:59:17,582
You embraced me

873
00:59:17,666 --> 00:59:20,165
You are the truth, O Lord

874
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:23,415
You are the truth

875
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:31,165

878
00:59:53,041 --> 00:59:54,374

879
01:00:03,916 --> 01:00:06,832
"Glory to Mother Goddess."

880
01:00:06,916 --> 01:00:09,457
"Glory to thee."

881
01:00:09,541 --> 01:00:12,165
"Glory to Mother Goddess."

882
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:14,582
"Glory to thee."

883
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:17,415
"l come seeking refuge."

884
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,999
"l don't know what to ask for."

885
01:00:20,291 --> 01:00:22,707
"You get rid of everyone's sorrows."

886
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:24,790
"So l know."

887
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:28,290
"Everyone say."

888
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,290
"Glory to Mother Goddess."

"Glory to Mother Goddess."

891
01:00:39,625 --> 01:00:42,457
"Glory to thee."

892
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:01,999
Okay, cut!

893
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:04,457
You're missing a beat.

894
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:06,999
Can you hear the pilot track?
- Yes.

895
01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:09,457
lncrease the volume in the cans.

896
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:10,999
Okay, take.

897
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:16,999
Cut it Cut it Cut it !

898
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:18,999
Hear it once again.

01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:38,707
Cut Cut Cut...

904
01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:40,874
take a break.

905
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:42,999
Sir, would you like some tea?

906
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:45,082
Let's record his voice first.

Don't give me anything but

Come and take my heart Darling

913
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,165
What is it?

914
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:06,374
Are you playing the song or
are you playing with the song?

915
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:07,999
lt's very simple.

916
01:02:09,166 --> 01:02:13,707
Posted a letter telling
you l am coming to your home

917
01:02:14,333 --> 01:02:18,832
l even sent you an E-mail on your lD
- Cut it.

918
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:22,415
You're not listening.

919
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,707
l can't do this, okay?

920
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:26,832
l don't know why you
were looking for me.

921
01:02:26,916 --> 01:02:28,165
l can't sing...

922
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:29,707
l don't have it in me.

923
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:31,374
You are right.

924
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:33,457
Were you singing out
of tune purposely?

925
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,874
Why would l do that?

926
01:02:34,958 --> 01:02:36,665
Even l could figure out the tune...

927
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:38,374
and you couldn't?

928
01:02:47,958 --> 01:02:49,457
And then somehow...

929
01:02:49,541 --> 01:02:51,040
a miracle happened.

930
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:55,290
Ustad ji...

931
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:56,624
ls that him?

932
01:03:00,291 --> 01:03:01,749
Come in.

933
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,540
Sit here.

934
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,290
l've seen you before.

935
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:10,999
Do you know where?

936
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:13,540
At the shrine of Hazrat Nizamuddin.

937
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:15,832
That was nothing...

938
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,540
l've also seen you before.

939
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,457
On TV.

940
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:34,499
You play that... that thing...

941
01:03:36,958 --> 01:03:37,999
Hey!

942
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:40,707
This is Ustad Jameel Khan.

943
01:03:41,291 --> 01:03:42,499
Padma Bhushan.
[lndian Civilian Award]

944
01:03:42,583 --> 01:03:44,499
Do you know
what Padma Bhushan means?

945
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:46,999
Shehnai.

946
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:48,957
Sorry.

947
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,749
l know you are a well known...

948
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:53,415
legend.

949
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,374
But classical music...

950
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,332
you see, l don't
understand it too much.

951
01:04:00,458 --> 01:04:01,999
l get bored.

952
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:04,832
Why do they play the
same tune over and over...

953
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,374
Everybody's heard it...

954
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:07,957
move on, play something else.

955
01:04:12,791 --> 01:04:14,665
He is a big animal...

956
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:19,124
he won't fit into your small cage.

957
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,457
He will create his own music.

958
01:04:22,541 --> 01:04:23,999
Ustadji, you can't be serious...
this guy...

959
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:26,457
He is something else.

960
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:28,165
God has blessed him.

961
01:04:28,291 --> 01:04:29,999
He has His grace.

962
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:33,165
Trust me...

963
01:04:34,166 --> 01:04:35,832
take a chance on him.

964
01:04:36,125 --> 01:04:37,874
You will make a fortune.

965
01:04:55,583 --> 01:04:56,665
Hello...

966
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,040
Hi.

967
01:04:58,125 --> 01:05:00,624
Khatana bhai said you
want to interview me.

968
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:04,749
Jordan...

969
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:07,415
Tell me something.

970
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,290
Why does Mr. Dhingra
have a problem with you?

971
01:05:10,916 --> 01:05:12,540
Come on, l know there's something.

972
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:20,332
Come in...

973
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,707
Press harder.

974
01:05:24,916 --> 01:05:26,457
Happy birthday.

975
01:05:26,541 --> 01:05:28,749
Today you've been born again.

976
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,540
Starting today you are a
Platinum Music artiste.

977
01:05:35,083 --> 01:05:37,999
l heard... your songs
in the 'Sheher' album...

978
01:05:40,166 --> 01:05:41,457
l liked them...

979
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,832
Now you will have your own album...

980
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,582
full solo.

981
01:05:46,666 --> 01:05:47,874
Full solo.

982
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:49,457
Congratulations.

983
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,874
Now you need to learn to...
be a star.

984
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:57,957
The music doesn't really matter.

985
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,665
Lot's of people play music.

986
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:01,540
But everything is image.

987
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:04,999
lmage is everything.

988
01:06:05,041 --> 01:06:06,665
Everything is image.

989
01:06:08,291 --> 01:06:10,374
Bloody idiot! l'll beat you.

990
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:12,999
Leave my hand.
Do you want to kill me.

991
01:06:16,833 --> 01:06:19,957
These days nobody buys music.

992
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:22,915
People buy an image...

993
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,540
a brand.

994
01:06:25,416 --> 01:06:27,332
Just remember that...

995
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:30,290
from today you're not a musician.

996
01:06:30,666 --> 01:06:36,165
What are you?

997
01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:42,999
Stop it!

998
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:46,457
Sorry, sir.

999
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:47,999
Stop it!

1000
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:56,082
The massage is over.

1001
01:06:58,625 --> 01:07:00,999
So that's why you are
not going to Prague!

1002
01:07:01,166 --> 01:07:02,540
Ready!

1003
01:07:02,791 --> 01:07:04,874
Your name didn't feature
in the Eurojam list...

1004
01:07:04,958 --> 01:07:06,540
l was really surprised.

1005
01:07:08,333 --> 01:07:10,082
Don't you know about Eurojam?

1006
01:07:10,166 --> 01:07:12,790
lt's a tie-up between Platinum Music
and the Czech Republic government.

1007
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,499
Dhingra is taking five
lndian musicians to Europe.

1008
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:17,457
Ready?

1009
01:07:17,541 --> 01:07:18,540
Ready, ready...

1010
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:20,124
Just a second,
l need to make a call.

1011
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,624
Sure.

1012
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:23,415
Switch off the microphone.

1013
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,415
Go see where he is gone.

1014
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:39,040
Stars!

1015
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,332
What are you looking at,
let's pack up.

1016
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,082
Mr. Dhingra...

1017
01:07:46,166 --> 01:07:47,457
take me to Europe.

1018
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:48,582
How did you get inside?

1019
01:07:48,666 --> 01:07:50,082
l'll sign your contract...

1020
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,707
l'll do anything you ask me to.

1021
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:54,624
Take me to Europe.

1022
01:07:58,333 --> 01:07:59,832
Don't feel like laughing today?

1023
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:02,915
No, sir.

1024
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:04,374
Not even a little bit?

1025
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:05,790
Come here...

1026
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:07,790
l want to go, sir.

1027
01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:11,082
Why do you want to go?

1028
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:12,457
What's the real reason?

1029
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:13,790
Sir...

1030
01:08:14,125 --> 01:08:15,957
l'm willing to sign anything today.

1031
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:18,165
Just take me to Europe!

1032
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:24,290
You will sign a special contract.

1033
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:25,749
As you wish.

1034
01:08:25,833 --> 01:08:27,707
The clauses will be severe,
everyone here is a witness.

1035
01:08:27,791 --> 01:08:29,749
They are also witness
to what l've said, sir.

1036
01:08:30,666 --> 01:08:31,999
Anything you say.

1037
01:08:47,875 --> 01:08:48,999
Like anything?

1038
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,707
Heer! All done?

1039
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:52,040
Are you buying something?

1040
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,332
Why don't you ever buy
something for yourself?

1041
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:56,165
l should like something.

1042
01:08:56,291 --> 01:08:57,999
So why don't you ever like anything?

1043
01:08:59,291 --> 01:09:01,540
Come here... the
scarves here are lovely.

1044
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:03,332
l have an appointment.

1045
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:06,124
You enjoy going to
the doctor, don't you?

1046
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:07,499
Why are you going now?

1047
01:09:07,583 --> 01:09:09,457
All your tests are negative.

1048
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:10,874
Psychiatrist.

1049
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:12,332
You know...

1050
01:09:12,416 --> 01:09:13,999
l can be your psychiatrist.

1051
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:16,082
You need something to keep you busy.

1052
01:09:16,166 --> 01:09:17,332
Like a job.

1053
01:09:17,416 --> 01:09:18,582
The doctor says the same thing.

1054
01:09:18,666 --> 01:09:20,165
You were a superhot
bombshell in Delhi...

1055
01:09:20,291 --> 01:09:21,499
super busy.

1056
01:09:21,708 --> 01:09:23,957
Here you've got nothing to do,
that's why you feel down.

1057
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,290
l'm sorry...

1058
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,582
l don't know why...

1059
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:28,040
You don't have to be sorry.

1060
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:29,165
God, Heer!

1061
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:30,874
l've troubled everyone...

1062
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:31,999
l know...

1063
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:33,082
You know what?

1064
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:35,082
You should go see a psychiatrist.

1065
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:37,582
Here you are.
- Bye. - Bye.

1066
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:56,999
Hey 'Wild Youth'!

1067
01:10:09,791 --> 01:10:10,999
Here l am...

1068
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:12,999
in Prague.

1069
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:16,707
Let's get some cheap thrills.

1070
01:10:21,791 --> 01:10:22,915
Come on!

1071
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:26,457
l have an appointment...

1072
01:10:27,708 --> 01:10:29,040
with the psychiatrist.

1073
01:10:29,333 --> 01:10:30,624
So you've finally gone mad?

1074
01:10:30,833 --> 01:10:32,415
l can't come right now.

1075
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:33,790
l need to go.

1076
01:10:33,875 --> 01:10:35,749
l'm not keeping too well.

1077
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:38,540
But we'll meet soon. Tomorrow, okay?

1078
01:10:39,083 --> 01:10:40,374
l'll take you for lunch.

1079
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:41,999
At some fancy restaurant.

1080
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:46,165
Where are you staying...

1081
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:50,124
When did you arrive and
what are you doing here?

1082
01:10:52,875 --> 01:10:53,999
Come let's go.

1083
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:03,124
Please take the car home.

1084
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,165
l can't believe you are here!

1085
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:30,415
Welcome to Prague!

1086
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:01,832
l shouldn't be drinking...

1087
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:05,415
Says the drunkard!
- Cheers! - Cheers!

1088
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:09,999
That burns!

1089
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:12,790
When did you start drinking?

1090
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:14,165
Just now!

1091
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:15,832
Let's have another one!

1092
01:12:15,916 --> 01:12:18,457
Really?
- Yes! - Okay. - Cheers!

1093
01:12:30,958 --> 01:12:32,457
Let's make a list.

1094
01:12:38,333 --> 01:12:39,457
Strip show!

1095
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:40,624
Female or male?

1096
01:12:40,708 --> 01:12:41,874
Both!

1097
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:44,082
Next.

1098
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:45,540
Red light district.

1099
01:12:47,416 --> 01:12:48,832
Those cheap pubs.

1100
01:12:49,125 --> 01:12:52,540
Those cheap discotheques
with the tacky lights...

1101
01:12:52,708 --> 01:12:54,374
and shady people.

1102
01:12:55,916 --> 01:12:57,332
You'll dance for them?

1103
01:12:57,583 --> 01:12:58,665
Yes!

1104
01:12:58,750 --> 01:12:59,957
Naughty girl!

1105
01:13:00,791 --> 01:13:01,915
Next!

1106
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:35,999
Feet are decked with wheels

1107
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:39,874
Have spun the skies round and round

1108
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,582
This tale l've heard

1109
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,624
That the queen roams around

1110
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:47,832
On her pretty fair feet

1111
01:13:48,375 --> 01:13:49,582
One blink of an eye

1112
01:13:49,666 --> 01:13:51,332
And the queen was gone

1113
01:13:51,416 --> 01:13:52,832
Then would return

1114
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:54,582
With 12 pairs of
shoes worn out in a day

1115
01:13:54,666 --> 01:13:56,124
The king's temper flew

1116
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:57,874
A spy he called

1117
01:13:57,958 --> 01:13:59,957
What is this mystery?

1118
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:01,999
Find out

1119
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:08,124
Where does she go?

1120
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:13,374
The spy followed the queen

1121
01:14:14,875 --> 01:14:19,082
And saw her at night

1122
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:23,165
Going into hell

1123
01:14:35,958 --> 01:14:37,415
ho... Flames blaze

1124
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,165
ho... Queen mesmerized

1125
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:40,957
ho... Wild dancing

1126
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,624
ho... Everyone poisonous

1127
01:14:42,708 --> 01:14:43,999
ho... Spy shocked

1128
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:45,749
ho... Sneaked out

1129
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:48,040
ho... He told the king

1130
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:51,790
The queen vanished into thin air

1131
01:14:51,958 --> 01:14:53,874
She vanished into thin air

1132
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,290
Danced like a dervish

1133
01:14:55,375 --> 01:14:57,415
Left beloved and guard

1134
01:14:57,791 --> 01:14:59,624
Swirled and twirled

1135
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:01,707
Pretty feet never stopped

1136
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,999
Had no shame

1137
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:08,415
She vanished, her
pretty feet never stopped

1138
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,082
The king fumed

1139
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:11,707
This is how everyday

1140
01:15:11,791 --> 01:15:14,415
The queen wears out
12 pairs of shoes

1141
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:18,707
That's how the tale goes

1142
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:24,582
Yet again she vanished

1143
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,040
There is no stopping her feet

1144
01:15:28,333 --> 01:15:31,415
They will walk, they will dance

1145
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:34,665
Here and there merrily

1146
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:25,999
Enraged the king said queen

1147
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,165
Why do you insult me?

1148
01:16:28,291 --> 01:16:30,290
My pride's gone up in smoke

1149
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:32,999
l'm the laughing stock of
every joke

1150
01:16:33,583 --> 01:16:36,540
From today, l forbid
you from stepping out!

1151
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:40,290
Smiling at his words,
the queen said king

1152
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,040
These walls of gold

1153
01:16:45,916 --> 01:16:49,457
Give me no joy

1154
01:16:53,125 --> 01:16:55,707
Give me freedom

1155
01:16:55,791 --> 01:16:58,415
Lord

1156
01:16:59,666 --> 01:17:02,624
Take the wealth and set me free

1157
01:17:16,958 --> 01:17:18,540
Then in gusto

1158
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:20,082
Everyday in abandon

1159
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:21,499
What she had never done

1160
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:23,540
She did with the lowlife

1161
01:17:23,625 --> 01:17:25,165
A flower child

1162
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:26,749
Bright and wild

1163
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:28,332
Roamed, skipped, danced

1164
01:17:28,416 --> 01:17:29,999
Those pretty fair feet

1165
01:17:31,708 --> 01:17:33,374
Those feet

1166
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:48,624
Yet again she vanished

1167
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,290
There is no stopping her feet

1168
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:55,624
They will walk, they will dance

1169
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:57,624
Here There

1170
01:17:57,791 --> 01:17:59,915
Here, there, God knows where

1171
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,874
l think we should kiss now.
- Really? - Yes.

1172
01:18:40,125 --> 01:18:41,790
Why do you think so?

1173
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,415
lt's always the next step.

1174
01:18:43,708 --> 01:18:46,707
lt happens in every movie.
- Logic! - Then?

1175
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:49,999
lt's good that we
are talking about it.

1176
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,457
These matters should be discussed...

1177
01:18:53,958 --> 01:18:56,457
you can't just get
swayed by emotions and...

1178
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:57,832
you've kissed!

1179
01:18:57,916 --> 01:19:00,374
A little precaution goes a long way.

1180
01:19:00,708 --> 01:19:02,665
So let's discuss this in detail...

1181
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:05,999
and arrive at a suitable conclusion.

1182
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,290
See lt's important to
weigh each option thoroughly...

1183
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:09,665
There are a 1000 issues!

1184
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:10,832
My marriage and all...

1185
01:19:10,916 --> 01:19:12,582
We should plan this right...

1186
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:13,915
how do we kiss?

1187
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,499
And which type of kiss?

1188
01:19:15,583 --> 01:19:17,290
And what if we can't stop at a kiss?

1189
01:19:17,375 --> 01:19:18,374
Correct!

1190
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:20,290
lf we keep going at it,
at which point do we stop?

1191
01:19:20,375 --> 01:19:22,499
And in that frenzy, how will
we know we've arrived..

1192
01:19:22,583 --> 01:19:23,874
..at that point... to stop?

1193
01:19:27,958 --> 01:19:29,332
We are items, both of us!

1194
01:19:29,583 --> 01:19:31,874
lmagine if someone heard us...

1195
01:20:00,791 --> 01:20:03,082
Okay... we should stop.

1196
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:05,999
Jordan!

1197
01:20:09,083 --> 01:20:10,290
What the hell?

1198
01:20:10,375 --> 01:20:12,415
What do you think
you're doing?! Get away!

1199
01:20:12,833 --> 01:20:14,082
But why?
- Why?

1200
01:20:14,166 --> 01:20:15,332
You don't know why?

1201
01:20:15,416 --> 01:20:16,957
Because this is wrong!

1202
01:20:18,083 --> 01:20:19,624
Then why doesn't it feel wrong?

1203
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:22,040
Jordan...

1204
01:20:22,125 --> 01:20:24,165
What do you think, huh?

1205
01:20:24,583 --> 01:20:27,374
What even gave you the idea
you could try this with me?

1206
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,832
That was a lot of fun though.

1207
01:21:21,791 --> 01:21:23,499
lt's not a joke.

1208
01:21:23,583 --> 01:21:24,999
Okay?

1209
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:27,540
lt's serious.

1210
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,665
l've kissed before.

1211
01:21:32,166 --> 01:21:33,374
Even had sex.

1212
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:37,665
But what was this?

1213
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:45,832
Listen...

1214
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,374
from this point on...

1215
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:49,790
we could ruin everything...

1216
01:21:50,541 --> 01:21:52,790
but we shouldn't, right?

1217
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,499
So we won't.

1218
01:21:57,458 --> 01:21:58,790
Now you drop me home and...

1219
01:21:58,875 --> 01:22:00,832
we won't meet again after this.

1220
01:22:02,541 --> 01:22:03,999
lt's too late, Heer.

1221
01:22:06,166 --> 01:22:07,540
lt's going to be difficult.

1222
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,999
But that's what will happen.

1223
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:11,624
Okay?

1224
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:13,582
Come on...

1225
01:22:13,666 --> 01:22:14,915
start the motorbike.

1226
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:18,999
Come on!

1227
01:22:19,125 --> 01:22:20,332
Start the bike.

1228
01:22:22,333 --> 01:22:23,999
Let's go... come.

1229
01:22:53,166 --> 01:22:55,040
Hi...

1230
01:22:55,291 --> 01:22:56,707
So you are the friend!

1231
01:22:57,041 --> 01:22:58,332
l'm the sister-in-law.

1232
01:22:58,416 --> 01:22:59,499
Meena.

1233
01:22:59,583 --> 01:23:01,040
So dinner tomorrow, right?

1234
01:23:02,458 --> 01:23:03,915
You haven't told him?

1235
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,665
He is really busy.

1236
01:23:06,166 --> 01:23:08,207
But l'm sure he has dinner.

1237
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,582
Or you don't eat?

1238
01:23:09,666 --> 01:23:11,874
No, no, you have to make it tomorrow.

1239
01:23:11,958 --> 01:23:14,040
We're all very excited to meet you.

1240
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:15,332
Meena!
- Alright.

1241
01:23:16,666 --> 01:23:18,040
Wonderful.

1242
01:23:18,583 --> 01:23:21,915
And we will take good
care of you, don't worry.

1243
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:27,707
Bye.

1244
01:23:28,833 --> 01:23:30,290
Bye.
- Bye.

1245
01:24:01,625 --> 01:24:03,374
l hope you're not in a hurry,
are you?

1246
01:24:03,458 --> 01:24:04,999
No, its nothing like that.

1247
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:06,582
There she is.

1248
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:09,374
Hi... Welcome.

1249
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,165
Jay...

1250
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:12,249
Hi...

1251
01:24:12,333 --> 01:24:13,707
l've heard a lot about you.

1252
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:15,249
Like what?

1253
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:16,999
Good things... from Heer.

1254
01:24:25,208 --> 01:24:26,332
You know something, Jordan.

1255
01:24:26,416 --> 01:24:30,165
Some of my friends are in the
organising committee of your program.

1256
01:24:30,333 --> 01:24:32,040
And they asked me to
volunteer as well...

1257
01:24:32,125 --> 01:24:33,540
And l really wanted to...

1258
01:24:33,708 --> 01:24:35,082
lt would have been a lot of fun...

1259
01:24:35,208 --> 01:24:36,999
But l was busy the whole month...

1260
01:24:37,166 --> 01:24:38,707
So l had to give it up.

1261
01:24:39,083 --> 01:24:41,040
And Jordan, let me tell you...

1262
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:44,540
ever since you've come to Prague
and Heer has been meeting you...

1263
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:46,790
her health has improved considerably.

1264
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:49,832
ln fact, Dr. Cermac was
very happy and surprised.

1265
01:24:50,416 --> 01:24:52,957
You really seem to
have the magic touch...

1266
01:24:53,041 --> 01:24:54,165
You know Heer...

1267
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:55,457
you should join this program.

1268
01:24:55,541 --> 01:24:57,124
Brilliant!
- Oh no!

1269
01:24:57,208 --> 01:24:58,790
Why not? You should.

1270
01:24:58,875 --> 01:25:00,749
Think about it, you
will really enjoy it.

1271
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:09,832
l want to hug you.

1272
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,124
Shut up!

1273
01:25:11,208 --> 01:25:12,624
Heer, l want to hug you.

1274
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:14,332
l'll wait behind the house.

1275
01:25:14,416 --> 01:25:15,624
Have you lost your mind?

1276
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:17,249
Just shut up and leave.

1277
01:25:17,458 --> 01:25:19,499
l'll wait even if you don't come...

1278
01:25:55,875 --> 01:25:57,207
What do you want?

1279
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:29,790
Stop, stop...

1280
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:32,624
Magic touch!

1281
01:26:39,875 --> 01:26:41,957
But how?
- l don't know...

1282
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,207
l don't know how...

1283
01:26:56,666 --> 01:26:59,915
lt's a statement of my helplessness

1284
01:27:00,166 --> 01:27:03,707
Can't control this moment

1285
01:27:05,916 --> 01:27:09,082
lt's a statement of my helplessness

1286
01:27:09,458 --> 01:27:12,915
Can't control this moment

1287
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:18,790
Squeeze out all desire

1288
01:27:21,583 --> 01:27:24,915
Break you in my arms

1289
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:30,874
What l want, l don't know

1290
01:27:31,166 --> 01:27:35,207
Snatch you, let you go

1291
01:27:37,125 --> 01:27:47,415
What do l do at this moment

1292
01:27:52,541 --> 01:27:55,290
What do l do to become calm,

1293
01:27:55,375 --> 01:27:58,999
At peace

1294
01:27:59,208 --> 01:28:00,874
Let there be more

1295
01:28:00,958 --> 01:28:02,665
This noise of breathing

1296
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:04,790
Passion burn brighter

1297
01:28:05,541 --> 01:28:06,957
Let there be more

1298
01:28:07,041 --> 01:28:08,624
This noise of breathing

1299
01:28:08,708 --> 01:28:11,082
Fever rise higher

1300
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:13,207
Let there be more

1301
01:28:13,291 --> 01:28:14,790
Let us meet more

1302
01:28:14,875 --> 01:28:17,332
And burn more

1303
01:28:20,791 --> 01:28:23,999
l meet you for the first time

1304
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:25,999
Each time

1305
01:28:27,041 --> 01:28:31,499
lt's a statement of my helplessness

1306
01:28:39,541 --> 01:28:42,457
Should l snatch you or let you go

1307
01:28:42,666 --> 01:28:45,665
Should l ask for you
or turn you away

1308
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:50,624
What do l do at this moment

1309
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:55,165
What do l do to become calm,

1310
01:28:55,333 --> 01:28:58,624
At peace

1311
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:00,040
Let there be more

1312
01:29:00,125 --> 01:29:01,624
This noise of breathing

1313
01:29:01,708 --> 01:29:03,832
Passion burn brighter

1314
01:29:04,791 --> 01:29:06,207
Let there be more

1315
01:29:06,291 --> 01:29:07,874
This noise of breathing

1316
01:29:07,958 --> 01:29:10,415
Fever rise higher

1317
01:29:11,041 --> 01:29:12,499
Let there be more

1318
01:29:12,583 --> 01:29:13,915
Let us meet more

1319
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,415
And burn more

1320
01:29:48,833 --> 01:29:52,624
l'm knotted up in desire

1321
01:29:54,833 --> 01:29:57,082
Untie me

1322
01:30:00,541 --> 01:30:02,124
l'm a knock

1323
01:30:02,208 --> 01:30:05,624
You're the closed door

1324
01:30:06,791 --> 01:30:08,749
Open up

1325
01:30:12,916 --> 01:30:15,790
Restlessness deep in my mind

1326
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,332
Come let us live this dream

1327
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:21,040
Let there be more

1328
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:22,582
This noise of breathing

1329
01:30:22,666 --> 01:30:24,999
Passion burn brighter

1330
01:30:25,791 --> 01:30:27,082
Let there be more

1331
01:30:27,166 --> 01:30:28,499
Let us meet more

1332
01:30:28,583 --> 01:30:31,374
And burn more

1333
01:30:34,833 --> 01:30:37,374
lt just doesn't stop

1334
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,540
Does not tire

1335
01:30:41,083 --> 01:30:43,582
This storm

1336
01:30:44,166 --> 01:30:46,582
Of breath

1337
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:50,124
Don't even come to know

1338
01:30:50,708 --> 01:30:52,957
What burns where

1339
01:30:53,125 --> 01:30:54,874
With fear

1340
01:30:56,166 --> 01:30:58,624
With body and mind

1341
01:30:59,041 --> 01:31:01,915
All trembling

1342
01:31:02,416 --> 01:31:06,999
With the scorch of desire

1343
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,332
Blazes more

1344
01:31:12,416 --> 01:31:15,499
Fire burns and smoke rises

1345
01:31:15,583 --> 01:31:18,249
There is smoke everywhere

1346
01:31:18,416 --> 01:31:29,124
lt's a statement of my helplessness

1347
01:32:10,875 --> 01:32:13,790
Ustad Jameel Khan was right.

1348
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:15,624
You are a star.

1349
01:32:15,708 --> 01:32:19,582
Son, l'll pay you three
times more than your contract!

1350
01:32:19,958 --> 01:32:22,582
Look at that, a miser like
me is willing to give more!

1351
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:24,957
He is a craze in lndia too.

1352
01:32:25,208 --> 01:32:26,749
Every day there's
something new about him.

1353
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:28,624
He's busy. l'll say bye
on the phone.

1354
01:32:28,708 --> 01:32:31,124
You've kept my
reputation among these people.

1355
01:32:31,458 --> 01:32:34,499
Now do the same in
Barcelona and Paris.

1356
01:32:38,875 --> 01:32:40,207
Artiste... creative...

1357
01:32:40,708 --> 01:32:43,665
Always in their own world...
that's why he is an artiste.

1358
01:32:49,583 --> 01:32:51,165
Just a minute... excuse me.

1359
01:32:51,708 --> 01:32:53,957
Let me just check if Jordan is free.

1360
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:59,374
l'll just be back.

1361
01:33:10,583 --> 01:33:11,707
Bye...

1362
01:33:12,833 --> 01:33:15,415
Bye Jordan. Say bye and let me go.

1363
01:33:17,666 --> 01:33:19,624
They are waiting for me.

1364
01:33:20,041 --> 01:33:21,624
lt will be a problem.

1365
01:33:22,291 --> 01:33:23,707
Let it be a problem.

1366
01:33:23,791 --> 01:33:25,124
lt won't be for you.

1367
01:33:25,208 --> 01:33:26,582
You're going away.

1368
01:33:26,875 --> 01:33:29,457
After that don't you want
me to be happy in my home?

1369
01:33:29,916 --> 01:33:31,290
No.

1370
01:33:31,958 --> 01:33:33,957
l don't want you to
be happy in your home.

1371
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:36,707
Don't you have any feelings at all?

1372
01:33:37,875 --> 01:33:40,749
Really, what do you feel about me?

1373
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:42,999
l feel that you
should be here with me.

1374
01:33:43,333 --> 01:33:44,415
Right now.

1375
01:33:44,541 --> 01:33:45,999
That's all l feel.

1376
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:48,165
Then get lost!

1377
01:33:48,458 --> 01:33:50,124
You only care about yourself.

1378
01:33:50,416 --> 01:33:52,499
lt's always about what you want.

1379
01:33:53,458 --> 01:33:54,749
Come here.

1380
01:33:55,166 --> 01:33:57,290
You are uncouth and rude!

1381
01:33:57,583 --> 01:33:59,582
We wouldn't have lasted six months!

1382
01:33:59,666 --> 01:34:01,374
Thank God you're going away.

1383
01:34:02,458 --> 01:34:04,124
Are you deliberately
fighting with me?

1384
01:34:04,291 --> 01:34:06,457
l can't stand you any longer.

1385
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:08,915
You are deliberately
fighting with me!

1386
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,374
Then what did you think?

1387
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,040
That we would part on a happy note?

1388
01:34:12,125 --> 01:34:14,749
So that when we meet again,
you could have fun with me again?

1389
01:34:16,541 --> 01:34:18,832
Are you mad?
- l was then!

1390
01:34:18,916 --> 01:34:20,582
But not anymore!

1391
01:34:22,541 --> 01:34:24,082
Come here... l want
to say bye properly.

1392
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:25,415
Get lost!

1393
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:26,582
Heer, you come here right now!

1394
01:34:26,666 --> 01:34:27,582
Go to hell!

1395
01:34:27,666 --> 01:34:28,957
Heer, l'm telling you...

1396
01:34:29,041 --> 01:34:30,249
Go to hell!

1397
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:32,915
Never again!

1398
01:35:06,291 --> 01:35:07,707
So Jordan...

1399
01:35:08,625 --> 01:35:10,249
Go to hell!

1400
01:35:11,916 --> 01:35:15,124
All of you... stay away from me!

1401
01:35:32,791 --> 01:35:33,957
What happened?

1402
01:35:35,291 --> 01:35:37,415
l'll get your
boarding pass, come quick.

1403
01:35:37,541 --> 01:35:40,457
But make it quick, tiger! Else
l'll have a nervous breakdown.

1404
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:23,665
Jordan?

1405
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:33,499
What the hell? What are you doing?

1406
01:36:34,875 --> 01:36:36,624
What have you done?

1407
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:38,582
Have you gone mad?
- Heer...

1408
01:36:38,791 --> 01:36:40,124
Stay there... don't move!

1409
01:36:40,208 --> 01:36:41,707
Jay... he won't do anything.

1410
01:36:41,791 --> 01:36:43,082
Don't shoot!

1411
01:36:43,958 --> 01:36:45,374
Don't shoot, don't shoot.
Don't do anything.

1412
01:36:45,458 --> 01:36:48,207
Don't touch him! lt's okay!
lt's fine!

1413
01:36:52,958 --> 01:36:54,249
Heer?

1414
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:56,540
What's going on?

1415
01:36:58,083 --> 01:37:00,290
There! Your plan's worked.

1416
01:37:00,541 --> 01:37:02,915
Now l can never be happy in my home.

1417
01:37:03,375 --> 01:37:05,082
l only wanted to say goodbye.

1418
01:37:05,333 --> 01:37:07,290
Don't show me your
face as long as l live!

1419
01:37:07,375 --> 01:37:09,665
l don't want to see you again!

1420
01:37:11,541 --> 01:37:12,749
Really?

1421
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,499
Get out!

1422
01:38:53,958 --> 01:38:55,915
Today the media isn't
here to cover an artiste.

1423
01:38:56,083 --> 01:38:58,082
lt's here to cover a criminal.

1424
01:38:58,333 --> 01:39:01,582
There are cases of assault and
intrusion against Jordan in Prague.

1425
01:39:01,666 --> 01:39:04,665
Platinum Music has also sued him.

1426
01:39:38,916 --> 01:39:41,874
ln this world

1427
01:39:43,083 --> 01:39:45,874
Of yours

1428
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:49,999
At every step

1429
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:52,749
Man is wrong

1430
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:59,249
Whatever l think is right and do

1431
01:40:00,666 --> 01:40:04,624
You say that it's wrong

1432
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:07,957
lf l am wrong, then who is right?

1433
01:40:08,208 --> 01:40:10,874
All l have to say about
this is 'No comments'.

1434
01:40:10,958 --> 01:40:12,582
How can you call the
press and say 'no comments'?

1435
01:40:12,666 --> 01:40:15,707
Sir, isn't it a fact that you
are releasing Jordan's next album?

1436
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,332
An album of the songs he
recorded for you in Europe?

1437
01:40:18,625 --> 01:40:19,790
No comments.

1438
01:40:20,458 --> 01:40:24,040
The album hits the stores
and the artiste is in prison.

1439
01:40:24,125 --> 01:40:25,457
That is my vision.

1440
01:40:25,541 --> 01:40:29,040
The little boy who grew up in
this courtyard is now behind bars.

1441
01:40:29,208 --> 01:40:31,374
Negative, negative...

1442
01:40:31,666 --> 01:40:33,124
The media loves everything negative.

1443
01:40:33,208 --> 01:40:37,457
This is the very house that Jordan
was kicked out of two years ago.

1444
01:40:37,833 --> 01:40:42,665
To live by my wishes

1445
01:40:45,083 --> 01:40:49,749
should l submit a petition to you?

1446
01:40:52,708 --> 01:40:56,540
That means you have more right on me

1447
01:40:56,625 --> 01:41:01,457
Than l do on myself

1448
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:04,457
My right

1449
01:41:05,166 --> 01:41:07,332
Keep it here

1450
01:41:17,541 --> 01:41:18,790
My right

1451
01:41:18,875 --> 01:41:19,999
Keep it here

1452
01:41:20,083 --> 01:41:21,249
My right

1453
01:41:21,333 --> 01:41:22,457
Keep it here

1454
01:42:01,208 --> 01:42:02,457
Hey

1455
01:42:02,541 --> 01:42:04,624
ln these queues

1456
01:42:04,958 --> 01:42:07,165
And these debts

1457
01:42:07,458 --> 01:42:12,124
Why do you strangle
my habit of living?

1458
01:42:12,208 --> 01:42:14,624
l am uncouth

1459
01:42:14,833 --> 01:42:17,249
l'm from those parts

1460
01:42:17,333 --> 01:42:21,707
Where there is no modesty, no shame

1461
01:42:21,791 --> 01:42:25,207
Heart says that rituals
are the fine of living

1462
01:42:25,291 --> 01:42:26,540
World is enemy

1463
01:42:26,625 --> 01:42:27,832
Everything is anti

1464
01:42:27,916 --> 01:42:29,290
Set them on fire

1465
01:42:29,375 --> 01:42:31,290
My heart tells me

1466
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:34,207
Live by your heart or die

1467
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:19,999
My right

1468
01:43:20,083 --> 01:43:21,290
Keep it here

1469
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:40,124
You know...

1470
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,999
Many years ago there
was a jungle over here.

1471
01:43:45,375 --> 01:43:47,874
A dense and fearsome jungle.

1472
01:43:49,291 --> 01:43:52,165
Then one day, a city
came up in its place.

1473
01:43:52,416 --> 01:43:56,082
Neat and tidy houses, wide roads.

1474
01:43:56,291 --> 01:43:58,999
Everything became planned
and proper.

1475
01:44:00,833 --> 01:44:02,957
But the day the
jungle was torn down...

1476
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:08,124
a flock of birds...

1477
01:44:09,125 --> 01:44:11,249
flew away forever.

1478
01:44:14,291 --> 01:44:15,999
lt never came back.

1479
01:44:19,541 --> 01:44:21,749
l'm looking for those birds.

1480
01:44:25,208 --> 01:44:26,540
Has anyone seen them?

1481
01:44:26,625 --> 01:44:28,332
No!

1482
01:44:28,583 --> 01:44:30,749
Anyone seen them?

1483
01:44:44,791 --> 01:44:46,832
Eco-friendly

1484
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:49,415
Protector of nature

1485
01:44:49,916 --> 01:44:52,124
l too am nature

1486
01:44:54,875 --> 01:44:59,374
With tradition, with society

1487
01:44:59,541 --> 01:45:01,415
Why

1488
01:45:04,833 --> 01:45:06,999
You cut me up into pieces?

1489
01:45:07,083 --> 01:45:10,957
Why do you scatter me like this?

1490
01:45:13,458 --> 01:45:15,707
Why teach lessons of truth

1491
01:45:15,875 --> 01:45:18,165
When you can't handle the truth

1492
01:45:18,250 --> 01:45:20,707
When someone speaks the truth

1493
01:45:20,791 --> 01:45:22,957
You inflict rules
and regulations on him

1494
01:45:23,041 --> 01:45:24,915
Your fear

1495
01:45:25,583 --> 01:45:27,415
Your love

1496
01:45:27,916 --> 01:45:29,915
Your praise

1497
01:45:30,416 --> 01:45:32,832
Keep to yourself

1498
01:45:33,541 --> 01:45:34,790
My right

1499
01:45:34,875 --> 01:45:36,249
Keep it here

1500
01:46:33,791 --> 01:46:36,999
lt seems like Jordan can't
handle his new found success.

1501
01:46:37,416 --> 01:46:39,290
This crowd here in Lucknow
can't believe that..

1502
01:46:39,375 --> 01:46:41,040
..he didn't show up for his concert.

1503
01:46:41,375 --> 01:46:43,249
When its quite clear that...

1504
01:46:43,333 --> 01:46:46,540
he was seen coming out of the
Lucknow airport this morning.

1505
01:46:46,916 --> 01:46:48,332
Has he lost it?

1506
01:46:50,125 --> 01:46:51,790
You want me to lock him up again?

1507
01:46:57,958 --> 01:46:59,624
Dhingra sir...
- Khatana...

1508
01:47:00,041 --> 01:47:02,124
you better get him back
to his senses.

1509
01:47:04,166 --> 01:47:06,957
Because l really feel like
chopping him into tiny pieces.

1510
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:15,415
Don't sir me!

1511
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:17,040
l'm losing my money, bloody idiot!

1512
01:47:21,625 --> 01:47:22,915
l instructed all of you
to watch his every move.

1513
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,624
Sir, he left of his own will.

1514
01:48:00,916 --> 01:48:03,790
All that l

1515
01:48:04,375 --> 01:48:06,665
Wish to say

1516
01:48:07,791 --> 01:48:10,415
ls ruined by

1517
01:48:11,125 --> 01:48:16,540
My words

1518
01:49:20,958 --> 01:49:22,374
Even this day has come!

1519
01:49:22,625 --> 01:49:24,832
When l have to drag
you out of a brothel.

1520
01:49:25,208 --> 01:49:27,332
You will be finished
even before you start!

1521
01:49:27,416 --> 01:49:28,832
Mark my words.

1522
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,915
Your reputation is
going from bad to worse.

1523
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,582
And you won't even realise
when people start hating you.

1524
01:49:38,041 --> 01:49:40,624
What's happened to you, JJ?

1525
01:49:40,833 --> 01:49:42,707
What are you becoming?

1526
01:49:43,291 --> 01:49:45,290
What's your problem?

1527
01:49:46,083 --> 01:49:48,124
Look at yourself!

1528
01:49:48,375 --> 01:49:50,624
Do you want people
to run away from you?

1529
01:49:57,958 --> 01:49:59,582
You're listening to me, right?

1530
01:50:00,375 --> 01:50:02,499
What l'm saying is very important.

1531
01:50:03,291 --> 01:50:04,957
No, you can't! Get lost!

1532
01:50:05,083 --> 01:50:06,374
You can't talk like that!

1533
01:50:06,708 --> 01:50:08,165
Who do you think you are?

1534
01:50:11,666 --> 01:50:12,999
Anyone who meets you...

1535
01:50:13,208 --> 01:50:14,749
gets put off by you!

1536
01:50:15,916 --> 01:50:18,249
Your popularity is going down...

1537
01:50:18,625 --> 01:50:19,790
do you know that?

1538
01:50:21,333 --> 01:50:23,415
All l want to know is that...

1539
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:26,874
you should...

1540
01:50:27,458 --> 01:50:28,832
Yes, Khatana bhai?

1541
01:50:31,458 --> 01:50:32,790
Khatana bhai.

1542
01:50:33,125 --> 01:50:34,874
l understand what
you're trying to tell me.

1543
01:50:36,625 --> 01:50:38,415
l don't know why l act like this.

1544
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:40,415
l can't seem to control myself.

1545
01:50:41,583 --> 01:50:44,332
l don't like it.
l don't even like myself.

1546
01:50:47,416 --> 01:50:48,915
Shouldn't l be happy right now?

1547
01:50:49,875 --> 01:50:51,582
This is what l wanted.

1548
01:50:52,958 --> 01:50:54,415
But happiness is nowhere in sight.

1549
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:55,790
lt doesn't exist.

1550
01:50:57,916 --> 01:50:59,415
lt's like...

1551
01:51:00,125 --> 01:51:01,582
only...

1552
01:51:02,166 --> 01:51:04,624
as if bugs are biting me from inside.

1553
01:51:04,708 --> 01:51:06,124
All the time.

1554
01:51:06,666 --> 01:51:08,457
And all the time l'm... like this...

1555
01:51:10,166 --> 01:51:11,665
l...

1556
01:51:13,208 --> 01:51:14,874
even l...

1557
01:51:28,041 --> 01:51:29,415
Stop calling out my name!

1558
01:51:30,708 --> 01:51:32,249
How long does it take?

1559
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:15,207
Now do you believe me? This is JJ...

1560
01:52:15,416 --> 01:52:16,915
Come, come, let's take a picture.

1561
01:52:17,125 --> 01:52:18,207
Photo...

1562
01:52:18,291 --> 01:52:20,457
Of course, we need some proof!

1563
01:52:35,833 --> 01:52:36,999
Sweety, come on.

1564
01:52:38,041 --> 01:52:39,249
Now it's my turn...

1565
01:52:39,333 --> 01:52:40,749
Talk to me, at least.

1566
01:52:43,666 --> 01:52:44,915
Smile please.

1567
01:52:59,750 --> 01:53:01,332
Anybody else wants a photo?

1568
01:53:03,833 --> 01:53:05,165
No more pictures?

1569
01:53:07,666 --> 01:53:08,915
You guys done?

1570
01:53:10,666 --> 01:53:11,957
Should l leave?

1571
01:53:44,916 --> 01:53:46,415
Sir...

1572
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:47,832
a five-album contract?

1573
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,249
And he can't perform anywhere else.

1574
01:53:50,333 --> 01:53:51,665
Sir, isn't that too much?

1575
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:53,332
Fine, don't sign. lt's okay.

1576
01:53:53,416 --> 01:53:54,790
Sir, sir...

1577
01:53:54,875 --> 01:53:56,249
l've decided...

1578
01:53:56,333 --> 01:53:57,499
you can stay at home.

1579
01:53:57,583 --> 01:53:59,082
Sir, just take a look...

1580
01:53:59,166 --> 01:54:01,332
Sir, l agree with
everything you say except...

1581
01:54:24,375 --> 01:54:28,165
Om "May auspices chase
away the darkness" swaha

1582
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:31,124
"My life is in your hands" swaha

1583
01:54:31,541 --> 01:54:35,082
Om "Agreement can go to hell" swaha

1584
01:54:36,458 --> 01:54:39,082
"Dhingra, you've been thrammed" swaha

1585
01:54:39,166 --> 01:54:41,790
Such an insult of Mr. Dhingra!
That too of Mr. Dhingra!

1586
01:54:41,958 --> 01:54:45,707
"Everything is image,
image is everything" swaha

1587
01:54:45,916 --> 01:54:47,832
"You've been humiliated" swaha

1588
01:54:48,125 --> 01:54:50,540
"Do what the hell you can" swaha

1589
01:55:01,583 --> 01:55:03,790
So, you're finished with Dhingra...

1590
01:55:05,166 --> 01:55:06,540
what's next?

1591
01:55:06,833 --> 01:55:09,624
Nimbus Records, London.
They want to sign you.

1592
01:55:09,791 --> 01:55:11,749
And they will take over the lawsuits.

1593
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,207
Why are they asking you?

1594
01:55:13,291 --> 01:55:14,624
They are afraid of you.

1595
01:55:14,833 --> 01:55:16,582
lt's this image you have.

1596
01:55:16,708 --> 01:55:18,999
They thought l'm close to you and...

1597
01:55:19,333 --> 01:55:20,749
Are you?

1598
01:55:21,333 --> 01:55:22,582
What?

1599
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,415
Close?

1600
01:56:03,708 --> 01:56:05,457
You can't forget her, can you?

1601
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:12,249
Jordan, the Casanova.

1602
01:56:13,416 --> 01:56:14,957
The bad boy of music.

1603
01:56:16,708 --> 01:56:18,957
Secretly burning in someone's love.

1604
01:56:20,375 --> 01:56:21,790
How cute!

1605
01:56:32,041 --> 01:56:33,499
lt will never happen, Jordan.

1606
01:56:35,708 --> 01:56:37,165
l am not Heer.

1607
01:56:44,833 --> 01:56:46,332
lt's a story.

1608
01:56:48,333 --> 01:56:49,665
Front page.

1609
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:24,124
We need to talk.

1610
01:58:25,083 --> 01:58:26,999
Not in this condition, Heer.

1611
01:58:28,666 --> 01:58:30,957
l have Bone Marrow Aplasia, Jay.

1612
01:58:32,083 --> 01:58:34,374
l'm not getting better.

1613
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:38,165
My condition will only worsen.

1614
01:58:40,958 --> 01:58:43,249
So, what do you want to do?

1615
01:58:44,541 --> 01:58:46,290
You tell me.

1616
01:58:48,125 --> 01:58:50,415
l've been unfaithful to you, Jay.

1617
01:58:51,541 --> 01:58:53,540
l've crossed the line.

1618
01:58:55,458 --> 01:58:58,165
l knew all along l was
doing something wrong.

1619
01:58:59,583 --> 01:59:01,374
l knew it every second.

1620
01:59:02,208 --> 01:59:06,249
l was trying hard to
stop myself but...

1621
01:59:08,166 --> 01:59:09,707
l don't know why...

1622
01:59:10,041 --> 01:59:12,165
l don't know what came over me.

1623
01:59:14,791 --> 01:59:17,249
So what do you feel about him now?

1624
01:59:22,541 --> 01:59:24,707
This feeling will go away.

1625
01:59:26,166 --> 01:59:28,540
With time this will all go away.

1626
01:59:29,375 --> 01:59:31,582
We'll talk after some time then.

1627
02:00:34,625 --> 02:00:37,874
Jordan!

1628
02:00:38,333 --> 02:00:39,624
Mandy...

1629
02:00:39,708 --> 02:00:41,249
Mandy... Heer's sister?

1630
02:00:43,083 --> 02:00:44,457
l need to talk to you.

1631
02:00:44,625 --> 02:00:46,082
Where can l meet you?

1632
02:01:21,333 --> 02:01:22,540
Hey...

1633
02:01:22,875 --> 02:01:24,457
'Wild Youth'!

1634
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,290
Hello...

1635
02:01:31,750 --> 02:01:35,332
Come on wake up, l'm bored.

1636
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,499
You've slept enough.

1637
02:01:50,875 --> 02:01:52,707
This shouldn't have happened...

1638
02:01:53,166 --> 02:01:54,499
Sorry?

1639
02:01:55,708 --> 02:01:56,957
What?

1640
02:02:09,708 --> 02:02:11,332
Can you step outside for a second?

1641
02:02:20,666 --> 02:02:22,040
Shut the door.

1642
02:02:27,791 --> 02:02:29,874
After what happened in Prague...

1643
02:02:31,166 --> 02:02:34,874
how dare you come in to my house?

1644
02:02:36,291 --> 02:02:37,790
Aren't you ashamed at all?

1645
02:02:37,875 --> 02:02:40,124
You will hear from dad.

1646
02:02:43,666 --> 02:02:45,540
You'll never come back here again.

1647
02:02:47,458 --> 02:02:48,832
Go.

1648
02:02:49,958 --> 02:02:51,665
l can't do that.

1649
02:02:53,916 --> 02:02:55,165
l know myself.

1650
02:02:55,250 --> 02:02:56,999
l will definitely stay with Heer.

1651
02:02:58,250 --> 02:02:59,415
Listen...

1652
02:02:59,708 --> 02:03:04,082
Heer is not in any condition to
face any more drama, understand?

1653
02:03:04,416 --> 02:03:07,332
She can't take even a little tension.
She will collapse.

1654
02:03:07,416 --> 02:03:08,832
Precisely!

1655
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:11,540
You know...

1656
02:03:12,041 --> 02:03:13,415
nothing will happen to Heer.

1657
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:14,874
Don't worry.

1658
02:03:16,583 --> 02:03:18,290
You don't believe me, right?

1659
02:03:18,708 --> 02:03:20,790
You think l'm not making any sense?

1660
02:03:21,541 --> 02:03:23,040
But you will see.

1661
02:03:32,708 --> 02:03:33,874
Mom...

1662
02:03:33,958 --> 02:03:35,665
she is dying anyway...

1663
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:37,290
Shut up!

1664
02:03:37,375 --> 02:03:39,832
Your family wants to throw
me out but don't you worry...

1665
02:03:39,916 --> 02:03:41,415
l will come back.

1666
02:03:42,333 --> 02:03:44,082
And before they can come in...

1667
02:03:44,250 --> 02:03:45,790
let's have a quick kiss.

1668
02:03:48,916 --> 02:03:49,957
Jordan!

1669
02:03:50,041 --> 02:03:52,082
Quick... they'll come in...
- Stop it... stay right there.

1670
02:03:52,166 --> 02:03:53,207
But we don't have time.

1671
02:03:53,291 --> 02:03:54,582
Shut up! Move away!

1672
02:03:54,666 --> 02:03:57,124
Listen Heer, l will kiss you,
no matter what you do.

1673
02:03:57,208 --> 02:03:58,707
Jordan, don't... l will kill you.

1674
02:03:58,791 --> 02:04:00,124
Okay, on your cheek...

1675
02:04:00,208 --> 02:04:01,165
Have you lost it?

1676
02:04:01,250 --> 02:04:02,999
Come on...
by now we would've done it!

1677
02:04:03,083 --> 02:04:05,124
Jordan, l swear... l will...

1678
02:04:06,250 --> 02:04:07,582
What happened?

1679
02:04:09,041 --> 02:04:11,582
How are you standing?

1680
02:04:23,291 --> 02:04:24,957
She's just the same.

1681
02:04:25,666 --> 02:04:27,457
But she was on her feet!

1682
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:29,499
She didn't get out of
bed for three weeks.

1683
02:04:29,583 --> 02:04:30,624
That's a good thing, right?

1684
02:04:30,708 --> 02:04:32,290
But how?

1685
02:04:37,125 --> 02:04:39,082
You want to talk to him?

1686
02:04:39,791 --> 02:04:41,290
What are you doing, Mandy?

1687
02:04:41,375 --> 02:04:43,082
So, that's a no?

1688
02:04:44,625 --> 02:04:46,499
Why doesn't he get it?

1689
02:04:46,666 --> 02:04:48,082
Hello...

1690
02:04:48,166 --> 02:04:50,915
She doesn't want to talk to you.
- Give me the phone.

1691
02:04:53,583 --> 02:04:55,540
Listen...
- When will you die?

1692
02:05:00,250 --> 02:05:01,374
Hello?

1693
02:05:02,083 --> 02:05:03,874
Hello Heer?
- Yes, what?

1694
02:05:04,041 --> 02:05:06,582
The doctor said you are dying, right?

1695
02:05:07,083 --> 02:05:08,707
So when are you dying?

1696
02:05:09,125 --> 02:05:10,332
Even this is a joke?

1697
02:05:10,416 --> 02:05:13,249
Not at all, it's serious.

1698
02:05:14,416 --> 02:05:16,415
Your factory doesn't
produce blood anymore...

1699
02:05:16,708 --> 02:05:18,040
What do you want?

1700
02:05:18,541 --> 02:05:19,999
l want to ask you...

1701
02:05:20,458 --> 02:05:23,332
if there is a security
alarm system in your house?

1702
02:05:23,416 --> 02:05:24,332
Why?

1703
02:05:24,416 --> 02:05:25,707
What are you going to do?

1704
02:05:25,791 --> 02:05:27,124
Just asking...

1705
02:05:28,208 --> 02:05:30,540
The security system in
Prague was very loud.

1706
02:05:31,416 --> 02:05:34,207
Even the lights came on immediately.

1707
02:05:35,541 --> 02:05:37,457
The whole situation changed.

1708
02:05:38,791 --> 02:05:41,249
l had no idea such
security systems existed.

1709
02:05:41,833 --> 02:05:43,707
Some really hi-tech stuff.

1710
02:05:49,833 --> 02:05:52,082
You shouldn't have stepped out.

1711
02:05:52,625 --> 02:05:54,082
Now...

1712
02:05:55,291 --> 02:05:57,332
l will have to come to you.

1713
02:05:59,625 --> 02:06:00,915
Jordan...

1714
02:06:02,833 --> 02:06:04,499
don't do this.

1715
02:06:06,250 --> 02:06:08,624
l won't be able to bear it.

1716
02:06:09,541 --> 02:06:11,290
l'm doing this?

1717
02:06:14,166 --> 02:06:16,582
You said you didn't
want to see me again...

1718
02:06:16,791 --> 02:06:18,540
did l try to meet you?

1719
02:06:20,208 --> 02:06:22,832
Did l even call you
in the last two years?

1720
02:06:24,916 --> 02:06:28,207
l tried not to even think about you.

1721
02:06:29,916 --> 02:06:31,749
But what happened?

1722
02:06:32,458 --> 02:06:34,290
Here you are...

1723
02:06:34,916 --> 02:06:37,207
standing in front of me.

1724
02:06:38,458 --> 02:06:40,832
Don't you get it, Heer?

1725
02:06:43,083 --> 02:06:44,999
This is something else.

1726
02:06:45,333 --> 02:06:47,582
That's bringing you and me together.

1727
02:06:48,875 --> 02:06:50,749
We couldn't stay apart, right?

1728
02:06:51,333 --> 02:06:52,790
We couldn't.

1729
02:06:54,666 --> 02:06:56,999
l'm such a big celebrity, Heer.

1730
02:06:57,250 --> 02:06:58,957
l'm a star!

1731
02:06:59,541 --> 02:07:02,457
l'm rich and famous...

1732
02:07:02,833 --> 02:07:04,957
but l'm only burning inside...

1733
02:07:05,041 --> 02:07:06,749
there's a restlessness...

1734
02:07:10,583 --> 02:07:14,457
l'm only good with you,
it's that simple.

1735
02:07:15,666 --> 02:07:17,499
And it's the same with you.

1736
02:07:17,875 --> 02:07:21,082
When l'm not around, you get afflicted
with a life threatening illness...

1737
02:07:21,166 --> 02:07:23,832
your body stops producing blood.

1738
02:07:26,750 --> 02:07:28,957
l'm dying, Jordan!

1739
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:31,999
Perhaps a few months or...

1740
02:07:32,875 --> 02:07:34,332
a year.

1741
02:07:35,208 --> 02:07:38,040
After that l'll be dead.

1742
02:07:38,791 --> 02:07:40,374
And what if you don't die?

1743
02:07:41,708 --> 02:07:43,582
What if nothing happens to you?

1744
02:07:45,083 --> 02:07:46,332
Then will you be mine?

1745
02:07:49,416 --> 02:07:50,624
Jordan...

1746
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,124
can you hug me?

1747
02:07:58,333 --> 02:07:59,665
Hello?

1748
02:08:10,541 --> 02:08:11,999
What is it?

1749
02:08:12,166 --> 02:08:16,165
He's coming...

1750
02:08:56,708 --> 02:08:57,874
Heer?

1751
02:09:03,041 --> 02:09:04,749
Are you in a hurry?

1752
02:09:06,666 --> 02:09:08,832
Hold me closer... tighter!

1753
02:10:33,416 --> 02:10:35,207
You are like a guitar.

1754
02:10:38,625 --> 02:10:40,082
And these are your
high notes... here...

1755
02:10:47,791 --> 02:10:50,207
Her blood count has improved.

1756
02:10:50,666 --> 02:10:52,082
See...

1757
02:10:56,250 --> 02:10:58,457
And you think this
is because of Jordan?

1758
02:11:01,875 --> 02:11:03,624
Do you know what
kind of a person he is?

1759
02:11:03,916 --> 02:11:05,082
Virath...

1760
02:11:05,583 --> 02:11:06,915
two weeks ago...

1761
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,457
Heer didn't even have
the strength to talk.

1762
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:12,832
Despite all our
efforts she was sinking.

1763
02:11:12,916 --> 02:11:14,915
Her condition was
getting worse by the day.

1764
02:11:15,666 --> 02:11:18,207
Now she goes for a walk...

1765
02:11:18,583 --> 02:11:20,499
comes down for breakfast...

1766
02:11:20,833 --> 02:11:22,374
and this blood report!

1767
02:11:24,375 --> 02:11:25,915
Whatever it is and...

1768
02:11:26,250 --> 02:11:27,999
however it might be happening...

1769
02:11:28,250 --> 02:11:30,457
you think l'm going to intervene?

1770
02:11:30,541 --> 02:11:31,874
Or stop it?

1771
02:11:32,291 --> 02:11:35,457
Listen Neena, she may look cheerful
from the outside..

1772
02:11:35,541 --> 02:11:37,790
..but internally she is very weak.

1773
02:11:37,958 --> 02:11:39,499
Even a little blood loss,
could prove fatal.

1774
02:11:39,583 --> 02:11:41,082
You've already said this.

1775
02:11:41,291 --> 02:11:43,082
We are taking all the
necessary precautions, right?

1776
02:11:43,375 --> 02:11:45,082
Neena please.

1777
02:11:45,333 --> 02:11:46,665
Be logical.

1778
02:11:47,791 --> 02:11:50,790
There have been greater
miracles in this world, Animesh.

1779
02:11:52,166 --> 02:11:54,915
We think we know life...

1780
02:11:55,208 --> 02:11:57,915
but life always
manages to surprise us.

1781
02:12:02,541 --> 02:12:04,290
Wow, Jordan!

1782
02:12:10,750 --> 02:12:12,165
Oh no!

1783
02:12:15,833 --> 02:12:18,582
That's what l wondered,
such a big star...

1784
02:12:19,166 --> 02:12:20,790
doesn't he have to work?

1785
02:12:21,166 --> 02:12:24,040
But every time l ask,
he says "l'm free".

1786
02:12:24,125 --> 02:12:26,290
Twelve recordings, six shows and...

1787
02:12:26,625 --> 02:12:28,415
a product launch have
been cancelled.

1788
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:30,874
Khatana bhai...
- We've been served two legal notices.

1789
02:12:31,916 --> 02:12:33,665
l'm avoiding everyone.

1790
02:12:34,291 --> 02:12:36,790
What do l say?
Even l don't know where he is?

1791
02:12:37,125 --> 02:12:38,540
For the past month...

1792
02:12:39,041 --> 02:12:40,290
his phone has been switched off.

1793
02:12:40,583 --> 02:12:42,124
And here he's using another phone!

1794
02:12:42,541 --> 02:12:43,957
Where is he...

1795
02:12:44,208 --> 02:12:45,707
is he alive or dead...

1796
02:12:45,958 --> 02:12:47,457
By God! So much drama!

1797
02:12:47,541 --> 02:12:49,165
You think this is a joke?

1798
02:12:50,083 --> 02:12:52,040
These international companies...

1799
02:12:52,625 --> 02:12:55,124
they have an army of lawyers...

1800
02:12:55,333 --> 02:12:58,040
whose job is to make life
miserable for people like us.

1801
02:12:58,875 --> 02:13:00,082
That's his style...

1802
02:13:00,166 --> 02:13:01,499
first he scares you
and then saves you.

1803
02:13:01,666 --> 02:13:03,040
But this time you aren't safe.

1804
02:13:03,125 --> 02:13:04,332
Trust me...

1805
02:13:04,416 --> 02:13:06,165
this time you're going to prison.

1806
02:13:06,458 --> 02:13:07,624
See?

1807
02:13:09,208 --> 02:13:10,832
He just doesn't listen.

1808
02:13:11,166 --> 02:13:13,540
l don't understand
what to do with him.

1809
02:13:13,625 --> 02:13:14,832
We'll figure that later.

1810
02:13:14,916 --> 02:13:17,124
What do you want him
to do right now?

1811
02:13:17,500 --> 02:13:18,915
The concert at Kangra.

1812
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,040
And there are more concerts all over.

1813
02:13:21,333 --> 02:13:22,624
Kangra in Himachal Pradesh?

1814
02:13:22,791 --> 02:13:24,040
McLeodgunj!

1815
02:13:24,625 --> 02:13:27,165
The tickets for the concert
have been sold.

1816
02:13:27,291 --> 02:13:29,082
Khatana bhai,
understand this clearly.

1817
02:13:29,250 --> 02:13:30,957
l'm not going to
Kangra or any other place.

1818
02:13:31,041 --> 02:13:32,332
See?

1819
02:13:32,666 --> 02:13:34,165
But l'm going there.

1820
02:13:34,416 --> 02:13:35,665
l want to go.

1821
02:13:36,416 --> 02:13:38,249
l want to go to the hills.

1822
02:13:38,583 --> 02:13:41,082
l want to see the Himalayas again.

1823
02:13:42,125 --> 02:13:43,624
Bike ride...

1824
02:13:43,708 --> 02:13:45,207
sunrise...

1825
02:13:45,291 --> 02:13:47,249
burn a bonfire at night...
getting wet in the rain...

1826
02:13:47,333 --> 02:13:49,749
walking through a forest...
dense forest.

1827
02:13:49,833 --> 02:13:51,999
And smoking a hookah!
- Okay.

1828
02:13:52,208 --> 02:13:54,749
And you know Jordan...
that Rockstar...

1829
02:13:54,958 --> 02:13:57,499
who takes chartered
flights for his concerts.

1830
02:13:57,583 --> 02:13:58,999
Oh, that guy?

1831
02:13:59,083 --> 02:14:01,249
Yes, l want to see him perform live.

1832
02:14:01,333 --> 02:14:03,707
So little time and so much to do!

1833
02:14:18,625 --> 02:14:19,874
Welcome to Himachal Pradesh.

1834
02:14:19,958 --> 02:14:21,165
How do you like it here?

1835
02:14:21,250 --> 02:14:23,749
Jordan, we've seen her picture
on You Tube. What is her name?

1836
02:14:23,833 --> 02:14:25,332

02:35:01,916 --> 02:35:06,707
You are meant for me

2026
02:35:07,500 --> 02:35:10,040
Meant for me

2027
02:35:10,291 --> 02:35:13,290
ln a way that

2028
02:35:14,625 --> 02:35:19,540
l've lost myself to you

2029
02:35:20,041 --> 02:35:24,249
And you l have won
