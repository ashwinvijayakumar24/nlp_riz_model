1
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,708
Oh, my!

2
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,541
See how beautiful you look!

3
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,041
Now listen to me carefully,

4
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,833
do as Jagan says.

5
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,125
Don't open your mouth.

6
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,750
Just spread your legs.

7
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,791
Go in, sir. Enjoy!

8
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,083
Please let me go!

9
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,166
No.

10
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,958
I want to go home.

11
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,041
No...

12
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:03,875
Hey, mister...

13
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,708
Hey, you!

14
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,083
Please open the door...

15
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,666
Mother!

16
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,875
Rashmibai!

17
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:32,000
The girl has been crying
nonstop for three days.

18
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,708
Clients keep us up at night,
and she, in the day!

19
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:39,000
Madam, she's a 14 year old child.

20
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,583
Don't keep hitting her.

21
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,041
If she dies, you'll get arrested.

22
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,958
So, what do I do?

23
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,416
Send her back home?

24
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,125
Don't do anything.

25
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,250
Just call Gangubai.

26
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,333
What will that smart-ass do?

27
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:59,833
If there's anyone who can get
the girl to give in, it's Gangubai.

28
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,125
Think about it...

29
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,000
She's right, madam.

30
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,541
It's time you call Gangubai.

31
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,708
Gangu, the infamous one!

32
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,625
<i>Adept at changing colors,</i>
<i>like a chameleon!</i>

33
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,166
<i>With one look she touches your heart.</i>

34
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:28,916
<i>She scorns at love,</i>
<i>but she's soft-hearted.</i>

35
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:39,916
Have we arrived?

36
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,333
{\an8}We've run out of gas.

37
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,291
{\an8}RANI CHAAP
No. 1 ALCOHOL

38
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:46,166
{\an8}So thanks to you,
I will have to walk

39
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,000
and make a fool of myself.

40
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,333
Open the door.

41
00:06:54,208 --> 00:07:00,541
<i>She shines and glows</i>

42
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,541
<i>She shines and glows</i>

43
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,166
<i>She shines...</i>

44
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:08,791
Salaam, madam.

45
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,250
Namaskar, Gangubai.

46
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:17,916
Greetings, madam.

47
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:21,958
Gangubai!

48
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,416
Over here.

49
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,666
Rashmibai!

50
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,916
I've come here after so long,
I forgot.

51
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,166
What happened to you?
You were one wildcat.

52
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:35,041
-Now you look like a washed out rag.
-What to do, Gangubai?

53
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,958
Business is slow,

54
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,166
and this new girl is also acting up!

55
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,000
But every time you come,

56
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,541
things brighten up.

57
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,208
You know what people say.

58
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,916
Nights in Kamathipura
are always moonlit.

59
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,166
Ask me why?

60
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,333
Because Gangu lives there!

61
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,958
Gangu was, is and will
always be shining like the moon.

62
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,291
-Where's the girl?
-Inside.

63
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,125
Great, Rashmi.

64
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,500
As expected from you...

65
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,166
What could I do?
She's an animal.

66
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:20,583
-She bit Mr. Jagan as well--
-Close the door and leave.

67
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,583
Fine, I'm leaving.

68
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,583
Have some water.

69
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,333
I'm offering it with love.
Just drink it.

70
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,708
What's your name?

71
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,375
-They beat me a lot.
-Name?

72
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,000
Madhu.

73
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,625
I can't stay here.

74
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:16,833
Madhu...

75
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,750
Once you enter Kamathipura,

76
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,208
there's no going back.

77
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,208
Give me your hand.

78
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,125
There was a girl like you
who went back home.

79
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,250
Her family publicly hanged her to death.

80
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,000
Who brought you here?

81
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,458
Jameel...

82
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,166
How were you related to him?

83
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,583
I was his wife.

84
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,750
And he made you play
"wife" to the world?

85
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,916
Everyone here has the same story.

86
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,291
Every night is a wedding night
with a new husband.

87
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,791
Where did you say you're from?

88
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,958
Ratnagiri.

89
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,625
I am from Kathiawar.

90
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,041
I was a barrister's daughter,

91
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,916
Ganga Jagjeevandas Kathiawadi.

92
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,833
I used to belong to a prestigious family.

93
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,791
<i>The dancing, twirling damsel</i>

94
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,250
<i>Where are you off to?</i>

95
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,125
<i>With strings tied to the wind</i>

96
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,250
<i>The dancing, twirling damsel</i>

97
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,875
<i>Where are you off to?</i>

98
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,708
<i>With strings tied to the wind</i>

99
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,750
<i>As she casts away her shyness</i>

100
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,125
<i>Her eyes speak</i>

101
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,833
<i>Let her go wild tonight</i>

102
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,916
<i>The dancing, twirling damsel</i>

103
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,583
<i>Where are you off to?</i>

104
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,708
<i>With strings tied to the wind</i>

105
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,916
<i>Running through the streets</i>

106
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,583
<i>Neither asleep nor awake</i>

107
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,041
<i>She hops and skips</i>

108
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,708
<i>Like the moonlight</i>

109
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,375
<i>Chased by the moon</i>

110
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,291
<i>Running through the streets</i>

111
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,875
<i>Neither asleep nor awake</i>

112
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,500
<i>She hops and skips</i>

113
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,083
<i>Like the moonlight</i>

114
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,333
<i>Chased by the moon</i>

115
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,916
<i>The dancing, twirling damsel</i>

116
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,583
<i>Where are you off to?</i>

117
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,291
<i>With strings tied to the wind</i>

118
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,125
<i>As she casts away her shyness</i>

119
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,791

120
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,833

122
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,041
<i>Where are you off to?</i>

123
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,708
<i>With strings tied to the wind</i>

124
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,875
Idiot! Where have you been?

125
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,750
-Why didn't you come for <i>garba</i>?
-Relax.

126
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,791
See what I've got for you.

127
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:07,958
Whoa!

128
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,000
A ticket to Bombay!

129
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,583
Your aunt spoke to the movie producer?

130
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:13,541
Obviously!

131
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,416
She's well-connected in Bombay.

132
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,958
They'll feature you
in a movie with Dev Anand.

133
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,708
Hey, save all this drama for the movies.

134
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,041
Start packing.

135
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,333
Okay, wait, let me inform my parents.

136
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,166
Then you'll never be a movie star!

137
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,250
You think your father
will let you work in movies?

138
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,375
-But Ramnik--
-You want to be a star?

139
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,750
Want to make your parents proud?

140
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,375
Do you love me?

141
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,916
-Tell me, do you love me or not?
-Come on...

142
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,416
You won't get this opportunity again.

143
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,208
So, should I keep
the ticket or tear it up?

144
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,125
You love me, right?

145
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,250
Tell me.

146
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,708
-Ramnik.
-Hmm.

147
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,250
-Are you hungry?
-Hmm.

148
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:10,166
Want to eat <i>thepla</i> that my mom made?
There's sweet and spicy pickle too.

149
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,208
You'll love it.

150
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,291
Did you bring the money and jewels?

151
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,125
Of course I did.

152
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,708
But...

153
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,833
We'll return everything to dad
once we're back.

154
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,625
-Of course.
-Promise?

155
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,625
I promise.

156
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,041
Damn!

157
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,375
What happened?

158
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,666
I've brought mom's cupboard keys with me.

159
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,833
-What will happen now?
-Nothing.

160
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:42,916
What do you mean?

161
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,333
Dad's new shirt is in the cupboard.
What will he wear for the prayers?

162
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,000
He'll wear something else.

163
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,000
-Give me, I'll carefully--
-No!

164
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,666
I won't give my mother's keys to anyone!

165
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,041
Fine, keep them.

166
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,166
-Ramnik...
-Yes?

167
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:02,041
Along with the keys,
my mom must be searching for me too.

168
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What if my parents never forgive me?

169
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,041
Once your movies hit the theatres,

170
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:11,375
not just your parents,
but all of Kathiawar will forgive you!

171
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,916
Cheer up.
We're going to Bombay!

172
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,458
<i>Ramnik, I'm hungry!</i>

173
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:36,083
<i>-How far is your aunt's house?</i>
<i>-Relax. We're almost there.</i>

174
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,583
-Ew, it's so dirty--
-Hush... Softly.

175
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,666
Ew, your aunt lives here?

176
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,083
Not everyone is a barrister like your dad.

177
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,375
Shut up, idiot!

178
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,666
Here comes a new one.

179
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:57,916
Ramnik.

180
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,166
I don't like it here.

181
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,375
These girls are dressed weirdly.

182
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,041
Who sleeps during the day?

183
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,250
Let's go back.

184
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:08,000
My aunt teaches acting all night.
Everyone is resting now.

185
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,041
I don't want to act. Let's go.

186
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,791
Won't you become a movie star?

187
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,375
How will you face your dad?

188
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,000
Sit down, sit.

189
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,333
I'll meet my aunt,
the producer must be here.

190
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,958
-Be back soon, Ramnik.
-Yes.

191
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:24,958
Hey,

192
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,291
want some tea?

193
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,083
Ramnik...

194
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,208
Ganga?

195
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,583
Yes.

196
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:53,458
Ramnik sure has good taste.

197
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,416
Uh, Ramnik--

198
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,625
I'm his aunt.

199
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:58,500
You--

200
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,666
And now yours too.

201
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,583
Aunt Sheela.

202
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,458
Come here.

203
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,125
Come.

204
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,125
Sit.

205
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,750
Aunt Sheela, Ramnik--

206
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,708
He loves you a lot.

207
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,875
He requested me to change your destiny.

208
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:23,541
I said, let's... change your destiny.

209
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,708
Ramnik had come in--

210
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,500
Ramnik! Ramnik! Ramnik!

211
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,958
Love is painful indeed.

212
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,333
Your beloved is inside, unpacking.

213
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:39,875
May I go?

214
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,625
Of course.

215
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:44,791
Ramnik?

216
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,541
Ramnik?

217
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,791
Aunt Sheela...

218
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,708
No! Oh, no!

219
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,791
Why did you shut the door?

220
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,166
Listen... open the door, please!

221
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,375
Please open the door!

222
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,708
Aunt Sheela!

223
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,083
Someone has locked me in, Aunt Sheela!

224
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,541
Ramnik, what kind of a joke is this!

225
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,708
Ramnik, what...

226
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,791
Aunt Sheela, the door...

227
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,375
No!

228
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,625
Open the door, please!

229
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,708
Mom!

230
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,833
Here, have some water.

231
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,166
You haven't had anything in two days.
Drink this.

232
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,250
I want to go home.

233
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,541
And how will you face your family?

234
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,583
Your beloved

235
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,875
sold you off for Rs. 1,000.

236
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,625
This is Sheela's brothel,

237
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,541
and she's the boss here!

238
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:17,958
Understood?

239
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:23,458
You have two days to decide and comply.

240
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:29,583
Or else, there are people here
who will use force and pay for it too.

241
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:42,875
-Hey, mister!
-Take her!

242
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:50,375
<i>My body, my dreams and my trust were sold</i>
<i>for just Rs. 1,000 by someone I loved.</i>

243
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:57,416
<i>Any glimmer of hope that I had</i>
<i>was killed in the next six days.</i>

244
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,791
<i>I was branded as one</i>
<i>of the whores of Kamathipura.</i>

245
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,833
<i>How could I go back home?</i>

246
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,833
<i>The brothel was my new home,</i>

247
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,916
<i>and, I was a prostitute.</i>

248
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,041
Hey! Enough with the makeup!

249
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,625
Time for business.

250
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,500
The clients are interested
in your body, not your face.

251
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,375
Hurry up!

252
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,583
Hey, boy, come to me!

253
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:33,875
Look at her.

254
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:27,875
Come.

255
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,833
Bloody hell! Someone light a candle!

256
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,833
Ganga, Mr. Govind was very happy.

257
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,375
He has left you a big tip.
Take this.

258
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:40,875
Not Ganga.

259
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,333
He has given me a new name...

260
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,625
Gangu!

261
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:54,166
He also said that one day,
I will rule over Kamathipura.

262
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,916
He has lost his mind.

263
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:00,416
Here...

264
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,791
your first earning.

265
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,833
What the hell are you doing?

266
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,458
I'm cremating the old Ganga.

267
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,833
Gangu is hungry, Aunt Sheela.

268
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,666
Where can I get some food?

269
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,625
<i>Everything changed overnight.</i>

270
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:32,916
<i>In no time, Ganga had been sold off.</i>

271
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:37,125
<i>But Mr. Govind's words stayed with me.</i>

272
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,958
<i>I decided,</i>

273
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,750
<i>I'd rule over this city one day.</i>

274
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,500
<i>Soon,</i>

275
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:47,041
<i>the pawns and their moves were mine.</i>

276
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,583
Kamli... wear this,

277
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:51,166
it'll look good on you.

278
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,541
But this is gold.

279
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:54,875
Darling, just wear it.

280
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,833
Who gave you this?

281
00:23:56,916 --> 00:24:00,166
Gangu has many admirers
who shower her with gifts.

282
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:01,958
Does Aunt Sheela know?

283
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,458
She knows my worth.

284
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,250
She's a smart woman.

285
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:08,125
She won't take me on.

286
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,958
Wait and watch, Kamli.

287
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,833
In the next five years,

288
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:13,916
I'll buy this brothel...

289
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,041
and Sheela as well!

290
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,833
Done with your chitchat?

291
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,375
There are clients waiting outside.

292
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,458
Come on, get to work.

293
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,333
We're not working today.

294
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:30,958
They are going to watch
a movie with Gangu.

295
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:33,250
Today I complete a year here.

296
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,583
Great.

297
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:37,125
While you girls go out and enjoy,

298
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:39,416
am I to bear the loss?

299
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:43,916
Profit and loss are a part of business,
Aunt Sheela.

300
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,250
You entertain the clients tonight.

301
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:50,541
Besides, every office
gives a weekly off too.

302
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,333
You should also take a day off.

303
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:55,666
Let's go, girls.

304
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,333
It's time for aunt to get to work.

305
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,416
Let's go!

306
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:11,458
Come on.

307
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:14,375
See you.

308
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,541
Gangu? Where are you going?

309
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,833
Come.

310
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:43,958
Hey, beautiful, let's go have some fun.

311
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:46,875
I'll take you to the "night show". Come.

312
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:48,791
You...

313
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:54,333
Gangu... What's wrong?

314
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:56,750
Taking me to the night show, huh?

315
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:58,500
Let him go, Gangu.

316
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,125
Can't we enjoy our day off in peace?

317
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:06,791
Let's go.
The movie is about to start.

318
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:18,625
Sister got angry.

319
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,000
Get lost.

320
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:23,916
What a total waste of our evening!

321
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,750
You wasted your money,
and then fighting with that man...

322
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,625
How does it matter?

323
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,833
I saw Dev Anand.

324
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:33,666
Now I'll sleep peacefully.

325
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,833
Gangu!

326
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:36,541
Come on, act like Dev Anand.

327
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:37,500
No.

328
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:40,291
-Come on.
-Just let me sleep.

329
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:41,333
Gangu!

330
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,125
I want to send a letter.
Please write it.

331
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:45,708
You have so many lovers,

332
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:47,458
who all should I write to?

333
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:50,416
To my father.

334
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,291
What should I write?

335
00:26:58,375 --> 00:26:59,916
Write whatever you want.

336
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:01,958
Dear father,

337
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:06,500
Firstly, I want to seek your forgiveness.

338
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:10,041
-For--
-For hurting you.

339
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:14,750
Consider it my stupidity and forgive me.

340
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:19,041
I often think...

341
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:23,375
If only before leaving home,

342
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:25,833
I had seen you...

343
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:29,625
You'd have stopped me.

344
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:34,291
But don't worry about me, Dad.

345
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:37,750
I am happy.

346
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,041
I am doing well.

347
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:44,750
Yours...

348
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,583
Ganga.

349
00:27:58,791 --> 00:27:59,875
Madam.

350
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:01,666
A client is asking for Gangu.

351
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,416
Which customer comes at 4 in the morning?

352
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,458
Hold this.

353
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:09,666
She's sleeping.
Ask him to come tomorrow.

354
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,958
He has come all the way here
only for Gangu.

355
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,125
Oh! Ask him to pay double the amount.

356
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,458
Forget the money,
something's not right about this guy.

357
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:19,541
-Should I throw him out?
-Actually...

358
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:21,291
Let him in.

359
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:24,083
He is perfect for Gangu.

360
00:28:25,541 --> 00:28:26,875
Gangu.

361
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:37,583
Gangu. Wake up.

362
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:40,541
-What do you want?
-There's a new client for you.

363
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:44,291
-At this hour?
-Do we even have fixed hours?

364
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:45,958
Look,

365
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,333
he's paying twice the amount for you.

366
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:49,916
We'll earn a lot.

367
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:52,833
Come on, go and get it over with.

368
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,000
Not like this...

369
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,375
Here's the water.

370
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,166
I'm hungry, Dawood.

371
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,500
Get me an egg roll.

372
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:15,875
At this hour? From where?

373
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:17,583
You'll find it on Grant Road.

374
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:19,416
They'll take a couple of hours.

375
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,333
-I have a bad feeling about this man.
-Just go.

376
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,791
I'm here to look after it, you go.

377
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:27,208
Madam, you're just--

378
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:29,208
Listen, make it quick.

379
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:31,166
Moron.

380
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,375
Aunt Sheela...

381
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:46,791
Aunt Sheela!

382
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:49,416
Aunt Sheela!

383
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:51,583
Aunt Sheela!

384
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,708
Why do you need Sheela?

385
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:57,916
We're here together now.

386
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:07,208
Aunt Sheela!

387
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:09,625
Aunt Sheela!

388
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,333
Aunt Sheela!

389
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:27,125
This is such a nuisance!

390
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:28,791
-Gangu!
-Aunt Sheela!

391
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:33,541
Aunt?

392
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,041
-What's going on?
-Bloody scoundrel!

393
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,666
Open the door!

394
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,541
Are you going to kill her?

395
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:41,500
Why is Gangu screaming?

396
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:44,041
Don't just bang on the door!
Do something!

397
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:45,458
Where are your men?

398
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:46,500
Call Dawood.

399
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:49,250
Where will I find him?
He must be lying somewhere drunk.

400
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:52,083
Go find him.
Open the door!

401
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:54,208
Aunt...

402
00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:56,708
-Open the bloody door!
-Want to go out?

403
00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:59,458
I'm right here, my child, don't worry.

404
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:01,083
Oh, poor Ganga!

405
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:02,166
Aunt...

406
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:06,416
You want to go to her?

407
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:11,291
Go!

408
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,083
She's got 15 stitches on her stomach

409
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:19,458
and four on her lips.

410
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:21,250
He has broken her limbs too.

411
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,416
You're our madam.

412
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:24,625
We are your responsibility.

413
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:27,125
In spite of you being here,
she's as good as dead.

414
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:28,750
These wounds will heal,

415
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,916
but she'll live with this trauma forever.

416
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:34,125
What can I say, my dear?

417
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:39,291
In our profession,
we often come across such monsters.

418
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:45,000
Just like how soldiers face the risk
of getting shot in the battlefield,

419
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:47,500
we have risks too.

420
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:49,083
Are you serious?

421
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:51,208
Only you guys know it all, is it?

422
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,166
Don't you worry, my dear.

423
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,833
I've prayed for your well-being
and donated to the poor.

424
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,125
Here, eat this.

425
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:02,583
If you had gone to the police
instead of putting up an act,

426
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:04,166
the monster would've been arrested.

427
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,875
If I had gone to the police,
they'd have arrested all of us.

428
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,166
So what?

429
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,166
The scoundrel would be punished too!

430
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,250
-What good has come from sitting here--
-Talk softly!

431
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:15,958
-This is a hospital!
-Heard?

432
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:17,000
Heard what?

433
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:20,166
Is setting a price on us
your only responsibility?

434
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,666
I will set a price.

435
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,875
Not once, but every bloody time!

436
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:27,250
I've paid through
the nose to buy you girls.

437
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:29,791
Your family sold you off.

438
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:31,791
I am the one who raised you.

439
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:35,083
And this is how you repay me?

440
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:39,916
My bad luck...

441
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,375
I've done so much for you girls,

442
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,208
yet I get no respect.

443
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:49,708
Nobody cares.

444
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:59,958
These people are treating
the hospital like a brothel.

445
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:04,541
Smoking, cussing, yelling all the time...

446
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:08,625
This dump is the right place for them.

447
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:11,166
I'll come at 8 o'clock
to change the dressing.

448
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:19,625
Shaukat Abbas Khan, that <i>Pathan</i>,

449
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,833
with four murder and three rape cases.

450
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:25,833
-He is Rahim Lala's man.
-Lala is the king of Bombay.

451
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,166
Even the cops here fear him.

452
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:30,458
They say he's a man of principles.

453
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:31,875
He is genuine.

454
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:34,666
I also heard that he's quite a looker.

455
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,416
Now that you know his name, are you happy?

456
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:40,125
Want a drag?

457
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,291
Mr. Rahim.

458
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:32,791
Mr. Rahim.

459
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,875
I want to talk to you.

460
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,083
Hey, you!

461
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm here to seek justice.

462
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:54,333
Take her upstairs.

463
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,291
I'll come after my prayers.

464
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:06,291
It'll be done.

465
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:09,416
I've said it once.
No need to repeat.

466
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:11,000
Namaste, sir.

467
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:14,750
-Assalamu alaikum.
-Alaikum assalam.

468
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,125
Tell me...

469
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,166
I am Gangu,

470
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,208
from the brothel street.

471
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:33,125
What do you want?

472
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:36,416
I've heard about
your principles and honesty.

473
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,208
That's why I thought of--

474
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:40,250
I have enough people who praise me.

475
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,791
What do you want?

476
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,500
You worship your business,

477
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:46,666
and so do we.

478
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:50,000
What if someone disrespects it?

479
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:54,791
Those traitors will be punished by God!

480
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:57,125
And that is why I'm here.

481
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,375
Shaukat Abbas Khan,

482
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:05,541
he works for you.

483
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:07,875
I have many men who work for me...

484
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,750
and against me as well.

485
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:13,375
I don't know them all by name.

486
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:16,000
He used to work at our warehouse
in Antop Hill.

487
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,791
He's been missing for a while.

488
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,416
He has wronged me.

489
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:22,000
I've suffered great loss.

490
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:23,958
You expect him
to settle scores for whores?

491
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:25,666
Not to settle our scores,

492
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,458
but to give me justice.

493
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:32,500
<i>Salaam alaikum, sir.</i>

494
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:37,291
<i>Hello, sir... Hello?</i>

495
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:43,916
It wouldn't hurt as much
if this was just another blow.

496
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:46,041
But this has affected my business.

497
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:50,583
And I'm sure you know
what a loss in my business means.

498
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:58,333
Tell Bilaal to stand guard
outside her brothel.

499
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:03,291
If Shaukat returns, inform Bilaal.

500
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:06,000
I'll take care of the rest.

501
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:08,208
Liyaqat, drop her home,

502
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:10,958
-and give her money for treatment--
-No, sir!

503
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:14,291
It's not about money.

504
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,958
Accept it as a gift from your brother.

505
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:21,000
Go.

506
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:37,583
Come on...

507
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,250
Come on!

508
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:49,541
Hey, handsome, come up.

509
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:53,916
-Come on!
-Bilaal, my love, why so upset?

510
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:58,291
Ever since Lala sent Bilaal here,
the girls have been lusting over him.

511
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:01,583
Leave him alone.
Come inside.

512
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:04,208
Gangu...

513
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:07,208
These girls have fallen for him.

514
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:11,166
Why do it for free when you can get paid?

515
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:16,833
Gangu.

516
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:18,958
-Hmm?
-The <i>Pathan</i> is here.

517
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:29,583
-What do you want to do?
-What do you mean?

518
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:31,208
You are our madam.

519
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:33,291
Ask that monster to leave.

520
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:37,375
After everything that he did, you think
we'll send Gangu back to him? Never!

521
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:39,416
And send her to the hospital again?

522
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,458
Aunt Sheela...

523
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:42,625
Ask for four times the price.

524
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:45,958
-He's ready to pay.
-See...

525
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:49,875
You never miss an opportunity
to make money.

526
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:53,291
Go. I'll be there.

527
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,333
Come fast.

528
00:38:56,791 --> 00:38:58,291
Have you lost your mind?

529
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:01,041
-The witch is after money. Risking your--
-Kamli.

530
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,750
Inform Lala.

531
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:04,333
-But Gangu--
-Go, Kamli.

532
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:07,458
Bilaal?

533
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:09,041
Where did he go?

534
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:11,500
Fool, you scared him away!
Let's go.

535
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:14,208
-He's probably at the tea stall.
-Bilaal!

536
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:17,208
Banwari! What are you staring at!
Go call him!

537
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:18,750
Bilaal!

538
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,875
Bilaal!

539
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:30,083
Bilaal, listen!

540
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:31,250
Go and call Lala.

541
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:33,166
The <i>Pathan</i> is here.
Hurry up.

542
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:38,208
Gangu, Bilaal has gone to bring Lala.

543
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:39,250
Gangu, wait...

544
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:41,000
listen to me.

545
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:49,583
What are you girls staring at?

546
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:53,250
Come on, get to work.

547
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:54,833
Go!

548
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,166
Oh!

549
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:04,083
All the scars I gave you are gone.

550
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:06,166
I'll give you some more this time.

551
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,458
It'll be fun.

552
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:10,083
Beating up a woman?

553
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:11,708
You're not a man.

554
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:33,250
Where is he?
Where is Shaukat?

555
00:40:35,791 --> 00:40:36,750
Shaukat!

556
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,875
Open the door!

557
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,875
Open the door, scumbag!

558
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:56,375
Come out, Shaukat.

559
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:58,291
Open the damn door...

560
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:00,750
What's wrong?

561
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,208
Come on.
You pervert!

562
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:03,291
What's the matter?

563
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:06,375
Leave me!
Where are you taking me?

564
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,250
Where are you taking me!

565
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:11,166
Come, you moron!

566
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:20,666
Rahim Lala, let me go...

567
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,333
Forgive me, please.

568
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:06,041
Give me my money.

569
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:12,083
Give me my rightfully earned money
right now!

570
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:17,666
Motherfucker!

571
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:36,333
Take it easy.

572
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:40,125
You're bedridden so soon, Sheela?

573
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:43,375
When did you guys ever
let me leave my bed?

574
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:47,458
I hope you'll make me meet Gangu today.

575
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:50,625
Ever since Lala called her his sister,

576
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:52,083
she does as she pleases.

577
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:54,916
She is behaving like the new madam here.

578
00:42:55,583 --> 00:42:57,458
I think my time is up.

579
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,375
Time up? Don't be silly.

580
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:04,375
Called for me?

581
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,375
Govind is here for you.

582
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:08,833
I don't feel like it today.

583
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:11,083
What do you mean?

584
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:14,916
It means, I'm running a fever.
Check it if you don't believe me.

585
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:18,791
Yes, yes, you do have a fever.

586
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:20,291
Go get some rest, dear.

587
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:21,708
-Go.
-Hmm.

588
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,250
I'll wait for it to go down...

589
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:25,208
your fever.

590
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:31,750
<i>All plans have backfired!</i>

591
00:43:33,916 --> 00:43:40,000
-Sheela, you need rest.
-Yes...

592
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:42,458
-Should I give you a massage?
-Oh, yes.

593
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:06,375
Gangu!

594
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,166
Gangu!

595
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:12,708
Why are you screaming
so early in the morning?

596
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:14,166
Aunt Sheela...

597
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:15,583
Come quickly.

598
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:31,166
Thinking of money
until her very last breath.

599
00:44:31,791 --> 00:44:34,250
We've earned this.
Distribute it among yourselves.

600
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:46,291
Kamli, take her away

601
00:44:46,666 --> 00:44:47,833
right now.

602
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:51,625
And tell her henchmen
not to come to work from tomorrow.

603
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:54,291
We will take care of ourselves now.

604
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,000
-Gangu!
-Hmm.

605
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:08,208
Shinde.

606
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,291
The scoundrel is here.

607
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,583
It's a tricky situation.
Can you manage?

608
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:15,083
Don't worry, I will.

609
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:17,666
Namaste, madam.

610
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:19,708
-Sit...
-Sorry?

611
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:21,541
She wants you to sit.

612
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:22,708
Oh...

613
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:25,916
No, it's okay.

614
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:29,875
This room feels so empty
without Ms. Sheela.

615
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:33,666
Shinde, we didn't call you here to mourn.

616
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:36,625
Your men have been asking
for a lot of bribe.

617
00:45:36,708 --> 00:45:40,458
And you guys end up
taking 40 percent of our earnings!

618
00:45:40,541 --> 00:45:41,791
It's getting difficult.

619
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:43,791
There's a new officer
at the police station.

620
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:46,125
He is very stubborn
and does as he pleases.

621
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:48,958
Great, you keep asking for bribes

622
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:51,208
and our landlord has increased the rent.

623
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:54,500
We've lost our madam
and you want to bring us to the streets.

624
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:57,375
No, the neighborhood
has called for a committee meeting.

625
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:59,625
These government issues take time...

626
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,166
-It will be done.
-Kamli?

627
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:02,750
When will Mr. Rahim come?

628
00:46:02,916 --> 00:46:04,583
Why disturb him?

629
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:07,750
I'll sort it out.
Please be patient.

630
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:12,500
After all...
you are the new madam now.

631
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:17,500
I pray that Ms. Sheela's
gentle soul goes to heaven.

632
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:19,750
Or hell.

633
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:23,500
Get the job done in 15 days, Shinde.

634
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:24,666
I will...

635
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:36,250
Well done, what a performance!
You brought a cop to his knees today!

636
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:38,833
This neighborhood too
will fall on its knees.

637
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:45,083
"There are a thousand yearnings

638
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,708
that afflict my heart..."

639
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:48,916
Gangu!

640
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:50,958
We want to talk to you.

641
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:54,000
What is it?
Everyone together in my room?

642
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,750
Going on a strike?

643
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:57,041
No.

644
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:00,291
We have a gift for you.

645
00:47:01,041 --> 00:47:02,250
Gift? For what?

646
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:06,333
You're the only person in Kamathipura
who understands our plight,

647
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:08,791
thinks of our welfare,
fights for our rights.

648
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:11,375
And only a good madam
would do all this.

649
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:14,750
You are making me
a "madam" at 27, huh?

650
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,750
If I wear a white sari in my youth,

651
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:19,333
all my clients will run away.

652
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:20,625
Gangu,

653
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:24,000
you don't need to satisfy any client now.

654
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:25,458
Just look after us.

655
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:27,166
When you wear this white sari,

656
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:28,916
you'll look like a politician!

657
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,583
Right! Enough of all
this politician, election

658
00:47:32,666 --> 00:47:33,666
and praising.

659
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,708
Get to work now.

660
00:47:34,791 --> 00:47:37,333
-But will you be our madam?
-Darling...

661
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:39,375
I'll think about it.

662
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:42,583
If you refuse...

663
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:44,791
what will happen to us?

664
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:49,250
-Please say yes, Gangu.
-Rama...

665
00:47:51,541 --> 00:47:52,666
Come on...

666
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:54,583
Do it, Gangu.

667
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,041
You are our madam now...

668
00:48:20,416 --> 00:48:22,416
<i>From Ganga, I became Gangu,</i>

669
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:25,000
<i>then from Gangu I became Gangubai.</i>

670
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:27,250
<i>The madam.</i>

671
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:30,458
If you want,

672
00:48:30,791 --> 00:48:33,166
you too can become
Madhubai from Madhu, dear.

673
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:37,750
I'm done here.
I have other things to take care of.

674
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,416
Look, darling,

675
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,166
I didn't have any option but to fight,

676
00:48:42,625 --> 00:48:44,666
but you do.

677
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:47,000
If you choose this,

678
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:48,708
you live here.

679
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:51,416
And if you choose this,

680
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:53,125
you die.

681
00:48:54,083 --> 00:48:55,166
It is poison.

682
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,875
You decide now.

683
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,166
Have you explained it to her?

684
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,583
I have.
Now you need to understand.

685
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:27,791
This girl will go back home.

686
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:32,083
I didn't call you here
to set my girl free.

687
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:34,083
She'd rather die than comply.

688
00:49:34,375 --> 00:49:36,541
If she dies, you'll be in trouble.

689
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:37,875
I don't care.

690
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,250
If she doesn't spread her legs,
she'll beg.

691
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:41,916
But she will stay here.

692
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:44,291
I have paid Rs. 1,000 for her.

693
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:47,458
Come and take ten thousand
from me tomorrow.

694
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:58,833
Let's go, darling.

695
00:50:00,916 --> 00:50:02,708
Showing off your money!

696
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,916
To me? Rashmibai?

697
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,708
With the elections around the corner,
she thinks she's a minister already!

698
00:50:08,791 --> 00:50:11,166
No matter how pristine your clothes are,

699
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:14,375
you'll always be a prostitute!

700
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:19,000
Are you behaving like a saint
now that the elections are here?

701
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:21,875
Wait and watch what happens
when you lose--

702
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:56,041
Rehman...

703
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:57,416
Yes, madam.

704
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,333
I've managed to free her
after a lot of difficulty.

705
00:51:00,416 --> 00:51:04,750
Take the bus tonight and ensure
that she reaches her home safely.

706
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:08,916
And you'll keep wasting
your money freeing these girls?

707
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:11,041
I hope you know what you're doing.

708
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:12,333
Politics...

709
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:13,833
you won't understand.

710
00:51:14,791 --> 00:51:15,666
Take her and go.

711
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:35,375
So, Rajjo...

712
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:37,083
did you try the <i>laddus</i> I sent?

713
00:51:37,166 --> 00:51:38,416
What <i>laddus</i>, Gangubai?

714
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:41,166
Those were polished off by the children!

715
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:45,125
-We didn't get any.
-I'll send some more tomorrow.

716
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:48,916
You can pack some
for Najma to take to school.

717
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:52,291
What's the point in sending her to school?
She'll have to work in the brothel anyway.

718
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:53,583
What nonsense!

719
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:54,708
Gangubai!

720
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:57,208
-I've brought saris for you.
-Two minutes.

721
00:51:57,666 --> 00:51:59,875
Listen, this is not right, Rajjo.

722
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,166
-Come and meet me tomorrow.
-Okay, Gangubai.

723
00:52:05,583 --> 00:52:09,083
By the way, the blouse you
tailored last time didn't fit well.

724
00:52:09,208 --> 00:52:12,458
Actually, my eyesight is getting weak.

725
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:16,208
Along with the saris,
I will take your measurement again today.

726
00:52:19,875 --> 00:52:21,083
Oh, wow...

727
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:25,416
I had just asked for saris, but
you've brought along "youth" as well.

728
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:29,250
He is my nephew.

729
00:52:30,041 --> 00:52:32,500
He has come from Calcutta
to learn the business.

730
00:52:32,791 --> 00:52:34,541
He'll take care of my work from now on.

731
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:36,666
What's your name again?

732
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:38,291
Afshan.

733
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:39,458
That's all?

734
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:41,333
No... Badr Razaq.

735
00:52:41,416 --> 00:52:42,708
Afshan Badr Razaq.

736
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:47,166
-Who will take the measurements?
-Go, take the measurements.

737
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,500
I'll write them down.

738
00:52:55,458 --> 00:52:57,250
Shoulders, 15 inches.

739
00:52:59,916 --> 00:53:01,000
Sleeves, 6 inches.

740
00:53:05,791 --> 00:53:06,833
Neck, 7 inches.

741
00:53:09,166 --> 00:53:10,458
Neck, 8 inches.

742
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:18,250
Why are you standing so far?
Are you measuring a tree?

743
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:23,041
34... chest.

744
00:53:24,291 --> 00:53:25,583
134!

745
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:29,083
Your heartbeat.

746
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,625
Show me the saris.

747
00:53:40,958 --> 00:53:43,125
Tell me.
Which one should I buy?

748
00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:45,833
Choose any, they're all white.

749
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:47,625
Which white should I choose?

750
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,791
As white as the moon?

751
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:52,875
Or as white as the clouds?

752
00:53:56,916 --> 00:53:58,833
As white as paper?

753
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:01,125
Or as white as a white rose?

754
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:07,333
As white as snow,
or as white as salt?

755
00:54:08,416 --> 00:54:10,291
As white as milk,

756
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:12,708
or as white as seashells?

757
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,916
As white as the streams,

758
00:54:16,958 --> 00:54:18,583
or as white as sand?

759
00:54:20,666 --> 00:54:21,750
Or as white as smoke?

760
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:26,500
As white as a swan.

761
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:12,916
<i>When my lover visits me at sunset</i>

762
00:56:13,416 --> 00:56:19,083
<i>I shine as bright as the moon</i>

763
00:56:19,166 --> 00:56:24,666
<i>When my lover visits me at sunset</i>

764
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:31,291
<i>I shine as bright as the moon</i>

765
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:37,166
<i>I embrace and rejoice</i>

766
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:43,875
<i>In every slur cast upon me</i>

767
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,333
<i>When my lover visits me at sunset</i>

768
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:55,833
<i>I shine as bright as the moon</i>

769
00:56:56,291 --> 00:57:01,791
<i>When my lover visits me at sunset</i>

770
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:08,458
<i>I shine as bright as the moon</i>

771
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:33,625
<i>Every corner of my house</i>

772
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:39,166
<i>Has become my confidante</i>

773
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:46,041
<i>They ask myriad of questions</i>

774
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:51,625
<i>How many do I answer?</i>

775
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:58,291
<i>Countless emotions in my heart</i>

776
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:03,250
<i>Came alive</i>

777
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:09,500
<i>When my lover visited me at sunset</i>

778
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:16,041
<i>I shine as bright as the moon</i>

779
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:21,791
<i>When my lover visited me at sunset</i>

780
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:28,041
<i>I shine as bright as the moon</i>

781
00:58:53,750 --> 00:59:00,041
<i>I don't get the time to look at myself</i>

782
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:06,708
<i>Everything pales</i>

783
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:11,458
<i>In the light of his love</i>

784
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,916
<i>I don't get the time to look at myself</i>

785
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:24,375
<i>Everything pales in the light of his love</i>

786
00:59:24,458 --> 00:59:29,458
<i>I beam with pride</i>

787
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:35,708
<i>Despite the insults cast upon me</i>

788
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:42,000
<i>When my lover visits me at sunset</i>

789
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:48,291
<i>I shine as bright as the moon</i>

790
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:54,208
<i>I embrace and rejoice</i>

791
00:59:54,791 --> 01:00:00,666
<i>In every slur cast upon me</i>

792
01:00:17,916 --> 01:00:20,083
All finances go haywire
with these late bribes.

793
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:22,458
Ma'am, I need to talk to you.
Is this a good time?

794
01:00:22,541 --> 01:00:23,583
Go on.

795
01:00:23,666 --> 01:00:27,291
I dropped that girl, Madhu, back home.
Her family gave a lot of blessings.

796
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:31,083
I didn't understand at first,
but what you did was very noble.

797
01:00:31,166 --> 01:00:32,083
Anything else?

798
01:00:32,166 --> 01:00:35,833
Madam, these are last week's collections
from Lane 7 to Lane 11.

799
01:00:35,958 --> 01:00:37,041
Rs. 11,000.

800
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:38,375
Why such a small sum?

801
01:00:38,875 --> 01:00:41,625
Everyone gets religious
this time of the year.

802
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:42,791
Badri...

803
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:46,291
The election for the President
of Kamathipura is coming up.

804
01:00:46,541 --> 01:00:48,958
If we don't have money, how do we win?

805
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:51,000
That too against Razia?

806
01:00:51,083 --> 01:00:55,250
Madam, Razia has been the President
of Kamathipura for the last two years.

807
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:56,750
You can't defeat her.

808
01:00:56,833 --> 01:00:59,250
-She has a strong hold over this place.
-So?

809
01:01:01,708 --> 01:01:02,833
I'll tell you what.

810
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:05,500
Spread the news

811
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:09,291
that Gangubai has rescued
a 15-year-old innocent girl

812
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:11,291
and sent her back home.

813
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,333
It's time to bring Razia down.

814
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:17,291
Now leave.

815
01:01:17,375 --> 01:01:18,916
I've kept the money, madam.

816
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:23,458
-Hey, Birju!
-Yes, madam?

817
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:24,583
Count the money.

818
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:26,541
It should be 11,000.

819
01:01:28,666 --> 01:01:32,500
Victory to Raziabai!

820
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:37,041
-Who is our dear sister?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!

821
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:41,291
-Who is our dear sister?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!

822
01:01:41,416 --> 01:01:45,666
-Who is the queen of Kamathipura?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!

823
01:01:45,875 --> 01:01:50,041
-Who is the queen of Kamathipura?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!

824
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:54,250
-Who is our dear sister?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!

825
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:58,791
Victory to Raziabai!

826
01:01:58,875 --> 01:02:03,125
-Who is our dear sister?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!

827
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:07,750
{\an8}-Who is the queen of Kamathipura?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!

828
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:12,041
{\an8}Victory to Raziabai!

829
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:16,625
-Who is our dear sister?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!

830
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:32,916
May God bless you with good health
and good fortune.

831
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:37,916
Lala,

832
01:02:38,541 --> 01:02:43,291
your grand <i>Eid</i> celebration here
reminds me of Kabul.

833
01:02:43,541 --> 01:02:44,833
It's God's grace.

834
01:02:44,916 --> 01:02:46,583
Sir, Gangubai.

835
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:52,958
Happy <i>Eid</i>, Gangu.

836
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:54,375
Happy <i>Eid</i>, sir.

837
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:56,416
Why are you sitting alone here?

838
01:02:56,583 --> 01:03:00,625
Well, I feel smaller
when I'm around these respectable people.

839
01:03:01,416 --> 01:03:03,583
I have made <i>sevaiya</i> for you.

840
01:03:03,666 --> 01:03:05,708
-You made this?
-Yes, for the first time.

841
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:08,666
Then I have to eat it. Sit.

842
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,666
-Sit down.
-Yes.

843
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:16,416
You look worried.

844
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:20,208
Well, the neighborhood elections
are around the corner.

845
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:23,416
If I win, I'll become
the new President of Kamathipura.

846
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,083
But Razia is my opponent.

847
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:28,500
You're no less than Razia Sultan!
Have faith.

848
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:30,708
You'll win.

849
01:03:31,125 --> 01:03:33,541
Sure, but faith doesn't
help win elections,

850
01:03:33,625 --> 01:03:34,916
money does.

851
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:37,083
How much?

852
01:03:39,541 --> 01:03:41,041
Think of it as a loan.

853
01:03:43,125 --> 01:03:44,375
May I ask for something else?

854
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:46,041
Yes.

855
01:03:46,666 --> 01:03:50,375
What if I handle your alcohol business
in Kamathipura?

856
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:56,791
Sir, customers consume alcohol
and come to Kamathipura.

857
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:59,500
What if they got the alcohol
at the brothel itself?

858
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:01,916
"Buy alcohol if you want a woman!"

859
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
We can earn some
extra money as well.

860
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:08,208
And make my sister sell alcohol?

861
01:04:09,583 --> 01:04:12,750
This <i>Pathan</i> has given up his land,
not his values!

862
01:04:14,291 --> 01:04:17,041
Next time, add some more almonds
to the <i>sevaiya</i>.

863
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,250
Sir, I know this is wrong,

864
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:24,083
but my intentions are good.

865
01:04:25,916 --> 01:04:29,500
It's not about values,
it's about the lives of those women.

866
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:32,500
And I have to win this election for them.

867
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:37,666
If I win, I can fight for them and try
to change their lives for the better.

868
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:41,833
Or else, Razia will continue
to make our lives hell.

869
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:44,625
The rest is up to you.

870
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:55,041
I surrender my principles
before your good intentions.

871
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:58,166
From today, we're business partners.

872
01:04:58,916 --> 01:05:02,958
Twenty percent of the profits
from the sales in Kamathipura is yours.

873
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:07,250
You've done a favor not only to Gangu,

874
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:10,625
but to the 4,000 women of Kamathipura.

875
01:05:14,083 --> 01:05:16,041
Bow down only before God.

876
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:30,750
Gangu.

877
01:05:35,666 --> 01:05:37,208
New business calls for a new car.

878
01:05:37,291 --> 01:05:38,625
But, sir--

879
01:05:38,708 --> 01:05:39,875
Your gift for <i>Eid</i>.

880
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,666
Also, get your business cards printed.

881
01:05:44,666 --> 01:05:47,125
"Gangubai, Mafia Queen."

882
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:03,375
Gangubai?

883
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:04,666
Who is it?

884
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:07,375
-It's me...
-Who?

885
01:06:07,708 --> 01:06:09,958
-Afshan!
-Mr. Razaq.

886
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:11,250
Yes.

887
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:12,333
Come inside.

888
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:14,458
Inside?

889
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:15,666
Yeah.

890
01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:22,250
What brings you here?

891
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:24,250
I've...

892
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:26,875
got your blouse, it's ready.

893
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:29,083
Give it.

894
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:32,125
You said two days,
you've brought it after a week.

895
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:40,583
If it doesn't fit me well,
just you wait and watch!

896
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:43,833
Why are you standing? Sit.

897
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:56,458
What happened?

898
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:58,541
I'm bathing and you're getting wet!

899
01:06:58,625 --> 01:07:00,625
No, looking at you...

900
01:07:02,458 --> 01:07:04,333
You are so beautiful...

901
01:07:07,708 --> 01:07:09,875
Did I say something wrong?

902
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,041
You are smiling?

903
01:07:13,458 --> 01:07:15,666
It's called being coy, Mr. Razaq.

904
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:19,166
I've seen many men come and go,

905
01:07:19,625 --> 01:07:22,166
this is the first time
I'm meeting a real man.

906
01:07:27,166 --> 01:07:28,416
Want something to eat?

907
01:07:29,416 --> 01:07:30,458
No.

908
01:07:31,291 --> 01:07:32,750
Want something to drink?

909
01:07:34,875 --> 01:07:36,125
Want to bathe with me?

910
01:07:38,583 --> 01:07:40,458
Do you have anything else to say but "no"?

911
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:43,000
Gangubai, I love you very much.

912
01:07:49,208 --> 01:07:50,291
I love you too.

913
01:07:53,625 --> 01:07:56,291
I feel like hugging you.

914
01:07:59,083 --> 01:08:00,041
Me too.

915
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:14,625
This new car, Gangu--

916
01:09:15,541 --> 01:09:16,791
Gangubai...

917
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:18,541
This one is much better,

918
01:09:18,666 --> 01:09:20,166
and more expensive.

919
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,500
I never thought
I'd be sitting in such a car.

920
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,666
But I did.

921
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:29,750
I don't want you to drink.

922
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,625
Really?

923
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:33,583
What do you want then?

924
01:09:34,166 --> 01:09:35,750
I want to marry you.

925
01:09:41,625 --> 01:09:42,708
Really, I do.

926
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,041
This big car has fueled
some big dreams, huh?

927
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:51,916
-You got upset, my love?
-No, it's okay.

928
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,750
Fine, I'm not drinking. Happy?

929
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:57,250
Mr. Razaq...

930
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:23,791
<i>My love... my love...</i>

931
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:25,791
<i>My love...</i>

932
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:28,625
<i>My love... my love...</i>

933
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:30,333
<i>My love...</i>

934
01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:33,666
<i>The night is intoxicating</i>

935
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:35,833
<i>Everything seems heady</i>

936
01:10:35,958 --> 01:10:39,875
<i>Come, let us get drunk</i>

937
01:10:40,541 --> 01:10:42,750
<i>Together we are magic</i>

938
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:45,041
<i>Under these drunken showers</i>

939
01:10:45,166 --> 01:10:49,416
<i>Come, let us get drunk</i>

940
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:51,708
<i>My love... my love...</i>

941
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:53,833
<i>My love...</i>

942
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:56,333
<i>My love... my love...</i>

943
01:10:56,416 --> 01:10:58,333
<i>My love...</i>

944
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:33,250
<i>Nothing is as intoxicating as my eyes</i>

945
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:40,291
<i>Nothing is as intoxicating as my eyes</i>

946
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:44,791
<i>Everyone wishes to drown in them</i>

947
01:11:44,875 --> 01:11:51,416
<i>It is for you that I reject everyone else</i>

948
01:12:01,041 --> 01:12:03,208
<i>My love... my love...</i>

949
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:05,166
<i>My love...</i>

950
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:07,750
<i>My love... my love...</i>

951
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:09,958
<i>My love...</i>

952
01:12:34,291 --> 01:12:37,666
<i>Stay awake!</i>

953
01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:42,750
You should go home now.

954
01:12:43,541 --> 01:12:45,750
Your intentions don't seem right.

955
01:12:46,875 --> 01:12:51,166
-I was just... your shoes.
-Hmm, good job!

956
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,500
Go on, drop him home.

957
01:12:56,041 --> 01:12:57,541
Birju...

958
01:12:57,916 --> 01:12:59,750
Open the door!

959
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:01,708
Gangubai!

960
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:03,375
I told you to go home...

961
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:07,041
Raziabai has called for you. Come to
the office at 6 o'clock tomorrow.

962
01:13:07,125 --> 01:13:09,416
Tell Razia that I don't have time!

963
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,541
Hey, you have to come.

964
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:13,916
Raziabai won't take no for an answer.

965
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:15,875
What the...

966
01:13:17,541 --> 01:13:19,375
Just hearing Razia's name

967
01:13:20,333 --> 01:13:21,708
makes me want to puke.

968
01:13:21,791 --> 01:13:23,166
You stay in your limits!

969
01:13:28,041 --> 01:13:29,250
How dare you...

970
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:32,125
-What are you doing?
-Limits, huh?

971
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:35,625
-If Raziabai finds out--
-You dare talk about limits! Get lost!

972
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:40,375
How dare you threaten Gangubai
in her house!

973
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:44,583
Get lost, you piece of shit.
Bloody scumbag!

974
01:13:44,875 --> 01:13:47,541
Telling Gangubai to stay in limits!

975
01:13:48,166 --> 01:13:49,875
Tell Razia...

976
01:13:50,041 --> 01:13:52,083
Gangubai is fearless!

977
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:54,666
Talking about bloody limits...

978
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,500
Threatening Gangubai?

979
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:59,375
Who are you threatening
about the elections?

980
01:14:01,875 --> 01:14:06,041
Tell Razia...
Gangubai is not scared.

981
01:14:08,666 --> 01:14:10,333
Go. Tell her.

982
01:14:14,458 --> 01:14:15,625
Press harder.

983
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:18,458
Things still seem upside down.

984
01:14:18,583 --> 01:14:20,916
Are you still hungover, Gangu?

985
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:22,791
-No.
-Try some steam.

986
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,625
<i>My love... my love...</i>

987
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:29,541
Don't drink so much,
it's not good for health.

988
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:30,916
Police! Police! Police!

989
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,875
-The police are here for a raid.
-Come on!

990
01:14:34,875 --> 01:14:37,375
-Birju, you continue...
-Yes, madam.

991
01:14:37,458 --> 01:14:40,416
-Check over there!
-Sir...

992
01:14:43,708 --> 01:14:45,041
Why are you hitting me?

993
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,750
Search every corner!

994
01:14:48,875 --> 01:14:51,000
I'll shut this place down today.

995
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:52,583
-Shinde.
-Yes, sir.

996
01:14:52,666 --> 01:14:56,333
The madam is making a lot of money
by selling alcohol.

997
01:14:56,541 --> 01:14:58,750
She bought an imported car as well.

998
01:14:58,875 --> 01:15:00,458
It's Prohibition time.

999
01:15:00,541 --> 01:15:03,083
There's a risk of the madam
going behind bars.

1000
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:04,958
And listen carefully.

1001
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:09,666
Gangubai, if I find a single bottle,
you will be in jail for five years.

1002
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:11,541
That too, in Nasik jail.

1003
01:15:11,625 --> 01:15:15,333
Heard you're quite found of <i>Pathans</i>.
You'll find a lot of them there.

1004
01:15:15,875 --> 01:15:17,500
-Birju.
-Yes, madam.

1005
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Do you think Gangubai eats shit?

1006
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,208
Hmm?

1007
01:15:24,291 --> 01:15:27,791
With elections around the corner
and these hungry dogs running around,

1008
01:15:27,875 --> 01:15:31,041
will Gangu make the mistake
of leaving food out in the open?

1009
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:43,208
Now shove this in your mouth.

1010
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:45,500
Maybe it will clean the filth in there.

1011
01:15:48,541 --> 01:15:49,500
Let's go!

1012
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:50,666
The raid's over.

1013
01:15:51,916 --> 01:15:54,250
-Come on, let's leave!
-Let's go.

1014
01:15:54,916 --> 01:15:56,625
Leave!

1015
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:02,458
What is it?

1016
01:16:02,541 --> 01:16:05,625
Gangubai, Raziabai orchestrated all this.

1017
01:16:05,708 --> 01:16:07,625
Why don't you go meet her once?

1018
01:16:07,708 --> 01:16:09,791
All your problems will come to an end.

1019
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:12,416
Tell Razia I'm very busy.

1020
01:16:12,666 --> 01:16:14,583
I'll meet her on election day.

1021
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,625
-Another thing, Shinde.
-Yes?

1022
01:16:16,708 --> 01:16:18,250
You were a cop.

1023
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:20,333
When did you become a postman?

1024
01:16:21,708 --> 01:16:23,083
Birju!

1025
01:16:32,916 --> 01:16:33,916
What do you have?

1026
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,791
-<i>Bheja fry.</i>
-Good choice! This is perfect for her.

1027
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:39,166
-Madam!
-Hmm?

1028
01:16:39,583 --> 01:16:41,958
Look, Raziabai is here.

1029
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:45,375
Victory to Raziabai!
Victory to Raziabai!

1030
01:16:45,458 --> 01:16:49,583
-Who is the queen of Kamathipura?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!

1031
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:57,916
You have the time to savor
<i>nalli nihari</i>,

1032
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:02,833
but not to meet Razia?

1033
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:07,083
My girls informed me
that the cops visited you.

1034
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:11,583
They threatened to put you
in jail for five years.

1035
01:17:13,958 --> 01:17:16,208
Thought I'd come here
and meet you one last time

1036
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:21,583
and try to talk some sense into you.

1037
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,500
Birju!

1038
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:27,916
Get a plate for Raziabai.

1039
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,625
Why would I need a plate,

1040
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:49,458
when snatching my share
is so much more fun!

1041
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:55,416
You like to have fun, right?

1042
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,125
Tomorrow I will not only
barge into your house,

1043
01:18:02,458 --> 01:18:04,375
but bury you right there!

1044
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:07,875
You see these hands?

1045
01:18:08,416 --> 01:18:11,666
When I clap with these hands,

1046
01:18:12,166 --> 01:18:16,166
I can crush my enemy's skull between them.

1047
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:19,250
Beneath every stone in my area,

1048
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:25,875
I've buried many like you
who tried to cross me.

1049
01:18:28,958 --> 01:18:30,750
And you're showing me this attitude?

1050
01:18:31,166 --> 01:18:33,500
Why would I show you
any attitude, Raziabai?

1051
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:37,750
I will show you stars in daylight.

1052
01:18:54,708 --> 01:18:58,916
It'll take me only so much time
to show you your worth,

1053
01:18:59,291 --> 01:19:01,958
and it will be that much more fun!

1054
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,625
Forget about this election.

1055
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:09,916
Kamathipura belonged to Raziabai.

1056
01:19:10,916 --> 01:19:15,041
Kamathipura will
always belong to Raziabai!

1057
01:19:18,916 --> 01:19:21,291
Make sure you come tomorrow at nine,

1058
01:19:22,416 --> 01:19:24,916
for my speech in the neighborhood.

1059
01:19:36,916 --> 01:19:39,250
Victory to Raziabai!

1060
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,916
Victory to Raziabai!

1061
01:19:42,041 --> 01:19:47,250
-Who is our dear sister?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!

1062
01:19:47,333 --> 01:19:52,750
-Who is our dear sister?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!

1063
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:58,291
-How do you do this?
-That hawker was so irritating.

1064
01:19:58,583 --> 01:20:01,416
He just refused to reduce the price.

1065
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:03,291
Yeah, he was...

1066
01:20:05,708 --> 01:20:08,458
Why are you looking
at this idiot's face? Let's go.

1067
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:14,416
Yesterday, Razia came here
and publicly humiliated me.

1068
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,416
I will not let her win, Mr. Rahim.

1069
01:20:17,666 --> 01:20:22,166
I will earn respect not just for myself,
but for all the women in Kamathipura.

1070
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:23,958
-Gangubai--
-Hush.

1071
01:20:24,125 --> 01:20:26,750
By the way, Khan was here for a raid...

1072
01:20:27,333 --> 01:20:29,333
The loser fled, tail between his legs.

1073
01:20:30,083 --> 01:20:31,958
He didn't find a drop of alcohol.

1074
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,250
I took care of everything, Mr. Rahim.

1075
01:20:35,625 --> 01:20:38,083
I'm your sister, you've taught me well.

1076
01:20:39,041 --> 01:20:43,125
Razia's cronies have been
threatening me since morning.

1077
01:20:43,458 --> 01:20:46,125
She left in a fit,
who knows what she'll do next.

1078
01:20:46,666 --> 01:20:48,541
You'll have to handle this.

1079
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:51,416
Send some of your men over,
for our safety.

1080
01:20:51,958 --> 01:20:55,250
If you continue to support us like this,

1081
01:20:55,375 --> 01:20:56,666
this election is ours.

1082
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:58,250
Yes, bye.

1083
01:20:58,333 --> 01:20:59,958
Thank you.

1084
01:21:03,416 --> 01:21:05,083
I have to admit, Mr. Govind,

1085
01:21:05,916 --> 01:21:09,291
by getting these reels,
you've paved the way for our victory.

1086
01:21:09,791 --> 01:21:11,083
-Look, Badri...
-Yes.

1087
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:13,791
He's got us these reels
directly from the theater.

1088
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:17,791
Actually, madam, there's one reel missing.

1089
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:19,500
Don't worry.

1090
01:21:20,291 --> 01:21:23,500
Only two reels are enough
for me to finish Razia!

1091
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:27,750
Hey, Badri. Set up the screen.

1092
01:21:29,041 --> 01:21:30,250
<i>Have a seat.</i>

1093
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,916
<i>I'll make this quick.</i>

1094
01:21:33,333 --> 01:21:35,875
<i>So you need not get up either.</i>

1095
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:39,750
<i>Where's the villain</i>
<i>whom you call your manager?</i>

1096
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:41,125
<i>Where is he!</i>

1097
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:48,833
Gangu, your brilliant move
will crush Raziabai.

1098
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:50,875
All of Kamathipura is here.

1099
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:53,416
Who will go to hear her speech now?

1100
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:57,333
Where is everyone?

1101
01:21:57,416 --> 01:21:59,250
Watching a movie in Gangu's lane.

1102
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:08,500
Will I deliver my speech
to these empty chairs?

1103
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:13,083
Call everyone.

1104
01:22:14,833 --> 01:22:16,125
Get lost!

1105
01:22:44,166 --> 01:22:45,750
What happened, Raziabai?

1106
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:48,625
Weren't you supposed
to deliver a speech?

1107
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:52,458
No one turned up!

1108
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:54,041
No problem.

1109
01:22:54,125 --> 01:22:55,083
I am here.

1110
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:56,750
I'll listen to it,

1111
01:22:56,833 --> 01:22:58,541
and clap as well!

1112
01:22:58,625 --> 01:23:02,000
{\an8}VOTE FOR RAZIABAI

1113
01:23:05,166 --> 01:23:09,375
{\an8}No one can clap as thunderously as I do.

1114
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,875
{\an8}I am neither a man nor woman,

1115
01:23:13,708 --> 01:23:16,416
but more than enough
for the likes of you!

1116
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,625
Sitting on the ground suits you.

1117
01:23:35,583 --> 01:23:37,125
Get used to it,

1118
01:23:38,125 --> 01:23:39,958
because you will be dethroned soon.

1119
01:23:40,041 --> 01:23:41,958
{\an8}Defeating Razia

1120
01:23:42,291 --> 01:23:44,333
{\an8}and hosting a wedding in a brothel,

1121
01:23:45,541 --> 01:23:47,208
{\an8}are dreams...

1122
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:49,833
{\an8}impossible to fulfill!

1123
01:23:52,166 --> 01:23:54,416
{\an8}Now that you've started a war,

1124
01:23:56,125 --> 01:23:57,625
{\an8}then prepare yourself...

1125
01:23:59,583 --> 01:24:00,833
{\an8}for an attack!

1126
01:24:11,125 --> 01:24:12,333
Gangu!

1127
01:24:14,291 --> 01:24:17,541
What's with all this exercise?
You want to be a wrestler?

1128
01:24:18,625 --> 01:24:21,375
How do you like your new poster?

1129
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:23,416
I'm not shining through.

1130
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:24,916
What more do you want?

1131
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:26,500
You're laden with gold.

1132
01:24:26,791 --> 01:24:28,375
You want a golden tooth as well?

1133
01:24:28,791 --> 01:24:30,000
Good idea.

1134
01:24:31,208 --> 01:24:32,458
If I win, I'll get one.

1135
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:33,958
Join me.

1136
01:24:38,583 --> 01:24:41,166
Gangu, don't worry.

1137
01:24:41,458 --> 01:24:43,541
The entire neighborhood supports you.

1138
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:47,458
-That's half the battle won.
-But the other half is still left, Kamli.

1139
01:24:51,083 --> 01:24:53,333
Just one more trump card,

1140
01:24:54,166 --> 01:24:56,250
and that'll be the end of Razia.

1141
01:24:58,291 --> 01:25:03,250
I can't wait to go
and slap your poster on Razia's face!

1142
01:25:04,083 --> 01:25:05,875
All hell will break lose, Gangu.

1143
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:12,666
What happened?

1144
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:31,625
Kamli.

1145
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:34,416
Go and get the keys from Kusum.

1146
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:39,375
I've told you repeatedly

1147
01:25:39,458 --> 01:25:42,458
not to give her opium
and hide her around.

1148
01:25:42,541 --> 01:25:43,833
What else can I do?

1149
01:25:44,833 --> 01:25:46,458
Roshni is 15 now.

1150
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,666
All kinds of men come here every night.

1151
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:51,875
If one of them spots her,

1152
01:25:52,208 --> 01:25:54,583
she'll be devoured, just like us.

1153
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,083
She might get addicted
and her life will be ruined.

1154
01:26:00,166 --> 01:26:01,916
What life?

1155
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:05,666
We have no home, no roof, no husband...

1156
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:10,375
Every night we sell our bodies so that
our children may lead a better life.

1157
01:26:12,708 --> 01:26:14,625
I'm tired of hiding her.

1158
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,208
How long can one keep a bird caged up?

1159
01:26:19,625 --> 01:26:22,208
You can't cage her
like an animal, Kusum.

1160
01:26:23,125 --> 01:26:24,791
She's old enough to marry.

1161
01:26:25,416 --> 01:26:27,708
I'll either get her married or kill her.

1162
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:29,875
I won't let her be a prostitute.

1163
01:26:29,958 --> 01:26:32,500
So you'll have a wedding in Kamathipura?

1164
01:26:33,541 --> 01:26:35,333
No one gets married here, Kusum.

1165
01:26:35,458 --> 01:26:37,875
-Stop dreaming of settling her down.
-Why?

1166
01:26:39,666 --> 01:26:42,958
If Gangu can dream,
then why can't Roshni?

1167
01:26:56,833 --> 01:26:57,958
Get off.

1168
01:27:09,833 --> 01:27:11,625
You have a nice house.

1169
01:27:12,416 --> 01:27:15,500
Why don't you get a daughter-in-law
and make it a home?

1170
01:27:15,666 --> 01:27:16,958
Not yet.

1171
01:27:17,166 --> 01:27:19,666
We can barely make ends meet.

1172
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:22,166
And Afshan has just started working--

1173
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:23,375
Exactly.

1174
01:27:24,083 --> 01:27:29,000
Ms. Salma, I've found him a match
that you won't be able to refuse.

1175
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:32,083
This is Kusum.

1176
01:27:32,375 --> 01:27:36,041
I've brought her daughter, Roshni's
proposal for your son, Afshan.

1177
01:27:39,416 --> 01:27:41,791
A proposal for me?
With whose permission?

1178
01:27:41,875 --> 01:27:44,000
This is ridiculous.

1179
01:27:44,083 --> 01:27:45,416
Kusum!

1180
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:51,166
Around 350 grams of gold,

1181
01:27:51,416 --> 01:27:52,958
fifty thousand rupees in cash...

1182
01:27:53,041 --> 01:27:54,750
and sweets worth Rs. 25.

1183
01:27:55,083 --> 01:27:59,250
If you're still unsure,
have a look at this tray full of gold,

1184
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:01,666
and the whole world will sparkle
in front of you.

1185
01:28:03,291 --> 01:28:07,208
With all this... are you
trying to buy me or sell her?

1186
01:28:09,125 --> 01:28:10,750
Sir, make him understand...

1187
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:15,000
I'm not buying or selling, I'm saving her
from ending up as a prostitute.

1188
01:28:15,166 --> 01:28:17,916
And by marrying her,
you'll do a noble deed, my dear.

1189
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,166
I'm not interested in being noble.
I reject your proposal.

1190
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:23,958
-Actually--
-We're still talking, Ms. Salma.

1191
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,416
Brother, please say something.

1192
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:34,791
Dear, how can a prostitute
be our daughter-in-law?

1193
01:28:34,875 --> 01:28:36,958
That's exactly what I'm trying to say.

1194
01:28:37,666 --> 01:28:41,541
That a prostitute can't be
your daughter-in-law.

1195
01:28:42,875 --> 01:28:45,083
Her mother is a prostitute
but the girl isn't.

1196
01:28:46,583 --> 01:28:49,000
Roshni is just 15...

1197
01:28:49,583 --> 01:28:52,958
innocent, untouched and single.

1198
01:29:02,333 --> 01:29:03,416
Let's go.

1199
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:06,458
Hey! Please don't get upset.

1200
01:29:06,958 --> 01:29:09,500
You've brought this gift with love,

1201
01:29:09,791 --> 01:29:11,958
we don't want to insult you
by refusing it.

1202
01:29:12,041 --> 01:29:14,750
There's no pressure,
the decision is yours.

1203
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,958
We... accept the proposal.

1204
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:24,250
You're a lucky girl, darling.

1205
01:29:24,875 --> 01:29:27,041
You have a mother,
and now a mother-in-law.

1206
01:29:27,666 --> 01:29:28,833
A husband...

1207
01:29:29,416 --> 01:29:31,500
and truth be told, a rival too!

1208
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:01,041
Stop sulking.

1209
01:30:02,375 --> 01:30:05,083
You'll be the first groom
in Kamathipura's history--

1210
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:06,583
Don't you have a heart?

1211
01:30:11,333 --> 01:30:12,625
I mean nothing to you?

1212
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:15,708
Why?

1213
01:30:16,375 --> 01:30:17,625
Why are you doing this?

1214
01:30:18,375 --> 01:30:20,291
If you were in my place,
what would you do?

1215
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:22,458
I would love you,

1216
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:24,291
keep you happy...

1217
01:30:24,416 --> 01:30:25,708
I would make a life with you.

1218
01:30:26,041 --> 01:30:30,666
That's what I am doing, making your life.
You can't be my love affair all your life.

1219
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,458
You're willing to sacrifice me
just to win an election?

1220
01:30:43,541 --> 01:30:44,916
Not for the election.

1221
01:30:46,166 --> 01:30:50,083
For the women of Kamathipura,
Gangu is willing to sacrifice 100 Afshans!

1222
01:30:56,458 --> 01:30:57,666
Is your decision final?

1223
01:30:59,375 --> 01:31:00,625
It's final.

1224
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:04,000
-Should I get off?
-No.

1225
01:31:04,708 --> 01:31:06,333
Stay for a bit...

1226
01:31:08,666 --> 01:31:09,791
then get off.

1227
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,125
Looking at your lover's
wedding procession?

1228
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:05,958
No.

1229
01:32:06,625 --> 01:32:08,750
I'm looking at Razia's funeral procession!

1230
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:11,125
She is done for.

1231
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,041
And you've become great.

1232
01:32:13,583 --> 01:32:16,041
Who asked you to sacrifice
your happiness for us?

1233
01:32:17,625 --> 01:32:19,166
Doesn't it hurt?

1234
01:32:20,958 --> 01:32:22,208
A lot!

1235
01:32:23,208 --> 01:32:25,500
It hurts like hell, Kamli.

1236
01:32:41,166 --> 01:32:47,083
<i>To spend each evening lost in memories</i>

1237
01:32:47,375 --> 01:32:51,208
<i>A lover needs to have</i>

1238
01:32:51,291 --> 01:32:54,875
<i>A courageous heart</i>

1239
01:32:55,250 --> 01:33:00,833
<i>To die a little every day</i>

1240
01:33:00,916 --> 01:33:05,500
<i>Is what it takes</i>

1241
01:33:05,625 --> 01:33:11,375
<i>To love deeply</i>

1242
01:33:17,875 --> 01:33:23,708
<i>I've heard there are many complaints</i>

1243
01:33:23,791 --> 01:33:28,833
<i>I've heard there are many complaints</i>

1244
01:33:29,416 --> 01:33:35,083
<i>It can only mean</i>
<i>That his love for me runs deep</i>

1245
01:33:35,166 --> 01:33:40,750
<i>I've heard that he is a heart-breaker</i>

1246
01:33:40,833 --> 01:33:46,291
<i>I've had my heart broken many a time too</i>

1247
01:33:46,375 --> 01:33:51,583
<i>I've heard there are many complaints</i>

1248
01:33:51,666 --> 01:33:54,416
<i>He doesn't look at me lovingly</i>

1249
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:57,500
<i>Nor does he think about me</i>

1250
01:33:57,583 --> 01:34:00,250
<i>No, he doesn't even think about me</i>

1251
01:34:00,333 --> 01:34:02,833
<i>We cross paths every day</i>

1252
01:34:02,916 --> 01:34:05,958
<i>But he does not even stop me</i>

1253
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:09,208
<i>No, he doesn't even stop me</i>

1254
01:34:09,291 --> 01:34:11,958
<i>No, he doesn't even stop me</i>

1255
01:34:15,208 --> 01:34:20,791
<i>I've heard that he hates me</i>

1256
01:34:20,875 --> 01:34:26,583
<i>It is in his hatred that I find solace</i>

1257
01:34:26,666 --> 01:34:32,291
<i>I've heard there are many complaints</i>

1258
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:37,541
<i>I've heard there are many complaints</i>

1259
01:34:54,958 --> 01:35:00,666
<i>Go ahead and desert me if you like</i>

1260
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:06,500
<i>But look at me with love at least</i>

1261
01:35:06,583 --> 01:35:12,208
<i>I am disillusioned by promises of loyalty</i>

1262
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:17,375
<i>Still I permit you to make those mistakes</i>

1263
01:35:17,458 --> 01:35:20,250
<i>His mistakes do not anger me</i>

1264
01:35:20,333 --> 01:35:23,333
<i>There is no distance between us</i>

1265
01:35:23,416 --> 01:35:25,666
<i>There is no distance between us</i>

1266
01:35:26,041 --> 01:35:28,708
-Wow!
-<i>No matter what blame he lays upon me</i>

1267
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:32,041
<i>I will always remain loyal to him</i>

1268
01:35:32,166 --> 01:35:35,250
<i>Yes, I'll always be loyal</i>

1269
01:35:35,333 --> 01:35:37,791
<i>Yes, I'll always be loyal</i>

1270
01:35:40,833 --> 01:35:46,458
<i>I've heard, he has forgotten me</i>

1271
01:35:46,583 --> 01:35:52,083
<i>But I have a treasure trove of memories</i>

1272
01:35:52,208 --> 01:35:57,375
<i>I've heard there are many complaints</i>

1273
01:35:57,458 --> 01:36:00,291
<i>I've heard there are many complaints</i>

1274
01:36:00,375 --> 01:36:02,791
<i>Yes, I've also heard, his love runs deep</i>

1275
01:36:02,916 --> 01:36:05,833
<i>Yes, in his hatred I find solace</i>

1276
01:36:05,958 --> 01:36:08,583
<i>I've had my heart broken many a time</i>

1277
01:36:08,875 --> 01:36:11,500
<i>Complaints, love, solace, I have them all</i>

1278
01:36:11,583 --> 01:36:14,541
<i>I have a treasure trove of memories</i>

1279
01:36:14,625 --> 01:36:17,750
<i>I've heard all this...</i>

1280
01:36:17,833 --> 01:36:24,000
<i>I've heard...</i>

1281
01:36:27,625 --> 01:36:31,750
<i>I've heard</i>

1282
01:36:32,166 --> 01:36:35,958
<i>There are many complaints</i>

1283
01:36:44,208 --> 01:36:45,416
Gangu!

1284
01:36:46,208 --> 01:36:47,750
The election results are out.

1285
01:36:48,708 --> 01:36:49,541
And?

1286
01:36:49,625 --> 01:36:51,083
And...

1287
01:36:51,541 --> 01:36:53,166
-You've won!
-You've won!

1288
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:54,666
You are our President now.

1289
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:57,833
Come, all of Kamathipura
is waiting for you down at the cafe.

1290
01:36:57,916 --> 01:36:59,250
Come on, hurry up.

1291
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:24,875
Gangubai!

1292
01:37:28,416 --> 01:37:30,416
<i>Nalli nihari</i> for everyone, on me.

1293
01:37:32,291 --> 01:37:35,375
And send two portions to Razia also.

1294
01:37:36,875 --> 01:37:38,875
I had warned Razia,

1295
01:37:39,625 --> 01:37:43,166
I'd defeat her on her home ground,
and I did it!

1296
01:37:45,875 --> 01:37:48,000
Destiny took my childhood home away,

1297
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:52,791
but it doesn't matter...

1298
01:37:54,583 --> 01:37:57,583
You have made me the President
of Kamathipura today.

1299
01:37:58,375 --> 01:37:59,458
Thank you.

1300
01:37:59,833 --> 01:38:01,791
You've given Gangu so much love.

1301
01:38:05,083 --> 01:38:06,041
Thank you.

1302
01:38:08,125 --> 01:38:11,375
Gangu will return your love
with interest, it's my promise

1303
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:14,500
to everyone... to you, and you...

1304
01:38:16,041 --> 01:38:19,541
Oh, Rashmi!

1305
01:38:21,125 --> 01:38:22,625
Will you be my secretary?

1306
01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:33,250
Gangubai will say three things...

1307
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:34,875
First,

1308
01:38:36,125 --> 01:38:40,000
people think we're dishonest, no problem.

1309
01:38:41,375 --> 01:38:44,708
But do this dishonest work with honesty.

1310
01:38:44,875 --> 01:38:46,541
Complete honesty!

1311
01:38:47,916 --> 01:38:48,791
Second,

1312
01:38:49,625 --> 01:38:51,750
a flower, by nature, is fragrant...

1313
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,791
whether it's in a temple or a shrine,
at a brothel or a funeral...

1314
01:38:56,875 --> 01:38:58,666
spread your fragrance!

1315
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:01,875
Satisfy your clients fully...

1316
01:39:02,541 --> 01:39:04,875
but also remember to get paid... fully!

1317
01:39:06,208 --> 01:39:07,750
We want progress.

1318
01:39:12,333 --> 01:39:13,666
Third,

1319
01:39:15,791 --> 01:39:17,416
live with dignity.

1320
01:39:18,666 --> 01:39:20,166
Never fear anyone.

1321
01:39:21,125 --> 01:39:26,541
Be it the police, be it an MLA
or a minister or a pimp. Fear no one.

1322
01:39:28,333 --> 01:39:33,625
When women are the embodiment
of power, wealth and intelligence,

1323
01:39:34,625 --> 01:39:37,208
what makes these men feel so superior?

1324
01:39:37,291 --> 01:39:39,500
Well said! Bravo! Bravo!

1325
01:39:58,041 --> 01:40:00,083
Don't move.

1326
01:40:03,291 --> 01:40:04,375
Kamli!

1327
01:40:04,833 --> 01:40:06,541
Stop screaming out my name.

1328
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:08,750
You wanted a golden tooth, right?

1329
01:40:08,875 --> 01:40:10,000
Now bear the pain!

1330
01:40:14,375 --> 01:40:16,375
They are back for a raid!

1331
01:40:17,041 --> 01:40:19,291
Gangu, this time they're raiding Lane 14.

1332
01:40:20,875 --> 01:40:22,250
-What?
-Hold on.

1333
01:40:23,583 --> 01:40:25,291
It's the third one this week.

1334
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:27,625
These cops are acting too smart.

1335
01:40:28,125 --> 01:40:30,291
I'll have to find out what's going on.

1336
01:40:30,458 --> 01:40:32,791
Khan needs to be tightened again.

1337
01:40:37,375 --> 01:40:38,416
Come back, Doctor.

1338
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,250
Open your mouth.

1339
01:40:41,833 --> 01:40:44,000
Wider. Open wider.

1340
01:40:44,083 --> 01:40:46,708
Are you going to shove
all of China in my mouth?

1341
01:40:51,166 --> 01:40:52,458
One, two, three...

1342
01:40:52,541 --> 01:40:55,833
These cops are conducting too many raids.
Time to bribe them.

1343
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,125
Four, five, six... This is for <i>Navratri</i>.
We'll make it a grand affair!

1344
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:04,000
Seven, eight, nine, ten.
Put this in the girls' bank accounts.

1345
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:07,375
-What did the bank manager say?
-I tried my best,

1346
01:41:07,458 --> 01:41:10,333
but they refuse to open
bank accounts for our girls.

1347
01:41:10,416 --> 01:41:13,625
But they're okay opening
our girls' clothes?

1348
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:15,416
Great!

1349
01:41:15,583 --> 01:41:17,583
One, two, three, four, five...

1350
01:41:17,666 --> 01:41:20,375
No... this is for my jewelry.

1351
01:41:20,875 --> 01:41:21,916
Go,

1352
01:41:22,083 --> 01:41:24,708
Arrange a meeting
with the manager tomorrow.

1353
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,208
-Madam!
-Yes.

1354
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,166
Yes, Nimmi.

1355
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:31,666
I'm going to my village.

1356
01:41:32,041 --> 01:41:33,708
Give it another thought,

1357
01:41:34,125 --> 01:41:36,375
finish your tuberculosis treatment first.

1358
01:41:36,458 --> 01:41:38,208
I'm afraid I'll die, madam.

1359
01:41:38,791 --> 01:41:42,250
Before that happens,
I want to see my mother once.

1360
01:41:43,833 --> 01:41:45,958
Maybe she has forgiven me now.

1361
01:41:46,333 --> 01:41:47,458
Maybe...

1362
01:41:49,291 --> 01:41:52,083
And if she hasn't, come back to us.

1363
01:41:53,375 --> 01:41:55,416
There are enough people here
to perform your last rites.

1364
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,125
I'll leave.

1365
01:42:11,666 --> 01:42:14,000
-Yes?
<i>-Booked a two-minute call to Kathiawar?</i>

1366
01:42:14,083 --> 01:42:15,541
-Yes.
<i>-Stay on line.</i>

1367
01:42:15,625 --> 01:42:17,041
-<i>I will connect you.</i>
-Yes.

1368
01:42:17,916 --> 01:42:18,750
<i>Hello?</i>

1369
01:42:21,166 --> 01:42:22,041
<i>Hello?</i>

1370
01:42:23,083 --> 01:42:25,166
<i>No one's saying anything.</i>

1371
01:42:26,041 --> 01:42:27,541
-Mom...
<i>-Who?</i>

1372
01:42:28,583 --> 01:42:29,916
<i>Who is it?</i>

1373
01:42:30,458 --> 01:42:33,583
Gangu... Ganga... it's me, Ganga.

1374
01:42:36,083 --> 01:42:39,833
-Mom, it's me, Ganga.
<i>-I heard you.</i>

1375
01:42:39,916 --> 01:42:41,916
<i>You're calling me after 12 years?</i>

1376
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,458
Yes... I still remember
our telephone number after 12 years.

1377
01:42:46,958 --> 01:42:48,583
4234.

1378
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:52,166
-I'll always remember it.
<i>-Anything else?</i>

1379
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:54,500
<i>I have to go to the temple,</i>
<i>I'm getting late.</i>

1380
01:42:54,583 --> 01:42:57,375
Oh, your cupboard keys, I have--

1381
01:42:57,458 --> 01:43:00,041
<i>Is this why you've called</i>
<i>after so many years?</i>

1382
01:43:02,375 --> 01:43:03,416
No...

1383
01:43:05,625 --> 01:43:08,333
I miss you, Mom. A lot.

1384
01:43:08,416 --> 01:43:09,416
<i>It's Ganga...</i>

1385
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:10,958
<i>What do I talk about?</i>

1386
01:43:11,041 --> 01:43:12,625
<i>-Why did she call?</i>
<i>-I don't know.</i>

1387
01:43:12,708 --> 01:43:14,291
<i>-I don't understand...</i>
-Who are you talking to?

1388
01:43:14,375 --> 01:43:15,958
Talk to me.

1389
01:43:16,041 --> 01:43:18,375
<i>What is there to talk about? Huh?</i>

1390
01:43:18,958 --> 01:43:20,125
I know you're angry.

1391
01:43:21,416 --> 01:43:22,291
It's okay.

1392
01:43:23,958 --> 01:43:25,833
Where is dad? Will he talk to me?

1393
01:43:25,916 --> 01:43:27,125
<i>He is no more.</i>

1394
01:43:28,166 --> 01:43:30,250
<i>And yes, you should know...</i>

1395
01:43:30,958 --> 01:43:33,916
<i>he refused to drink Gangajal</i>
<i>at the time of his death,</i>

1396
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:35,958
<i>as it has your name in it.</i>

1397
01:43:36,041 --> 01:43:37,458
<i>Thirty seconds left.</i>

1398
01:43:37,541 --> 01:43:38,625
One second.

1399
01:43:38,708 --> 01:43:41,208
Mom, dad refused
the <i>Gangajal</i> because of--

1400
01:43:41,291 --> 01:43:45,125
-<i>Thirty seconds left.</i>
-Hey! What is this "30 seconds" nonsense!

1401
01:43:45,541 --> 01:43:46,916
My father is dead.

1402
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,958
I'm supposed to mourn in 30 seconds?

1403
01:43:49,541 --> 01:43:52,958
My mom is angry, she won't talk to me.
I want her to hear me out.

1404
01:43:53,041 --> 01:43:54,666
I need to tell her
about the last 12 years!

1405
01:43:54,750 --> 01:43:56,416
How do I do that in 30 seconds?

1406
01:43:57,958 --> 01:44:01,916
What I've been through over these years...
How much I've craved for her love...

1407
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,750
How do I say all this...

1408
01:44:06,625 --> 01:44:08,166
in 30 seconds?

1409
01:44:34,166 --> 01:44:35,541
Rama!

1410
01:44:36,291 --> 01:44:38,666
Come, my love. Make this <i>rangoli</i> with us.

1411
01:44:40,333 --> 01:44:44,125
Gangu, your idea to celebrate
<i>Navratri</i> is great!

1412
01:44:46,416 --> 01:44:47,916
But why do you look sad?

1413
01:44:49,041 --> 01:44:51,458
I really miss my home during <i>Navratri</i>.

1414
01:44:52,458 --> 01:44:53,291
Never mind.

1415
01:44:54,041 --> 01:44:56,708
Tonight we'll celebrate <i>Navratri</i>
in our neighborhood.

1416
01:44:57,958 --> 01:44:59,375
And I've decided,

1417
01:44:59,666 --> 01:45:01,875
no man will lay a hand on us tonight.

1418
01:45:02,916 --> 01:45:03,916
Just imagine

1419
01:45:04,291 --> 01:45:07,458
how frustrated that would make them.

1420
01:45:10,208 --> 01:45:11,958
I'm three months pregnant.

1421
01:45:13,083 --> 01:45:14,375
I've decided

1422
01:45:15,458 --> 01:45:17,041
to have the child this time.

1423
01:45:18,083 --> 01:45:20,208
At least I'll have someone to call my own.

1424
01:45:31,375 --> 01:45:34,333
<i>O Goddess of Power, come and bless us</i>

1425
01:45:34,416 --> 01:45:39,541
<i>As we play garba together</i>

1426
01:45:45,541 --> 01:45:47,500
<i>Drummer...</i>

1427
01:45:48,708 --> 01:45:50,333
<i>Drummer...</i>

1428
01:45:52,208 --> 01:45:53,708
<i>My dear friends</i>

1429
01:45:53,791 --> 01:45:55,333
<i>Let us dance and twirl</i>

1430
01:45:55,416 --> 01:45:58,458
<i>As the drummer plays the drum</i>

1431
01:45:58,541 --> 01:46:01,833
<i>Hey, drummer, play the drums</i>

1432
01:46:01,916 --> 01:46:05,041
<i>Hey, drummer, play the drums</i>

1433
01:46:05,125 --> 01:46:08,291
<i>Hey, drummer, play the drums</i>

1434
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:11,333
<i>As the wind dances on the drums</i>

1435
01:46:11,666 --> 01:46:14,875
<i>Hey, drummer, play the drums</i>

1436
01:46:14,958 --> 01:46:18,000
<i>Hey, drummer, play the drums</i>

1437
01:46:37,958 --> 01:46:41,000
<i>My heart skips a beat</i>

1438
01:46:41,083 --> 01:46:44,458
<i>I dance with abandon</i>

1439
01:46:44,541 --> 01:46:47,583
<i>I seem to have lost my senses</i>

1440
01:46:47,666 --> 01:46:51,041
<i>As I get high on the drum beats</i>

1441
01:46:51,125 --> 01:46:53,916
<i>My heart skips a beat</i>

1442
01:46:54,125 --> 01:46:57,333
<i>I dance with abandon</i>

1443
01:46:57,625 --> 01:47:00,375
<i>I seem to have lost my senses</i>

1444
01:47:00,458 --> 01:47:03,500
<i>As I get high on the drum beats</i>

1445
01:47:04,083 --> 01:47:07,208
<i>Hey, drummer, play the drums</i>

1446
01:47:07,291 --> 01:47:10,333
<i>Hey, drummer, play the drums</i>

1447
01:47:10,458 --> 01:47:13,666
<i>Hey, drummer, play the drums</i>

1448
01:47:13,833 --> 01:47:16,583
<i>As the wind dances on the drums</i>

1449
01:47:16,791 --> 01:47:20,166
<i>Our beloved Goddess</i>

1450
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:24,291
<i>Goddess Amba of Arasur</i>

1451
01:47:25,208 --> 01:47:28,250
<i>The Goddess of Pawagarh</i>

1452
01:47:28,375 --> 01:47:32,500
<i>Goddess Mahakali</i>
<i>The drums play in Your honor</i>

1453
01:47:36,458 --> 01:47:39,666
<i>O Goddess, Your beauty is exceptional</i>

1454
01:47:40,166 --> 01:47:44,208
<i>Your beauty knows no bounds</i>

1455
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:48,208
<i>The sun, moon and stars</i>

1456
01:47:48,333 --> 01:47:52,208
<i>Praise Your virtues</i>

1457
01:47:52,916 --> 01:47:56,166
<i>I bow down before You, O Goddess</i>

1458
01:47:56,250 --> 01:48:00,791
<i>You are our savior</i>

1459
01:48:00,875 --> 01:48:04,458
<i>You, who reside on the mountain peak</i>

1460
01:48:04,541 --> 01:48:07,291
<i>The powerful Goddess Chandi</i>

1461
01:48:07,375 --> 01:48:10,583
<i>The powerful Goddess Chandi...</i>

1462
01:48:31,958 --> 01:48:33,416
Assalamu alaikum, sir.

1463
01:48:34,083 --> 01:48:35,375
Alaikum assalam, Gangu.

1464
01:48:36,083 --> 01:48:39,291
-How was the <i>Navratri</i> celebration?
-Fantastic.

1465
01:48:40,166 --> 01:48:42,083
We danced the night away.

1466
01:48:42,666 --> 01:48:45,375
For the first time
in the history of Kamathipura,

1467
01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:48,250
I closed our business for an entire night.

1468
01:48:49,375 --> 01:48:50,875
Meet these two gentlemen.

1469
01:48:51,916 --> 01:48:55,000
They have come to close down
your business once and for all.

1470
01:48:56,250 --> 01:48:57,458
What do you mean?

1471
01:48:58,333 --> 01:49:01,125
He is the Secretary of Ward C, Mr. Shah.

1472
01:49:01,666 --> 01:49:06,666
He has drafted a petition along
with the school behind Lane 14

1473
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:10,291
to vacate everyone from Kamathipura!

1474
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:13,416
But why?

1475
01:49:13,916 --> 01:49:16,625
What have we done wrong?

1476
01:49:16,958 --> 01:49:19,458
They say you're bad influence
on the students.

1477
01:49:22,916 --> 01:49:26,208
Being located near a brothel
is bad influence on the school?

1478
01:49:27,125 --> 01:49:30,958
Then why isn't being located near
a school a good influence on the brothel?

1479
01:49:32,583 --> 01:49:36,833
Mr. Rahim, what say do we have
in front of the school board?

1480
01:49:37,083 --> 01:49:39,166
Ward C has also supported them.

1481
01:49:39,541 --> 01:49:41,166
And supported the builder too.

1482
01:49:42,458 --> 01:49:45,291
Using this as an excuse,
you want to vacate their area

1483
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,250
and build skyscrapers there.

1484
01:49:48,333 --> 01:49:50,458
May I say something, sir?

1485
01:49:50,541 --> 01:49:52,458
This petition will benefit everyone.

1486
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:54,166
I'll speak to the builder

1487
01:49:54,541 --> 01:49:57,958
and get one flat each for you and madam.

1488
01:50:03,041 --> 01:50:08,750
Trying to bribe a free bird
with a measly cage?

1489
01:50:09,958 --> 01:50:11,875
Sir... What the...

1490
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:13,333
This is an insult!

1491
01:50:13,625 --> 01:50:14,458
It is.

1492
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,375
You're insulted
just because your shirt is torn.

1493
01:50:18,166 --> 01:50:21,625
And tearing down their homes
isn't an insult to them?

1494
01:50:23,083 --> 01:50:25,250
Lala likes to make homes,

1495
01:50:25,958 --> 01:50:27,208
not break them!

1496
01:50:28,375 --> 01:50:30,083
If you dare do this again,

1497
01:50:30,916 --> 01:50:32,958
I'll make sure you go home naked.

1498
01:50:33,958 --> 01:50:34,833
Goodbye.

1499
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,250
Let's go.

1500
01:50:42,291 --> 01:50:43,958
Listen to me carefully, Gangu.

1501
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,750
The government will send you
a notice in two days.

1502
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:50,208
I'll handle the builders.

1503
01:50:50,791 --> 01:50:52,833
But the school authorities

1504
01:50:53,458 --> 01:50:55,500
will drag you to court.

1505
01:50:56,583 --> 01:50:59,958
I can tackle these neighborhood battles,
but court--

1506
01:51:00,083 --> 01:51:01,791
Turn your fear into your strength.

1507
01:51:03,125 --> 01:51:05,250
The lives of 4,000 women depend on you.

1508
01:51:05,875 --> 01:51:06,833
If you lose,

1509
01:51:07,208 --> 01:51:10,000
you lose not once, but 4,000 times.

1510
01:51:10,416 --> 01:51:13,625
Gangu, you must win this battle!

1511
01:51:16,708 --> 01:51:19,916
-End prostitution!
-End prostitution!

1512
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,708
-Vacate Kamathipura!
-Vacate Kamathipura

1513
01:51:22,791 --> 01:51:25,791
-End prostitution!
-End prostitution!

1514
01:51:25,875 --> 01:51:28,750
-Vacate Kamathipura!
-Vacate Kamathipura!

1515
01:51:28,833 --> 01:51:31,791
-Shame on Gangubai!
-Shame on Gangubai!

1516
01:51:31,916 --> 01:51:33,708
What? Turn your head, silly girl!

1517
01:51:33,791 --> 01:51:35,916
-You hear this nonsense?
-I hear them.

1518
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:38,041
They think I'll get scared.

1519
01:51:38,125 --> 01:51:40,625
So fighting the case
for the last five months

1520
01:51:40,708 --> 01:51:42,333
has all gone to waste, Gangu.

1521
01:51:42,666 --> 01:51:44,375
They're in the neighborhood.

1522
01:51:44,541 --> 01:51:46,541
What if they come into our house?

1523
01:51:47,333 --> 01:51:48,500
Attack.

1524
01:51:49,333 --> 01:51:50,375
What?

1525
01:51:50,750 --> 01:51:52,458
I mean...

1526
01:51:54,666 --> 01:51:55,541
Attack!

1527
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:58,958
-Vacate Kamathipura!
-Vacate Kamathipura!

1528
01:51:59,041 --> 01:52:01,916
-End prostitution!
-End prostitution!

1529
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,875
-Vacate Kamathipura!
-Vacate Kamathipura!

1530
01:52:04,958 --> 01:52:08,625
Shame on Gangubai!

1531
01:52:08,708 --> 01:52:11,875
Shame on Gangubai!

1532
01:52:11,958 --> 01:52:14,833
Vacate Kamathipura!

1533
01:52:14,916 --> 01:52:21,041
Shame on Gangubai!

1534
01:52:21,125 --> 01:52:23,875
Shame on Gangubai!

1535
01:52:24,291 --> 01:52:26,791
You don't understand, Mr. Fezi,
this is a girls' school.

1536
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:32,041
If 14-15 year old girls see such
immoral activities going on outside,

1537
01:52:32,125 --> 01:52:33,583
how will it affect them?

1538
01:52:33,666 --> 01:52:36,875
Are you saying that everything
that's wrong with the world

1539
01:52:36,958 --> 01:52:38,666
resides in this neighborhood?

1540
01:52:39,041 --> 01:52:39,958
Yes, exactly.

1541
01:52:40,041 --> 01:52:44,666
That's why we got this petition signed,
to remove those people from here.

1542
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:47,583
Then you should
get the entire city vacated.

1543
01:52:48,375 --> 01:52:52,250
{\an8}-Immorality resides everywhere.
-Come on, sit here quietly.

1544
01:52:52,333 --> 01:52:53,625
{\an8}Khushbu, don't make noise.

1545
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,875
{\an8}Hello, Mr. Principal.

1546
01:52:55,958 --> 01:52:57,250
{\an8}These are my daughters.

1547
01:52:57,333 --> 01:53:00,750
{\an8}See how neatly they've dressed up
to meet you.

1548
01:53:00,875 --> 01:53:02,875
{\an8}Yeah, I see... but who are you?

1549
01:53:03,208 --> 01:53:05,583
{\an8}And how did you get in without permission?

1550
01:53:05,666 --> 01:53:08,791
{\an8}Just like how you sent us a notice
without permission!

1551
01:53:08,875 --> 01:53:12,000
{\an8}Truth be told, that's when
I found out that this school

1552
01:53:12,083 --> 01:53:13,458
{\an8}has been here for 40 years.

1553
01:53:13,541 --> 01:53:16,250
{\an8}Now that you know,
leave this neighborhood.

1554
01:53:17,333 --> 01:53:20,875
Sister, your school
has been here for 40 years,

1555
01:53:20,958 --> 01:53:23,416
{\an8}and we have been here for a 100 years!

1556
01:53:24,750 --> 01:53:27,750
Didn't you think
when you were constructing the school

1557
01:53:27,833 --> 01:53:29,625
that there's a brothel next door?

1558
01:53:31,583 --> 01:53:36,041
{\an8}Father, all this protesting
is affecting our business.

1559
01:53:36,541 --> 01:53:38,083
{\an8}Clients are scared to come.

1560
01:53:38,166 --> 01:53:40,041
{\an8}The children barely have food.

1561
01:53:42,041 --> 01:53:44,166
{\an8}Stop ringing the bell, Father!

1562
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:47,958
{\an8}One call from me and the entire
neighborhood will land up here.

1563
01:53:48,583 --> 01:53:50,125
{\an8}Don't start a war.

1564
01:53:52,125 --> 01:53:54,458
Why are you writing down all this?
Who are you?

1565
01:53:54,541 --> 01:53:57,458
I'm a reporter...
Hamid Fezi, Urdu Times.

1566
01:53:58,208 --> 01:53:59,791
-Journalist?
-Yes.

1567
01:54:00,833 --> 01:54:02,958
I'm a Prostitute... Gangubai!

1568
01:54:05,708 --> 01:54:08,750
Are you done talking?
You may leave now.

1569
01:54:08,833 --> 01:54:11,500
My dear Sister, I will leave,

1570
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:14,875
but only after my children
get admission in this school.

1571
01:54:15,875 --> 01:54:17,833
{\an8}I've even got the school fees.

1572
01:54:17,958 --> 01:54:20,458
{\an8}Here, five years' fees for eight girls.

1573
01:54:20,541 --> 01:54:21,583
Take it back.

1574
01:54:22,250 --> 01:54:24,250
We cannot enroll your girls here.

1575
01:54:25,791 --> 01:54:29,291
So what if they're from a brothel?
They have a right to education.

1576
01:54:30,041 --> 01:54:31,958
And I'll make sure they get it, Father.

1577
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:39,125
Imagine, if one of them becomes
a doctor, an engineer or a barrister...

1578
01:54:39,250 --> 01:54:41,041
Her life will change.

1579
01:54:41,541 --> 01:54:44,083
{\an8}Then you won't have any complaints, right?

1580
01:54:44,166 --> 01:54:45,166
{\an8}Of course.

1581
01:54:45,875 --> 01:54:46,750
{\an8}Another thing...

1582
01:54:47,333 --> 01:54:50,875
A-aah, E-eeh, O-ooh...

1583
01:54:51,333 --> 01:54:54,000
They learn these sounds in the brothel.

1584
01:54:55,875 --> 01:54:57,791
The rest, you can teach them here.

1585
01:54:58,916 --> 01:55:02,333
Come on, Sister,
take out the admission form.

1586
01:55:02,416 --> 01:55:05,125
{\an8}Write... Mother's name,
Gangubai Kathiawadi.

1587
01:55:05,375 --> 01:55:06,416
{\an8}And father?

1588
01:55:07,166 --> 01:55:08,750
What should
we write as the father's name?

1589
01:55:11,291 --> 01:55:12,916
The mother's name is not enough, huh?

1590
01:55:14,791 --> 01:55:16,916
All right, father's name, Dev Anand.

1591
01:55:18,291 --> 01:55:21,583
Everyone's father's name
is Dev Anand. Happy?

1592
01:55:22,166 --> 01:55:23,375
Admission complete?

1593
01:55:24,416 --> 01:55:26,958
Girls, say "thank you" to Father.

1594
01:55:27,041 --> 01:55:29,791
-Thank you, Father.
-Thank you, Father.

1595
01:55:29,875 --> 01:55:31,666
See, Mr. Fezi, what a great day!

1596
01:55:32,208 --> 01:55:34,708
My girls only had a mother until now,

1597
01:55:35,166 --> 01:55:36,625
now they have a Father too!

1598
01:55:38,875 --> 01:55:40,875
{\an8}Thank you, Father. Thank you.

1599
01:55:43,666 --> 01:55:45,291
Visit us at the brothel sometime.

1600
01:55:45,958 --> 01:55:48,416
You'll find young girls
and good stories too!

1601
01:55:49,750 --> 01:55:52,375
Come, children,
it's time to buy your uniforms.

1602
01:55:52,458 --> 01:55:53,666
Don't make noise.

1603
01:55:53,750 --> 01:55:55,375
Buy us popsicles too.

1604
01:55:55,458 --> 01:55:57,625
No popsicles! You'll catch a cold.

1605
01:56:00,125 --> 01:56:02,208
<i>I hope he arrives--</i>

1606
01:56:02,541 --> 01:56:03,708
Madam.

1607
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:06,583
Some Mr. Farzi is here to meet you.

1608
01:56:06,791 --> 01:56:08,166
Who's Mr. Farzi?

1609
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:12,125
Idiot! It must be Mr. Fezi, not Farzi!

1610
01:56:12,208 --> 01:56:13,583
A journalist. Let him in.

1611
01:56:13,958 --> 01:56:15,291
I'll send him in.

1612
01:56:17,166 --> 01:56:21,166
Come in, Mr. Fezi.

1613
01:56:22,125 --> 01:56:24,291
The newspaper has found
its way to a brothel!

1614
01:56:24,375 --> 01:56:27,208
Sorry,
I came without informing you.

1615
01:56:27,708 --> 01:56:29,416
Who makes an appointment to come here?

1616
01:56:30,166 --> 01:56:31,625
-Please sit.
-Thank you.

1617
01:56:33,041 --> 01:56:35,458
Ms. Gangu, I wanted to ask you--

1618
01:56:37,416 --> 01:56:39,125
Why are you laughing?

1619
01:56:39,208 --> 01:56:42,416
It's the first time someone has
addressed me with respect.

1620
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,208
What brings you here?

1621
01:56:44,291 --> 01:56:47,416
Did your girls
get enrolled in that school?

1622
01:56:47,541 --> 01:56:48,875
Why wouldn't they?

1623
01:56:49,333 --> 01:56:52,250
In fact, today I dropped them
to the class myself.

1624
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:53,625
They cried a lot...

1625
01:56:53,708 --> 01:56:56,125
but I told them to study well
or they'd be punished!

1626
01:56:56,416 --> 01:56:58,750
May I take your photograph, Ms. Gangu?

1627
01:56:58,833 --> 01:56:59,708
My photograph?

1628
01:57:00,166 --> 01:57:02,250
I'm no movie star.

1629
01:57:02,583 --> 01:57:04,583
But you're the star of Kamathipura.

1630
01:57:06,083 --> 01:57:07,250
Anyway,

1631
01:57:07,583 --> 01:57:11,250
a magazine interview
without a photograph is incomplete.

1632
01:57:11,333 --> 01:57:13,458
Are you interviewing me, Mr. Fezi?

1633
01:57:14,208 --> 01:57:16,166
Our services come with a price.

1634
01:57:17,375 --> 01:57:20,750
And even if you publish my photograph,
who reads magazines here?

1635
01:57:21,208 --> 01:57:22,375
Maybe not here,

1636
01:57:22,666 --> 01:57:24,625
but people across the world will read it.

1637
01:57:24,708 --> 01:57:26,041
The world...

1638
01:57:26,125 --> 01:57:29,000
By the way,
what's your educational qualifications?

1639
01:57:29,125 --> 01:57:30,458
I've studied until ninth grade.

1640
01:57:30,541 --> 01:57:32,250
And where are you from?

1641
01:57:33,083 --> 01:57:34,125
Kathiawar.

1642
01:57:34,250 --> 01:57:36,625
Don't you ever feel
like going back home?

1643
01:57:39,166 --> 01:57:41,375
Stop these annoying questions, Mr. Fezi.

1644
01:57:44,625 --> 01:57:45,833
Enough.

1645
01:57:47,625 --> 01:57:49,000
That's enough for today.

1646
01:57:49,583 --> 01:57:51,333
Come back after two days.

1647
01:57:51,708 --> 01:57:54,000
It's time for me to give this medicine...

1648
01:57:54,083 --> 01:57:55,625
My friend, Kamli,

1649
01:57:56,583 --> 01:57:57,791
she's very sick.

1650
01:57:58,250 --> 01:58:00,333
Pray for her speedy recovery.

1651
01:58:01,041 --> 01:58:02,416
Gangubai...

1652
01:58:03,916 --> 01:58:06,500
What happened?
Why are you back so early?

1653
01:58:06,875 --> 01:58:10,708
-School doesn't get over until 4 pm.
-The teacher hit us and threw us out.

1654
01:58:13,333 --> 01:58:16,083
See, this is the respect we get.

1655
01:58:17,291 --> 01:58:18,708
Come here.

1656
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,041
Take the photograph now, Mr. Fezi.

1657
01:58:25,208 --> 01:58:27,875
And make sure this photo is published
in your magazine

1658
01:58:28,791 --> 01:58:30,208
for the world to see!

1659
01:58:55,458 --> 01:58:56,958
The medicine is not working.

1660
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,916
Now that she's finally a mother,
look at her luck.

1661
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:03,000
She's on her deathbed.

1662
01:59:04,291 --> 01:59:06,166
This child will be the death of her.

1663
01:59:15,166 --> 01:59:16,291
Pammi...

1664
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:18,791
Nothing will happen to Pammi.

1665
01:59:20,416 --> 01:59:21,750
I’ll look after her.

1666
01:59:24,125 --> 01:59:25,500
Take this medicine.

1667
01:59:26,416 --> 01:59:27,916
I made it myself.

1668
01:59:29,750 --> 01:59:31,375
Don't do this, Kamli.

1669
01:59:32,833 --> 01:59:34,500
You're the only friend I have.

1670
01:59:36,833 --> 01:59:37,875
Best friend...

1671
01:59:41,291 --> 01:59:42,541
Best friend.

1672
02:00:34,291 --> 02:00:36,458
-I want to meet Ms. Gangu--
-Not today.

1673
02:00:36,541 --> 02:00:39,333
But she had asked me
to come after two days.

1674
02:00:39,666 --> 02:00:41,083
Kamli passed away.

1675
02:00:42,250 --> 02:00:43,708
The brothel is shut today.

1676
02:00:51,166 --> 02:00:52,625
She has such thick hair.

1677
02:00:55,333 --> 02:00:57,625
Braiding them takes the life out of you.

1678
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,916
The first time I saw her,

1679
02:01:02,291 --> 02:01:04,333
she was running away from Mr. Mandar

1680
02:01:04,916 --> 02:01:06,916
half naked, her hair in a mess...

1681
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,250
yet so beautiful.

1682
02:01:11,125 --> 02:01:12,250
Forget the man,

1683
02:01:12,666 --> 02:01:15,125
even I was attracted to her!

1684
02:01:16,083 --> 02:01:18,458
She liked everything bling.

1685
02:01:19,458 --> 02:01:25,000
Even in a dark movie hall,
she'd shine brighter than the actress!

1686
02:01:25,333 --> 02:01:26,750
She was crazy.

1687
02:01:27,708 --> 02:01:30,541
The tea-seller, Banwari,
wanted to marry her.

1688
02:01:30,958 --> 02:01:32,166
But she refused.

1689
02:01:33,333 --> 02:01:34,166
She'd say...

1690
02:01:35,333 --> 02:01:38,000
"This moron
will always be suspicious of me."

1691
02:01:38,666 --> 02:01:42,083
"Even if I go to the market,
he'd assume that I'm whoring around."

1692
02:01:46,041 --> 02:01:46,916
Come on,

1693
02:01:47,875 --> 02:01:49,416
it's time to take her away.

1694
02:01:53,833 --> 02:01:54,833
And...

1695
02:01:56,041 --> 02:01:57,833
tie her legs tightly.

1696
02:01:59,666 --> 02:02:02,750
Men cannot be trusted...
not even with a dead body.

1697
02:02:10,791 --> 02:02:12,333
My darling.

1698
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:38,416
-Did you have fun, sir?
-I'll be back.

1699
02:02:41,833 --> 02:02:43,125
Hey, Mr. Fezi!

1700
02:02:43,208 --> 02:02:45,541
Oh, Ms. Gangu.

1701
02:02:45,625 --> 02:02:47,875
I went to the house
looking for you and you're here.

1702
02:02:47,958 --> 02:02:50,166
I'm seeing you after a very long time.
Sit down.

1703
02:02:51,791 --> 02:02:53,541
I have a surprise for you.

1704
02:02:53,875 --> 02:02:55,958
You'll be happy to see it.

1705
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:57,833
I'll make you happier.

1706
02:02:58,041 --> 02:02:59,625
Just try the <i>bheja fry</i> here.

1707
02:02:59,750 --> 02:03:00,625
Hey, Birju!

1708
02:03:00,708 --> 02:03:01,958
Get Fezi a--

1709
02:03:11,666 --> 02:03:12,958
Mr. Fezi...

1710
02:03:13,750 --> 02:03:14,791
Show me, madam.

1711
02:03:14,875 --> 02:03:16,083
See this...

1712
02:03:18,250 --> 02:03:21,208
Wow! You look like a movie star!

1713
02:03:21,291 --> 02:03:23,458
Madhubala is nothing compared to you.

1714
02:03:23,541 --> 02:03:25,583
See how lovely our girls look.

1715
02:03:25,666 --> 02:03:26,833
See...

1716
02:03:27,625 --> 02:03:29,416
-Show me.
-Our madam is famous!

1717
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:31,000
Use this to your advantage.

1718
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:32,750
You're famous now.

1719
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,500
And everyone listens to famous people.

1720
02:03:35,583 --> 02:03:36,750
What fame, Mr. Fezi?

1721
02:03:36,833 --> 02:03:38,583
I understand your pain,

1722
02:03:38,666 --> 02:03:41,208
but it's time for the world to know.

1723
02:03:41,791 --> 02:03:42,666
What do you mean?

1724
02:03:42,750 --> 02:03:47,125
Next week, there's a huge rally
for women's rights at Azad Maidan.

1725
02:03:47,208 --> 02:03:51,166
Education for prostitutes is a topic too.
I've suggested your name to the committee.

1726
02:03:51,750 --> 02:03:52,666
What should I do?

1727
02:03:52,750 --> 02:03:53,875
Nothing much.

1728
02:03:54,250 --> 02:03:58,750
There'll be around 400-500 people,
you have to deliver a speech.

1729
02:03:58,833 --> 02:04:01,750
I can't be lured by all this.

1730
02:04:01,875 --> 02:04:03,500
I can't give speeches.

1731
02:04:03,583 --> 02:04:05,541
No, madam. You have to do this.

1732
02:04:05,625 --> 02:04:06,666
-Right?
-Yes.

1733
02:04:06,750 --> 02:04:08,583
Who else speaks up on our behalf?

1734
02:04:08,666 --> 02:04:10,083
-Exactly.
-Yes.

1735
02:04:10,166 --> 02:04:14,041
And I've already written
something for you.

1736
02:04:14,708 --> 02:04:20,291
Memorize it, and blow everyone away
with your fiery speech.

1737
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:24,625
"Greetings,
my dear brothers and sisters, I..."

1738
02:04:27,375 --> 02:04:28,500
What?

1739
02:04:30,916 --> 02:04:31,916
What is it?

1740
02:04:32,291 --> 02:04:33,541
Brothers?

1741
02:04:35,958 --> 02:04:37,208
Whose "brothers"?

1742
02:04:41,541 --> 02:04:42,708
Listen...

1743
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:47,708
please reach Azad Maidan
at 4 pm on Wednesday.

1744
02:04:49,833 --> 02:04:51,125
Should I pick you up?

1745
02:04:52,208 --> 02:04:54,208
Why are you doing all this for me, Fezi?

1746
02:04:55,375 --> 02:04:56,666
Because...

1747
02:05:06,541 --> 02:05:07,500
Let's go.

1748
02:05:07,583 --> 02:05:09,000
But where are you going?

1749
02:05:09,083 --> 02:05:12,625
Pammi needs to be fed,
and I have to memorize this speech.

1750
02:05:13,333 --> 02:05:16,541
Now that you're here,
enjoy the charms of Kamathipura.

1751
02:05:16,750 --> 02:05:20,208
Girls, take extra care of Mr. Fezi.

1752
02:05:20,291 --> 02:05:22,291
-Sure, madam.
-Let's go, Birju!

1753
02:05:33,791 --> 02:05:34,916
No...

1754
02:05:39,458 --> 02:05:40,833
Madam...

1755
02:05:41,208 --> 02:05:42,750
Why do you call out
when I'm about to leave?

1756
02:05:42,875 --> 02:05:45,500
Fezi called,
asking why you haven't reached yet.

1757
02:05:45,583 --> 02:05:46,958
-Tell him I've left.
-Okay.

1758
02:05:47,041 --> 02:05:48,708
-You packed my glasses?
-Yes.

1759
02:05:48,791 --> 02:05:50,708
-My water bottle?
-Yes.

1760
02:05:50,791 --> 02:05:51,958
-Umbrella?
-Yes.

1761
02:05:52,041 --> 02:05:54,958
-Where's my speech, Birju?
-It's in your hand, madam!

1762
02:05:56,375 --> 02:05:59,958
Don't act too smart, idiot!
Get lost!

1763
02:06:00,500 --> 02:06:02,541
Madam sure is worked up today.

1764
02:06:04,583 --> 02:06:06,708
-What are you smiling at?
-Nothing.

1765
02:06:07,208 --> 02:06:10,000
You're going to give a speech,
seek God's blessings.

1766
02:06:10,083 --> 02:06:12,750
Dear God,
You've let me down so many times,

1767
02:06:12,833 --> 02:06:14,166
don't let me down today.

1768
02:06:14,958 --> 02:06:16,000
Come on, leave.

1769
02:06:16,083 --> 02:06:17,041
Hey, Gangu...

1770
02:06:19,416 --> 02:06:20,250
{\an8}Be safe.

1771
02:06:20,333 --> 02:06:21,791
{\an8}What have I gotten into!

1772
02:06:21,916 --> 02:06:23,875
My dear brothers and sisters, on...

1773
02:06:23,958 --> 02:06:24,958
What was it?

1774
02:06:25,083 --> 02:06:28,250
"Let me welcome the audience
on this auspicious day..."

1775
02:06:28,333 --> 02:06:30,083
Screw the audience!

1776
02:06:30,833 --> 02:06:34,708
Move it!
What are you waiting for? Buffoon.

1777
02:06:42,458 --> 02:06:45,375
Our society can progress
only when we are united,

1778
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:50,708
all religions are seen as equal,
and women are given respect.

1779
02:06:54,250 --> 02:06:55,458
Great!

1780
02:06:56,041 --> 02:07:00,291
The progress of women from all walks
of life should be given importance.

1781
02:07:00,958 --> 02:07:05,791
After Mr. Minister's fiery speech,
the last speaker for this evening,

1782
02:07:06,291 --> 02:07:11,125
to talk about the rights of prostitutes,
is their representative,

1783
02:07:11,416 --> 02:07:15,750
Mrs... er, Miss...

1784
02:07:17,250 --> 02:07:19,125
{\an8}It's okay, let it be...

1785
02:07:19,208 --> 02:07:21,000
{\an8}-Lovely introduction...
-Sorry...

1786
02:07:21,083 --> 02:07:23,125
{\an8}No, thank you for that.

1787
02:07:23,416 --> 02:07:26,625
{\an8}She's confused about our title,
but we've been living with it.

1788
02:07:30,333 --> 02:07:33,625
{\an8}I am Gangubai, President, Kamathipura.

1789
02:07:34,375 --> 02:07:37,541
{\an8}They didn't let me be a "miss"
and nobody made me a "missus".

1790
02:07:45,083 --> 02:07:46,541
{\an8}"Namaste..."

1791
02:07:46,625 --> 02:07:48,583
{\an8}Hey, come here, you.

1792
02:07:50,583 --> 02:07:51,833
Get a chair!

1793
02:07:55,833 --> 02:07:57,375
Get it, darling.

1794
02:07:58,541 --> 02:08:00,625
Keep it here and lower the mic.

1795
02:08:05,541 --> 02:08:06,625
Now leave.

1796
02:08:09,083 --> 02:08:11,625
I'm not used to giving speeches.

1797
02:08:12,250 --> 02:08:13,958
I will say what's in my heart.

1798
02:08:14,541 --> 02:08:18,500
You might find my words
a little offensive but listen carefully.

1799
02:08:19,208 --> 02:08:20,250
You too...

1800
02:08:21,458 --> 02:08:23,458
the caretakers of our society!

1801
02:08:27,625 --> 02:08:29,291
I'll come to the point.

1802
02:08:32,041 --> 02:08:33,541
All of you...

1803
02:08:33,833 --> 02:08:36,791
all of you sitting here
must have some occupation...

1804
02:08:37,166 --> 02:08:38,333
business!

1805
02:08:38,416 --> 02:08:40,916
A doctor, an engineer or a teacher.

1806
02:08:41,375 --> 02:08:44,541
Some sell snacks,
alcohol, clothes, soap or utensils...

1807
02:08:44,625 --> 02:08:46,750
-Isn't it, Fezi?
-Yes.

1808
02:08:48,250 --> 02:08:52,041
A qualified person sells his intelligence
but we sell our bodies.

1809
02:08:52,583 --> 02:08:54,375
We work bloody hard!

1810
02:08:54,458 --> 02:08:55,625
What's wrong in that?

1811
02:08:59,708 --> 02:09:02,416
Why do they object
only to our establishments?

1812
02:09:03,041 --> 02:09:05,333
Why is only our profession
seen as immoral?

1813
02:09:06,458 --> 02:09:09,125
Men from your neighborhood come to ours

1814
02:09:09,208 --> 02:09:11,916
and yet our neighborhood is infamous. Why?

1815
02:09:14,125 --> 02:09:18,041
Do you know what the oldest
profession in the world is?

1816
02:09:19,875 --> 02:09:21,125
Prostitution.

1817
02:09:22,416 --> 02:09:24,708
Without us, even heaven is incomplete.

1818
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:27,791
You must give us some respect,
don't you think?

1819
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,250
To tell you the truth,

1820
02:09:34,125 --> 02:09:37,625
we have more dignity than you.
Ask me how.

1821
02:09:38,375 --> 02:09:40,708
You lose your dignity once,
it's gone forever.

1822
02:09:41,125 --> 02:09:42,958
We sell our dignity every night,

1823
02:09:43,625 --> 02:09:45,791
-yet it doesn't seem to run out.
-Bravo!

1824
02:09:50,458 --> 02:09:52,166
Enough of the photos.

1825
02:09:52,833 --> 02:09:54,125
Stop it already!

1826
02:09:55,958 --> 02:09:59,916
I'm not used to such bright lights.
I belong to the red light area!

1827
02:10:01,583 --> 02:10:02,916
No matter what you think,

1828
02:10:03,291 --> 02:10:05,500
we're women of integrity.

1829
02:10:05,583 --> 02:10:08,500
Sit down now, darling, enough of clicking!

1830
02:10:08,583 --> 02:10:10,833
I'll let you take my photos, sit down.

1831
02:10:14,916 --> 02:10:17,083
No matter who turns up at our doorstep,

1832
02:10:17,250 --> 02:10:19,125
we don't judge them.

1833
02:10:19,375 --> 02:10:20,833
It's our principle...

1834
02:10:21,416 --> 02:10:23,458
we don't ask your religion or caste.

1835
02:10:23,541 --> 02:10:25,916
Dark-skinned, light-skinned,

1836
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,458
rich or poor, everyone pays the same rate.

1837
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,375
When we don't discriminate
among people...

1838
02:10:32,458 --> 02:10:34,333
why do you discriminate against us?

1839
02:10:34,791 --> 02:10:37,083
Why are we excluded from your society?

1840
02:10:37,375 --> 02:10:38,333
True...

1841
02:10:41,541 --> 02:10:44,791
The minister who was preaching
about unity and equality...

1842
02:10:45,666 --> 02:10:47,458
Visit us sometime,

1843
02:10:47,916 --> 02:10:49,583
we practice what you preach!

1844
02:10:51,166 --> 02:10:53,666
Well said, Gangubai! Bravo!

1845
02:10:54,875 --> 02:10:59,500
Okay... It's not that we don't
matter to people, we do...

1846
02:11:00,041 --> 02:11:02,291
To politicians, we are their votes.

1847
02:11:02,750 --> 02:11:06,166
To policemen, we're currency notes.
To men, we're winter coats.

1848
02:11:06,250 --> 02:11:07,333
And to women,

1849
02:11:07,750 --> 02:11:09,625
you all know who we are...

1850
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:15,250
We have fire in us
and yet bloom like a rose.

1851
02:11:15,875 --> 02:11:19,791
We satisfy the lust of men
and protect the integrity of women.

1852
02:11:20,208 --> 02:11:22,833
Bravo! Bravo!

1853
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:28,583
Just imagine...

1854
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:31,833
if there was no Kamathipura...

1855
02:11:33,208 --> 02:11:35,166
this city would turn into a jungle!

1856
02:11:35,375 --> 02:11:38,375
Women will be raped,
families will fall apart,

1857
02:11:38,458 --> 02:11:42,583
relationships will end and our
glorious Indian culture will turn to dust.

1858
02:11:44,250 --> 02:11:46,500
And you will be responsible for this.

1859
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:52,916
We guard not only your dignity
but also the dignity of this society.

1860
02:11:53,458 --> 02:11:55,958
That's why I'm as proud of being
a prostitute

1861
02:11:56,041 --> 02:11:58,500
as you are of being a doctor or a teacher.

1862
02:12:04,083 --> 02:12:05,875
You are applauding my speech,

1863
02:12:06,625 --> 02:12:08,458
but it's funny

1864
02:12:10,250 --> 02:12:12,958
that you're still hell bent
on making us homeless.

1865
02:12:13,708 --> 02:12:17,375
And if that's not enough, you want
to throw our children out of school too.

1866
02:12:19,416 --> 02:12:22,625
I want to ask you all something.
Answer truthfully.

1867
02:12:23,625 --> 02:12:27,083
Don't our children have
the right to education? Huh?

1868
02:12:28,333 --> 02:12:32,375
Aren't our children,
like your children, the future of India?

1869
02:12:32,458 --> 02:12:34,583
Yes! Yes!

1870
02:12:34,666 --> 02:12:35,708
They are!

1871
02:12:35,791 --> 02:12:38,708
And so, Gangu has decided...

1872
02:12:39,250 --> 02:12:42,166
I won't let the women
of Kamathipura become homeless.

1873
02:12:42,541 --> 02:12:45,333
Our children
will get the right to education

1874
02:12:45,416 --> 02:12:48,875
and we will get our right
to live in society with dignity.

1875
02:12:55,500 --> 02:12:57,291
So, my dear audience...

1876
02:12:58,250 --> 02:12:59,791
I end my speech here.

1877
02:13:01,083 --> 02:13:01,916
Mr. Fezi...

1878
02:13:03,958 --> 02:13:05,791
Write in tomorrow's newspaper...

1879
02:13:06,916 --> 02:13:09,458
Gangubai made a speech at Azad Maidan

1880
02:13:10,250 --> 02:13:12,458
not with her eyes downcast,

1881
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,541
but with her head held high!

1882
02:13:15,916 --> 02:13:19,958
Bravo!

1883
02:13:57,208 --> 02:13:58,416
Ms. Gangu.

1884
02:13:59,916 --> 02:14:01,291
Mr. Patil is here.

1885
02:14:02,125 --> 02:14:03,750
He's the local politician.

1886
02:14:05,041 --> 02:14:08,291
I got him after much coaxing.
He was scared to come here.

1887
02:14:09,125 --> 02:14:10,833
Of course he's scared, Fezi.

1888
02:14:11,333 --> 02:14:14,541
When gentlemen like him
visit our brothel, we gain respect

1889
02:14:15,208 --> 02:14:16,416
but they lose theirs.

1890
02:14:19,416 --> 02:14:20,541
Sit down.

1891
02:14:21,583 --> 02:14:24,625
Gangubai, you have a way with words.

1892
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,375
Everyone is talking about your speech.

1893
02:14:27,750 --> 02:14:29,791
And what good will that do?

1894
02:14:30,708 --> 02:14:33,666
I don't want to be talked about, sir.
I want change.

1895
02:14:34,083 --> 02:14:35,041
Birju!

1896
02:14:35,125 --> 02:14:36,833
-Get some sherbet.
-Yes, madam.

1897
02:14:37,166 --> 02:14:38,000
Tell me,

1898
02:14:38,375 --> 02:14:39,541
what can I do for you?

1899
02:14:39,625 --> 02:14:41,666
Elections are around the corner.

1900
02:14:41,958 --> 02:14:43,041
-Kamathipura--
-Birju!

1901
02:14:43,125 --> 02:14:45,500
-Get the green sherbet.
-Yes.

1902
02:14:46,750 --> 02:14:48,250
Not just Kamathipura,

1903
02:14:48,666 --> 02:14:51,541
the stretch from Dongri
to Byculla is your domain.

1904
02:14:51,625 --> 02:14:53,458
Not just Byculla, Mr. Patil.

1905
02:14:53,875 --> 02:14:55,500
She has her hold up to Dharavi!

1906
02:14:57,166 --> 02:14:59,833
Our party is lacking support this time...

1907
02:14:59,916 --> 02:15:01,000
I forgot to ask,

1908
02:15:01,083 --> 02:15:03,791
would you like ice in your drink,
or room temperature is fine?

1909
02:15:03,875 --> 02:15:05,416
Ice.

1910
02:15:05,500 --> 02:15:06,666
Birju!

1911
02:15:06,750 --> 02:15:08,750
Add ice to Mr. Patil's sherbet.

1912
02:15:09,250 --> 02:15:10,541
-Yes, madam.
-Hmm.

1913
02:15:10,625 --> 02:15:14,500
-If you could lend us your support--
-Why?

1914
02:15:15,333 --> 02:15:16,833
What have you done for us?

1915
02:15:17,500 --> 02:15:19,833
You're asking for our votes,

1916
02:15:19,916 --> 02:15:22,750
when thousands of women here
will become homeless

1917
02:15:23,375 --> 02:15:26,125
because of this school's tantrums!

1918
02:15:26,208 --> 02:15:27,208
Gangubai...

1919
02:15:27,958 --> 02:15:30,333
they've escalated
the matter to the Center.

1920
02:15:30,791 --> 02:15:33,291
They've submitted
a petition in Supreme Court.

1921
02:15:33,375 --> 02:15:34,875
We can't do anything now.

1922
02:15:34,958 --> 02:15:37,083
Why the hell isn't the sherbet here yet!

1923
02:15:42,291 --> 02:15:43,250
Mr. Patil,

1924
02:15:43,958 --> 02:15:44,958
forget it!

1925
02:15:45,416 --> 02:15:47,500
What I meant was...

1926
02:15:47,583 --> 02:15:51,250
it now relies on the Supreme Court
or the Prime Minister.

1927
02:15:52,250 --> 02:15:55,333
How can I meet everyone
in the Supreme Court, Fezi?

1928
02:15:56,208 --> 02:15:58,625
Arrange a meeting with the Prime Minister.

1929
02:16:00,333 --> 02:16:01,416
Okay, Mr. Patil.

1930
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:02,958
If you can't do it, I'll--

1931
02:16:03,041 --> 02:16:05,125
No, no, please don't be upset, Gangubai.

1932
02:16:05,541 --> 02:16:07,500
I'll do something, I'll try.

1933
02:16:07,583 --> 02:16:09,958
Help me win this election

1934
02:16:10,291 --> 02:16:12,333
and I'll arrange your trip to Delhi.

1935
02:16:12,791 --> 02:16:14,750
In that case...

1936
02:16:15,125 --> 02:16:17,291
Victory to Mr. Patil!

1937
02:16:18,500 --> 02:16:20,541
Thank you, Gangubai. Thank you.

1938
02:16:20,625 --> 02:16:21,750
I'll leave.

1939
02:16:21,833 --> 02:16:24,291
But you haven't had the sherbet.

1940
02:16:24,375 --> 02:16:26,500
I will, when you're back from Delhi!

1941
02:16:45,250 --> 02:16:46,125
Ms. Gangu...

1942
02:16:46,541 --> 02:16:48,541
I'm glad you're here, Fezi.

1943
02:16:48,750 --> 02:16:51,458
I was wondering what to pack,
a shawl or sweater?

1944
02:16:51,541 --> 02:16:53,000
It's cold in Delhi--

1945
02:16:53,083 --> 02:16:54,583
You won't need it.

1946
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:55,833
Why?

1947
02:16:55,916 --> 02:16:58,208
The Prime Minister
has canceled the meeting.

1948
02:17:02,791 --> 02:17:03,625
Birju!

1949
02:17:03,833 --> 02:17:04,666
Come here.

1950
02:17:05,125 --> 02:17:06,333
Yes, madam?

1951
02:17:06,625 --> 02:17:08,500
Distribute these sweets.

1952
02:17:08,583 --> 02:17:10,708
-But--
-The trip to Delhi is canceled!

1953
02:17:11,708 --> 02:17:13,666
Men should never be trusted.

1954
02:17:13,750 --> 02:17:14,958
I was joking...

1955
02:17:15,458 --> 02:17:17,375
the letter from Delhi just arrived.

1956
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,666
What a terrible joke!

1957
02:17:21,083 --> 02:17:22,833
I was so scared, Fezi.

1958
02:17:22,916 --> 02:17:26,041
I've been worried and anxious
about my Delhi trip.

1959
02:17:26,125 --> 02:17:27,500
Why are you anxious?

1960
02:17:30,083 --> 02:17:31,708
Fezi, 15 years...

1961
02:17:32,625 --> 02:17:35,791
I haven't stepped out
of Kamathipura in 15 years!

1962
02:17:36,291 --> 02:17:37,666
What stopped you?

1963
02:17:40,166 --> 02:17:41,625
A hope...

1964
02:17:43,666 --> 02:17:46,708
that I might meet him
in these lanes someday...

1965
02:17:48,958 --> 02:17:50,375
Ramnik.

1966
02:17:50,583 --> 02:17:53,416
But I hope that you never meet him.

1967
02:17:54,875 --> 02:17:56,791
Because the day you meet him...

1968
02:17:57,833 --> 02:18:00,000
from Gangubai,
you will become Ganga again!

1969
02:18:01,583 --> 02:18:03,708
This fire within you

1970
02:18:04,708 --> 02:18:07,458
that makes you fight
and think for people...

1971
02:18:08,208 --> 02:18:09,458
will get extinguished.

1972
02:18:10,375 --> 02:18:12,666
Forget the past, think of the future.

1973
02:18:13,666 --> 02:18:18,458
The Prime Minister will meet you at 4 pm
in his office, only for 15 minutes.

1974
02:18:20,583 --> 02:18:21,583
That is enough.

1975
02:18:23,208 --> 02:18:28,208
I'll change my name if I don't win
that rose from him in 15 minutes!

1976
02:18:48,708 --> 02:18:49,916
Madam.

1977
02:18:50,583 --> 02:18:52,000
Are you sleeping, madam?

1978
02:18:52,250 --> 02:18:53,083
Yes.

1979
02:18:53,583 --> 02:18:56,541
I can't sleep.
It's my first time traveling by train!

1980
02:18:57,666 --> 02:18:58,875
It's my second time.

1981
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:04,333
The first time, destiny brought me
straight from Kathiawar to Kamathipura.

1982
02:19:05,250 --> 02:19:09,250
And today... I'm headed straight
to the Prime Minister's office!

1983
02:19:09,333 --> 02:19:12,500
Everyone in the neighborhood
will respect us after this.

1984
02:19:13,625 --> 02:19:16,000
I'll show Pappu my photo when we get back.

1985
02:19:16,083 --> 02:19:18,791
Madam! Do get a photo clicked with him,

1986
02:19:18,875 --> 02:19:21,000
or no one will believe we met him.

1987
02:19:30,041 --> 02:19:30,916
Madam.

1988
02:19:31,375 --> 02:19:32,750
Please take your seat.

1989
02:19:32,875 --> 02:19:35,458
-The Prime Minister will be here shortly.
-Yes.

1990
02:19:40,708 --> 02:19:44,041
-Namaste, Gangubai. Please sit.
-Namaste, Mr. Prime Minister.

1991
02:19:48,458 --> 02:19:51,250
-I hope you had a comfortable journey.
-I did.

1992
02:19:52,333 --> 02:19:53,833
-Have some tea.
-Thank you.

1993
02:19:54,125 --> 02:19:56,250
-You have some too?
-Later.

1994
02:19:57,583 --> 02:19:59,125
I've heard a lot about you, Gangubai.

1995
02:20:00,250 --> 02:20:03,166
What you've done for downtrodden
women is commendable.

1996
02:20:03,833 --> 02:20:06,291
Your fight against injustice
is a noble one.

1997
02:20:06,375 --> 02:20:08,333
My father taught me all this.

1998
02:20:08,416 --> 02:20:09,708
He was a barrister too.

1999
02:20:09,958 --> 02:20:11,250
Mr. Jagjeevandas.

2000
02:20:12,125 --> 02:20:14,750
First of all, I want to thank you, sir,

2001
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,333
for taking the time to meet me.

2002
02:20:17,416 --> 02:20:18,750
No need to thank me.

2003
02:20:18,875 --> 02:20:21,583
It's my duty to meet people
and grant them their rights.

2004
02:20:22,041 --> 02:20:23,250
Yes.

2005
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:25,833
That's what I have come for...

2006
02:20:27,375 --> 02:20:28,583
Go on.

2007
02:20:31,250 --> 02:20:33,750
Legalize prostitution!

2008
02:20:35,958 --> 02:20:37,708
That is impossible, Gangubai.

2009
02:20:38,500 --> 02:20:40,875
Prostitution is not
for the welfare of society.

2010
02:20:42,041 --> 02:20:44,875
But as long as society exists,
so will prostitution.

2011
02:20:45,625 --> 02:20:48,125
As we speak,

2012
02:20:48,333 --> 02:20:51,500
some girl is being sold off
or someone is buying her.

2013
02:20:51,958 --> 02:20:54,125
The seller and buyer should be punished,

2014
02:20:54,208 --> 02:20:56,000
but who gets the punishment?

2015
02:20:56,541 --> 02:20:58,000
That innocent girl.

2016
02:21:00,833 --> 02:21:02,500
I can understand your pain.

2017
02:21:02,916 --> 02:21:04,166
No, sir.

2018
02:21:04,458 --> 02:21:08,333
No one can understand what we go through.
Not even God Himself.

2019
02:21:10,875 --> 02:21:13,875
All our rights
have been taken away from us.

2020
02:21:14,458 --> 02:21:16,083
Be it a school or a hospital,

2021
02:21:16,208 --> 02:21:18,166
bank or queue at a grocery store...

2022
02:21:18,541 --> 02:21:20,666
A mother's love, a father's protection,

2023
02:21:20,750 --> 02:21:22,875
we are deprived of it all.

2024
02:21:23,750 --> 02:21:26,958
Now even our home
is being taken away from us.

2025
02:21:27,375 --> 02:21:29,333
They want us to vacate Kamathipura.

2026
02:21:29,500 --> 02:21:32,000
They have even dragged us to court!

2027
02:21:33,416 --> 02:21:35,583
Have faith in the law.

2028
02:21:36,750 --> 02:21:38,208
It always supports the truth.

2029
02:21:38,875 --> 02:21:40,458
Which law?

2030
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,625
We're the victim
and yet treated as a criminal.

2031
02:21:48,708 --> 02:21:50,833
The daughter of Eve needs help.

2032
02:21:52,416 --> 02:21:55,375
The likes of Yashoda,
the daughter of Radha.

2033
02:21:56,625 --> 02:21:59,375
The prophet's nation,
the daughter of Zulekha.

2034
02:22:00,666 --> 02:22:03,291
Those who are proud
of this country, where are they?

2035
02:22:10,541 --> 02:22:11,625
Okay.

2036
02:22:12,125 --> 02:22:14,958
I will set up a committee
and discuss this matter.

2037
02:22:17,208 --> 02:22:18,416
Thank you.

2038
02:22:19,708 --> 02:22:22,166
-Can I ask you something, Gangubai?
-Yes.

2039
02:22:22,250 --> 02:22:24,666
Don't you want
to set up a home of your own,

2040
02:22:24,750 --> 02:22:26,208
away from this world?

2041
02:22:26,291 --> 02:22:30,166
The truth is that the 4,000 women
in Kamathipura are my family.

2042
02:22:30,500 --> 02:22:32,166
I live in their hearts.

2043
02:22:34,750 --> 02:22:35,750
Okay.

2044
02:22:36,208 --> 02:22:38,541
I'll make sure
your homes are not taken away.

2045
02:22:40,291 --> 02:22:42,208
And our legal rights as well...

2046
02:22:54,166 --> 02:22:56,833
Have you ever seen black roses,
Mr. Prime Minister?

2047
02:22:57,750 --> 02:22:58,875
Black roses?

2048
02:22:59,375 --> 02:23:00,458
Do they even exist?

2049
02:23:01,750 --> 02:23:02,666
They do.

2050
02:23:03,666 --> 02:23:05,458
Visit our neighborhood sometime,

2051
02:23:06,125 --> 02:23:08,250
you'll find a garden filled with them.

2052
02:23:17,500 --> 02:23:18,625
Long live India!

2053
02:23:19,208 --> 02:23:20,291
Long live India!

2054
02:23:33,625 --> 02:23:35,875
<i>As long as Gangubai was alive,</i>

2055
02:23:37,125 --> 02:23:39,541
<i>the garden of black roses thrived...</i>

2056
02:23:41,291 --> 02:23:43,041
<i>Gangubai was no saint</i>

2057
02:23:44,041 --> 02:23:45,958
<i>but she was no devil either.</i>

2058
02:23:52,750 --> 02:23:55,833
<i>People like Gangu will not be</i>
<i>mentioned in history,</i>

2059
02:23:58,625 --> 02:24:01,333
<i>but these lanes have a way</i>
<i>of remembering history.</i>

2060
02:24:03,125 --> 02:24:04,666
<i>And these lanes tell us,</i>

2061
02:24:05,916 --> 02:24:10,541
<i>as long as Gangubai lived, not a single</i>
<i>woman in Kamathipura went homeless.</i>

2062
02:24:13,708 --> 02:24:16,750
<i>White sari, a golden tooth,</i>

2063
02:24:18,458 --> 02:24:20,333
<i>and a woman with a golden heart...</i>

2064
02:24:21,916 --> 02:24:24,375
<i>Gangubai Jagjeevandas Kathiawadi.</i>

2065
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:31,708
<i>The woman who tried</i>
<i>to legalize prostitution.</i>

2066
02:24:34,500 --> 02:24:37,208
<i>Who gave women dignity</i>
<i>in an undignified place,</i>

2067
02:24:39,791 --> 02:24:42,833
<i>and taught them to breathe freely</i>
<i>in stifling cages.</i>

2068
02:25:04,958 --> 02:25:07,958
{\an8}<i>The color of gratitude</i>

2069
02:25:08,458 --> 02:25:12,041
{\an8}<i>and celebration that day was white...</i>

2070
02:25:12,333 --> 02:25:13,916
<i>Gangu's white.</i>

2071
02:25:19,333 --> 02:25:22,458
LONG LIVE GANGUBAI

2072
02:25:24,541 --> 02:25:28,500
<i>Some called her a Mafia Queen,</i>
<i>while others called her a sister.</i>

2073
02:25:32,458 --> 02:25:37,125
<i>A friend to someone,</i>
<i>and a mother to some...</i>

2074
02:25:40,458 --> 02:25:43,166
LONG LIVE GANGUBAI

2075
02:27:17,791 --> 02:27:19,000
{\an8}GANGUBAI

2076
02:27:19,083 --> 02:27:22,125
{\an8}<i>Movie stars' posters come</i>
<i>and go every Friday...</i>

2077
02:27:23,375 --> 02:27:25,000
<i>But Gangubai is one such star</i>

2078
02:27:25,166 --> 02:27:28,166
<i>whose photograph</i>
<i>has stayed on the walls of Kamathipura</i>

2079
02:27:28,250 --> 02:27:29,583
<i>for the last 50 years!</i>

2080
02:27:32,500 --> 02:27:34,500
<i>Her destiny was filled with sorrow,</i>

2081
02:27:35,083 --> 02:27:37,291
<i>but she smiled her way through life.</i>

2082
02:27:39,750 --> 02:27:41,375
<i>Wanted to be a movie star,</i>

2083
02:27:42,833 --> 02:27:45,250
<i>but her life played out</i>
<i>like a grand movie!</i>

2084
02:28:44,916 --> 02:28:51,500
<i>Let smiles enjoy</i>

2085
02:28:52,041 --> 02:28:57,708
<i>Coming to you</i>

2086
02:28:58,416 --> 02:29:04,375
<i>Cheer sorrows up</i>

2087
02:29:05,041 --> 02:29:11,375
<i>So they start smiling too</i>

2088
02:29:11,625 --> 02:29:18,250
<i>Let smiles enjoy</i>

2089
02:29:18,625 --> 02:29:24,708
<i>Coming to you</i>

2090
02:29:24,916 --> 02:29:31,083
<i>Cheer sorrows up</i>

<i>So they start smiling too</i>

2092
02:29:38,375 --> 02:29:45,208
<i>Let smiles enjoy...</i>

2093
02:29:59,208 --> 02:30:05,083
<i>Smiles are buried</i>

2094
02:30:05,791 --> 02:30:11,500
<i>Under sadness</i>

2095
02:30:11,625 --> 02:30:18,458
<i>Try moving your lips</i>

2096
02:30:18,541 --> 02:30:23,833
<i>You will find them</i>

2097
02:30:24,916 --> 02:30:29,791
<i>Look at those</i>

2098
02:30:29,875 --> 02:30:36,791
<i>Who wish to show you life</i>

2099
02:30:38,208 --> 02:30:44,666
<i>Cheer sorrows up</i>

2100
02:30:44,958 --> 02:30:51,458
<i>So they start smiling too</i>

2101
02:30:51,666 --> 02:30:58,333
<i>Let smiles enjoy</i>

2102
02:30:58,666 --> 02:31:04,708
<i>Coming to you</i>

2103
02:31:04,958 --> 02:31:11,125

<i>Let smiles enjoy...</i>

2106
02:31:51,708 --> 02:31:56,666
<i>When your heart</i>

2107
02:31:56,750 --> 02:32:03,750
<i>Refuses to smile</i>

2108
02:32:05,125 --> 02:32:11,708
<i>The heart will forget</i>

2109
02:32:12,291 --> 02:32:18,166
<i>How to beat</i>

2110
02:32:18,416 --> 02:32:24,958
<i>Ask your heart to start laughing</i>

2111
02:32:25,041 --> 02:32:31,166
<i>And smiling for no reason</i>

2112
02:32:31,625 --> 02:32:37,875
<i>Cheer sorrows up</i>

2113
02:32:38,333 --> 02:32:44,791
<i>So they start smiling too</i>

2114
02:32:44,875 --> 02:32:51,875
<i>Let smiles enjoy...</i>
