00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:28,790
Anybody there?

3
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:31,665
Where is everyone?

4
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,415
What's the matter?

5
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,374
Who is it?

6
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,790
Who spoke?

7
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,457
Look here. -Where?

8
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,249
Here. Behind you.

9
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,999
Stupid beggar. Look upward now.

10
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,540
Hey, you? -I'm lord Wellington.

11
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,249
Why are you here?

12
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,082
It's a strange city.

13
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,957
People are absent and stones talk.

14
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,415
What are you blabbering?

15
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,040
I'm a reporter.
I came for a scoop.

16
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,832
But where are people of this town?

17
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,040
There is a story behind it.

18
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,374
And it's hero is Prem.

19
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,415
A strange funny fellow
that boy was, Prem.

20
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,165
Come here.

21
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,915
Wipe the crow-shit of my back.

22
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,332
What, sir?

23
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:37,249
Crow has made me dirty.
Wipe it of my back, dumb fellow.

24
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:43,332
Prem and problems are like twins.
Twins.

25
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:48,999
Prem and problems are
always together.

26
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,082
Move back! Move!

27
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,290
Nobody will come in front. Move!

28
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,665
Move! Move!

29
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,999
Move! -Help!

30
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,457
Move! -Move!

31
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,874
Help! Help!

32
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:13,082
Move! -Move! Move!

33
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:59,874
Oh no!

34
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:07,874
What..

35
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,040
Oh my God!

36
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,040
Prem. -President!

37
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,207
Great, Prem! Great.

38
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:37,624
You've caught the dacoit so
bravely. Superb, president!

39
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:38,790
Great work, pal!

40
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,374
I won't spare you.
-You were wonderful, Prem.

41
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,749
I won't spare you.

42
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,540
Great work, Prem!

43
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:53,999
He's a brave fellow.
-Hail President Prem!

44
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,207
Hail! -Shut up!

45
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,582
Don't praise me!

46
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,749
Baldy outsider!

47
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,665
Why are you hiding, baldy?

48
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,999
You again gave me a cycle
without brake.

49
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,415
Thanks to that man..

50
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,957
I ran into him and got
saved or else..

51
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,332
..I'd had an accident. -No.

52
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,749
Hear him?

53
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,540
He ran into the dacoit because
of cycle without brake.

54
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,624
We thought he caught the
dacoit with his bravery.

55
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:20,999
Leave him!

56
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,790
Hello, Prem Shankar Sharma..

57
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,499
..President of Happy
Club speaking.

58
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,457
You want to be a member
of Happy Club.

59
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,999
No, sir. There is a big
demand for membership.

60
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,707
We've 6 months waiting period.

61
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,249
Hello,
you can get it on special case.

62
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,790
Yes, you've to pay only 4999.
-Right.

63
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,624
No cheque only cash. -Correct.

64
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,790
You'll pay next month.

65
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,957
You beggar, don't waste
president's time by calling.

66
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,207
President, we're beggars, not him.

67
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,415
Happy Club has no money.

68
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,915
Even our dads don't pay
us enough money.

69
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,624
Why do we've dads? -Exactly.

70
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,999
Every old dad is enemy
of his young son.

71
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,499
You're my enemy, rogue. -Dad.

72
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,290
Shut up, fool!

73
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,290
Thank God I found all
the rogues together.

74
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,832
I brought these worthless
chaps here. -No, uncle.

75
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,624
We brought this worthless chap
to you to convince you.

76
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,957
At that time you looked
innocent and said..

77
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:33,290
Uncle, we want to start Happy
Club to keep this town happy.

78
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,374
Give us place of 2 coffins.

79
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,665
All five of us will adjust there.

80
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:43,040
And today,
your Happy Club has expanded..

81
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,207
..and my coffin shop has
shrunk to a corner.

82
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,415
Uncle, this is fruits of
our thoughts and deeds.

83
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,582
Which thought and deed?

84
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,124
Close the club! And get lost!

85
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,749
No, uncle. We do good deed.

86
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,832
We protect young girls.

87
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,999
We guide misguided
youths like him.

88
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,290
We unite lovers. -Shut up!

89
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,374
I got many complaints against you.

90
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:10,040
Now your dirty club can't
run in my shop.

91
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,040
Uncle..-No, no.

92
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,415
This is uncle's place
and he'll decide it.

93
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,832
You're too good. Just great!

94
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,832
You're justice. You're king.

95
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,207
You're wise. You're pope.

96
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,082
Now you'll decide whose work
is dirty. Yours or ours?

97
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,415
Meaning?

98
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,082
Uncle, happy wants people
to be healthy and happy.

99
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,499
And you want them to die
and rest in your coffin.

100
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:38,832
Who work is dirty?

101
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,915
Think before you answer.
Your God is watching.

102
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,915
By the way, uncle, membership
to our club is open. -But..

103
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,707
50 percent off to old people.
-Listen..

104
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,999
Only 2999. -But..

105
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,915
Uncle,
we take only cash, not cheques.

106
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,624
David,
your dad has become a member.

107
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,415
Hug him. -Dad!

108
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,499
President, you've saved the club.

109
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,832
Now save this Romeo too who
is in love with his Juliet.

110
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,540
Chandar, tell me. What's love?

111
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,957
You say you get lost
in her thought.

112
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,374
Where do you get lost?
How do you return?

113
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:15,957
Laugh as much as you want.

114
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,207
You'll realize when you'll
fall in love.

115
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,582
Come on, pal. You're getting
serious? -Obviously.

116
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,540
I was shouting for
long to help me.

117
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,207
If I don't get Divya tomorrow,
I won't get her ever.

118
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,874
And I'll commit suicide.

119
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,582
Don't worry, Chandar.
You're member of Happy club.

120
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,957
And it's our rule to unite lovers.
-Right, friends? -Right.

121
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,040
But friend,
you've to pay wedding expenses.

122
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,040
I'll pay.
-Commission of Happy club too.

123
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,415
I'll pay that too. -Listen.

124
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,749
I can see that your love is true.

125
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,207
But do you've evidence or letter..

126
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,040
..to prove that her love is true.

127
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,915
I've her lots of letters.

128
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,457
She write to me new letter daily.
This is latest.

129
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,332
Lucky boy.

130
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:54,749
It's blank.

131
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,499
Love doesn't need words.

132
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,249
Feelings. Only feelings.

133
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,457
Kunu, why did you park
the vehicle so far?

134
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,999
I told him. I can't go close.

135
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,749
There are 4 woman like gents
bodyguards. -What?

136
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,082
I mean there are 4 men like ladies
bodyguards around Devi.

137
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,915
They're very dangerous.
Once they thrashed me brutally.

138
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,999
You fool,
how will we recognize her?

139
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,665
I've brought it.

140
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,540
Will you celebrate honeymoon
with binoculars?

141
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,290
Tell me.

142
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,624
There she's.
Near book shop in yellow dress. '

143
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,082
Is she your love?
-What do you mean?

144
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,790
Does she really love you?

145
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,915
Yes, friend. Didn't I tell you
about those love letters?

146
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,165
Yes, those of feelings? -Yes.

147
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:38,749
I can't believe it.

148
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,457
President, let me see too.

149
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,082
Near the book stall
in yellow dress.

150
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:54,832
Oh! So are marrying her?
Are you mad?

151
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,749
She has gone mad to elope
with his pauper.

152
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,457
She'll elope with her.
But is he mad to marry her?

153
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:06,165
Fool, you're pitying him and
I feel sorry for her.

154
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,332
What are you saying?

155
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,290
If you don't kidnap Devi today,
we won't get another chance.

156
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,374
Look, no guard is around.
Hurry up! -Yes, we're going.

157
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,707
Did you explain to her that
we'll come to kidnap her?

158
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:16,832
Yes.

159
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,124
Let's go. -Hold this.

160
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,790
Listen, code word is 'Are
you coming to Khandala?'

161
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,415
President, she's a bit angry
with me. Handle her.

162
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,665
As Chandar has said,
guards aren't around.

163
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,415
It's a good chance.
-Go from there.

164
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,832
Tell her the codeword and kidnap
her. I'll come be there.

165
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,332
Yes, President. -Over and out.

166
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,040
Are you coming to Khandala?

167
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,374
If you pay 3000,
I'll come anywhere.

168
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:00,290
President, do you've 2000 rupees?
-Why?

169
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,915
I've 1 000.
Chandar is saving money.

170
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:07,290
Devi says she'll come if we pay
3000. -What are you saying?

171
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,290
Yes, look there. She's ready.

172
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,207
Fool, whom did you approach?

173
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,540
Devi.

174
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,415
She's not Devi, Devi is here.
Sit in van, I'll get Devi.

175
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,332
I've been here 5 times,
Mr. Daruwala.

176
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,999
If you can't arrange puppies,
please return my advance.

177
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:30,374
Madam,
consider that we got the puppies.

178
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,457
They're in demand now.

179
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,832
Manager has kept them with him
so that nobody takes them.

180
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,832
I don't know where he's.
I'll check and call him.

181
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,874
Are you coming to Khandala?

182
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,624
Khandala? -Yes.

183
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,165
Do I've to come to Khandala
for that dog?

184
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,374
Dog?

185
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:58,457
Look, madam. I know you're angry,
but don't call him dog.

186
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,915
Ok. Not dog, puppy. -Puppy?

187
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,332
Ok, call him puppy. He's yours.

188
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,957
Where is he? -In the van.

189
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,040
Let's go. -Come.

190
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:13,999
How many nails he has?

191
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,999
Ten.

192
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,374
Not you, but that dog. -What?

193
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,332
Sorry, puppy.

194
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,999
Puppy's nails.
-It must be 1 9 or 21 .

195
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,332
1 0 of hands and 1 0 of legs.
Look, he definitely has 20.

196
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:32,207
Oh! Listen to me. I'll pick him
by his ear and check him.

197
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,415
What?

198
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,582
Call him puppy or dog, he's yours.

199
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,332
You can lift him as you want.

200
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,707
Wait. I'll get him.

201
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:45,874
He's bringing her.

202
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,207
Dog..-What are you saying?

203
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,624
She said that.

204
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,124
She's very angry with you.

205
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,415
She said she'll lift you by
ears and check you. -What?

206
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,415
It's very tense situation. Come.

207
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,999
Devi. Devi.

208
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,290
Where are you going?
She's Devi, puppy.

209
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,582
What nonsense!

210
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,790
Whom did you kidnap?

211
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,332
Kidnap? What did you mean?

212
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,999
She isn't your girl? -No.

213
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,624
Very good. -What good?

214
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,207
No, our Happy club has erred.

215
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,290
We came to kidnap a girl..-Kidnap?

216
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,499
You mean kidnapping? -No.

217
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,332
Kidnappers! Police!

218
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,082
What a girl, pal!

219
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,374
Silky hair, milky cheeks.
She's like a vanilla ice-cream.

220
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,665
What are you doing, President?
Look, my Devi is leaving.

221
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,915
Those guards are with her.

222
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,499
She went in the mall.
What will we do now?

223
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:39,832
Don't worry. I've plan B
to make Devi your wife.

224
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,040
Oh God! How dare you tease a girl!

225
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,999
You fool!

226
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,124
Dear, this colour will suit you.

227
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,332
'Are you coming to Khandala?' -Ok.

228
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,499
What happened? What's this sound?

229
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,790
Devi was here.
-How did this Pathan came here?

230
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,082
I'm scared.

231
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:16,082
Hey, you're Pathan's wife,
yet you're scared.

232
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,290
Small wife. Fat wife. Let's go.

233
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:24,249
Where is Devi? -Nobody will leave.
We'll check everyone.

234
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,332
Oh! Disgusting!

235
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:32,582
You stupid man! I don't know
if you're a man or a woman.

236
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,582
You want to see the
face of wife of..

237
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,082
..Sultan Salman Shahrukh
Khan Tublak.

238
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,207
You want to see face
of Pathan's wife.

239
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,124
Even I didn't see it clearly
and you want to see it.

240
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,290
Wait. I'll call my brother Asama.

241
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,165
He'll blast bomb on your head.

242
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,540
Brother..-No. You can go.

243
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,124
My dear wife! Let's go.

244
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,915
That's Devi. Nab her.

245
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,540
Let's run!

246
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,665
Run!

247
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,582
Hurry!

248
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:48,374
This encounter king has killed 98.
Terror Tej Singh.

249
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,999
I'll complete my century
if I find..

250
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,790
..Devi and her husband by evening.

251
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:57,040
And if I don't find,
I'll get four.

252
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,999
I'll kill four of you.

253
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,165
Now garland each other.

254
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,457
Thank you.

255
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,040
Wedding is complete.

256
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:12,582
Don't worry. Terror Tej Singh
won't find us. Let's eat food.

257
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,999
We've no money.
-Don't worry. We'll eat for free.

258
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,332
Again? Here?

259
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,207
You've come again. -Talk with
respect. President is here.

260
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,415
You're talking as if you're
country's President.

261
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,207
We'll become that too one day.

262
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,624
Don't talk too much.

263
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,332
Take the order.

264
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,790
Bring 4 grilled chicken.

265
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,790
2 fried brains. -One mutton gravy.

266
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,249
One kebab.

267
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,374
Again the same.

268
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,957
I told you to eat vegetarian
food when with me.

269
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,415
I detest smell of chicken
and mutton.

270
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,665
Mr. President,
majority is of non-veg.

271
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,624
Yes. -Eat it. You'll be sinned.

272
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,957
Get cottage cheese and
fried lentils for me.

273
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,165
Pay 1 350 rupees. -What?

274
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,832
You want money in advance?
What's this rule?

275
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,124
It's a good rule for free
loaders like you.

276
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:00,124
Actually, dad.
Today we're in tight spot.

277
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,249
We're father and son at home,
not here.

278
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,582
Ok, Shiv Shankar.

279
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,040
Shameless,
you take my father's name.

280
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,374
I can't call you papa or take
your name. What should I say?

281
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,624
Don't say anything. Pay the money.

282
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,832
David, give the key. -But, dad..

283
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,290
Your dad is a great man,
like an angel.

284
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,457
Yes, I'm a demon.

285
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:24,457
The car is worth 8 lakh.
Tomorrow I'll pay and take car.

286
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,665
Ok. -Give them food.

287
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,499
Fresh, don't give me yesterday's
stale food.

288
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,999
Don't give me the look.
Bring the food.

289
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,040
He fooled me again.

290
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:47,165
He ate for free and left
with the van. Cheater!

291
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,582
I've tolerated him a lot.
It's enough now.

292
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,082
We can't stay in the
same house together.

293
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,165
No, dad. Please don't say that.

294
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,915
I won't change my decision now.

295
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,957
If not for me,
don't do this for mother.

296
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,165
Not for anyone.

297
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,249
Sharda, tell him.
I won't change my decision.

298
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,040
Papa, please. I beg of you.

299
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,790
No matter what you do,
my decision is final.

300
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,374
We can't stay together.

301
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,207
But where will you go in this age?

302
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,415
You'll wander around?

303
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,415
Neither your old bones nor
your voice is strong.

304
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,165
You can't even beg properly.

305
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,207
"Madam." one has to
shout like this.

306
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,499
Shut up!

307
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,832
I'm talking about you, not me.

308
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,665
It's more shameful for you.

309
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,540
What will people say? -What?

310
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,207
That a young boy is
enjoying outside..

311
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,665
..leaving old parents
alone at home.

312
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,499
You can't enjoy.
One needs cash to enjoy.

313
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,624
Worthless, you can't earn a penny.

314
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,999
It's better to be without a son
than have a son like you.

315
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,665
Papa, you're insulting sons.

316
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:52,332
Don't forget that only sons
have earned fame, not dads.

317
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,665
What this new rubbish!

318
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,165
Mr. Gandhi. -Mr. Gandhi?

319
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,790
Mahatma. Real He-man.

320
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,415
He drove British out with a cane.

321
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,082
Do you know his father's name?

322
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,290
Mr. Shastri. Lal Bahadur.

323
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,749
He was small but he did great
work and became Prime Minister.

324
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,415
Have you heard his father's name?

325
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,415
Michael Jackson.
Entire world dances on his steps.

326
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,457
Have you heard his father's name?

327
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,040
Hello, look at me.

328
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:20,124
Prem Shankar Sharma.
President of Happy Club.

329
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,832
What does his father do?

330
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,165
He works hard to earn money.

331
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,040
He isn't a free loader like you.

332
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,832
Cool. -Cool, my foot! Fool!

333
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,665
You gave you studies and work.

334
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,665
Why don't you leave the house now?

335
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,624
Don't give me the look. Get out.

336
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,290
What are you doing?
He's young..-Quiet!

337
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,040
Your pampering has ruined him!

338
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,249
Get inside.

339
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,207
And you go out.

340
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,499
Come home, son.

341
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,790
No, mother.

342
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,999
Don't mind your father.

343
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,207
Prem. Prem.

344
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:28,249
Mo, because of me you too
get scolded by dad.

345
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,415
His intentions are right.

346
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:33,665
He just care for you.

347
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:35,749
I know.

348
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:41,832
He worries what I'll do in life.

349
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:45,624
On top of that sometimes
I stammer too.

350
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:50,540
Who says you stammer? You just
take pauses while talking.

351
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,665
That's called stammering, mother.

352
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:08,249
Only when you get emotional,
you've difficulty talking.

353
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,749
You're very good, mother.

354
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:21,082
Look, some day for you, I'll..

355
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:25,915
..only for you,
I'll do something to get..

356
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,457
..my photo published
in front page.

357
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:33,415
Then you and dad will be happy.

358
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:39,415
Now I've to work to earn money
to get my respect back.

359
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,457
I've been telling you to find
a tenant for my uncle's flat.

360
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:45,665
We'll get commission.
-That Heaven Apartment.

361
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,499
Third class flat of second class
building? -Nobody will rent it.

362
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,665
We'll find some fool.
-What if we don't find one?

363
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,832
We'll fool someone.

364
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:58,790
Come, uncle Pinto.
This is your luxurious flat.

365
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,415
My flat.
I didn't even see it properly.

366
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,790
Then look. Window!

367
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:09,207
Spacious. Comfortable. You
won't find such a flat.

368
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:11,249
Isn't it first class.
-First class.

369
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:16,624
This is first class, Raju.
Only a fool won't like it.

370
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,165
How did you like it, uncle?

371
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,082
It's good.

372
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,249
Heard? He has chosen it.

373
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,624
Pinto, you liked this flat?

374
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,415
Why? Isn't it first class?

375
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:44,790
Only a fool won't like this flat.

376
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,124
How did you like it?

377
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:49,457
It's good,
but..-Even madam likes it.

378
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:51,790
Give our commission. 1 0,000.

379
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,165
But we fixed 6000.

380
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,540
Yes, 6000 for flat and 4000 to
become member of Happy club.

381
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,040
When did you say so? -Now.

382
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,790
No. We don't want to be a member.

383
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:07,832
Fool! If you want to be happy
here, you've to become a member.

384
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:09,374
What's going on, dad?

385
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:13,790
You? -She's that girl!

386
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:16,707
How did they get in?
Dad, they're kidnappers.

387
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:18,040
Kidnappers! -No.

388
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:20,040
That day they came to kidnap
a girl in mall.

389
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,249
That girl wanted to be kidnapped?
-Nonsense.

390
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:25,040
Pinto, drive him out quickly.

391
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:27,249
Give us our money. We'll leave.

392
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:28,915
Don't give him any money.

393
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,457
We won't leave without
taking the money.

394
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:32,374
He won't listen like this.

395
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,874
We won't listen even that way.

396
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:35,207
Why won't you listen.

397
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:38,582
Munna is getting the luggage.
He'll talk to you. Call him.

398
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:40,457
Munna!

399
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:41,582
Munna is coming.

400
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,999
What's going on?

401
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:47,207
Who are you?
Why are you standing on stool?

402
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,790
I'm Munna Raja.

403
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:54,165
Don't be scared. -They left.

404
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,415
What? -They left.

405
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,165
Problem?

406
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:04,082
Sound.

407
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:07,290
No problem.
I couldn't understand them.

408
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:10,540
Now that you're here,
I understood them.

409
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:16,040
Good afternoon, madam.
This is your lovely puppy.

410
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:19,832
I wanted to give this on your
birthday. He's getting it now.

411
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:21,957
This is your wedding gift.

412
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,790
Thank you.

413
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,040
Sandra. -Bye, Jenny. -Bye.

414
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:29,332
Sorry, madam.

415
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,290
I'd have brought it,
but I'm being harassed by police.

416
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:34,582
Why?

417
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:40,124
The day you came,
some boys kidnapped a woman.

418
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:44,207
Do you know whose wife she was?
Of Terror Tej Singh.

419
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,915
Those boys fled with the wife.

420
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,415
Now Terror Tej Sing
is harassing us.

421
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,415
I know them.
Call Tej Singh to Church.

422
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:11,707
"We've come to you with
my lonely heart.."

423
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,124
Run! Run!

424
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:22,207
Lakhan! Get lost!

425
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:29,790
Wait! Why are we running?

426
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,707
Terror Tej Singh.
-Tell us while running.

427
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:35,040
Tej Singh is coming. Run quickly.

428
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:36,957
But how did he come
to know about us?

429
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:41,374
Jenny has called him here
to take revenge with us.

430
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:46,457
Wait. Wait. -Why?

431
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,040
We came back to the place
from where we started.

432
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,999
Where did you go?

433
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:54,040
We ran to live, but now we'll die.

434
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,290
He came to kill us.

435
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,707
Is the information right?
-Yes, she called us at the church.

436
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:01,249
She has come too. -Who?

437
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:12,082
Daruwala, Church is here.
Did she call us here? -Yes.

438
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:13,999
She must be on her way.
Let's ask them.

439
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,374
Hi. -Hi. She came.

440
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:17,540
She's madam Jenny.

441
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:22,040
She knows the boys who
kidnapped your Devi.

442
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:23,915
Who are they? -They.

443
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,540
They..-No,
they're good boys from Happy Club.

444
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,082
They help others.

445
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,999
I'll find the boys
with their help.

446
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:35,999
Daruwala, you said the girl
knows their address.

447
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:37,499
I did. -When did I say so?

448
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:40,582
You didn't.
Come. -Sir, she said it.

449
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:46,082
Jenny. Jenny.

450
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,332
President.

451
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:59,374
What are you doing here?
Terror Tej Singh just left.

452
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:01,999
We know. Jenny had called him.

453
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:04,290
But we met Jenny and
told her the truth.

454
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:05,957
She's Devi.

455
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,749
Prem kidnapped her that day to
save her from Terror Tej Singh.

456
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:13,707
That butcher used to keep her
forcefully and hit her.

457
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:18,040
But we love each other,
so Prem got us married.

458
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:22,665
Now if you want, I can take
her back to that butcher.

459
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:25,999
But please don't get
Prem arrested.

460
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:28,665
Thank you, friend. -Come on.

461
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:31,082
Not even our relatives do
what you did for me.

462
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,290
We're going to Goa.
We'll settle there.

463
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:35,832
Take care of Devi.

464
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,165
Oh sorry, uncle Pinto.

465
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:51,332
Why did you come here?
-To thanks Jenny for helping us.

466
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,332
Jenny made a mistake. Forgive us.

467
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,624
It's all your fault, Jenny.

468
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,249
Meaning?

469
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:11,207
Today that rogue came to
our door with flowers.

470
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:14,665
Listen, tomorrow he'll enter
the house through the pipes.

471
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:20,499
Mother, what is my mistake?
I didn't know.

472
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,124
I didn't call him.

473
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:25,749
You'd a good chance to
get that boy arrested.

474
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:27,832
He acts like a President.

475
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:30,165
Darn Happy club!

476
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,082
But dad, he helped that girl.

477
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:37,082
He's a good guy.

478
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,540
Heard, Pinto?

479
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:42,749
That rogue and cheat
who insulted us..

480
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:45,207
..has become dearer to her today.

481
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:50,040
And we're strangers.
She arguing with us for him.

482
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:53,082
Would she've done it if
she were our blood.

483
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,999
Bloody orphan!

484
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,582
Mom, why do you always say so?

485
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,582
You're my parents.
Monty and Daisy are my siblings.

486
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,999
Instead of raising her,
you should've raised a dog.

487
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,290
At least it would've
been loyal to you.

488
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:25,374
Dad.

489
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,457
You really scared us in
front of Tej Singh.

490
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,249
You know we almost had
a heart attack.

491
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,207
Anyway, it was a nice revenge.

492
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:07,040
Oh! -Happy Club.

493
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:14,624
At least we became
friends this way.

494
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:16,082
When?

495
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,165
Why? We aren't friends.

496
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:20,707
We'll become friends.

497
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:25,082
But I'm scared as you might
play any prank on me.

498
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:27,415
Yes, we do that.

499
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:31,040
Honestly,
if we'd known your problem..

500
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:32,999
..we wouldn't have done so.

501
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:35,832
My problem? -That you're orphan.

502
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:38,707
Who said this to you?

503
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,540
When I came last night with
flowers I heard Miss. Pinto..

504
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:43,707
She's my mother.

505
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:49,040
We're a family.

506
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:59,082
I don't even remember the faces..

507
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:04,790
..of those who gave me birth.

508
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:09,040
I'm sorry.

509
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:16,249
I'm stammering..but it's true.

510
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:25,082
Is blood relationship everything?

511
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:32,040
If I too..

512
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:35,082
..don't consider them my own..

513
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:41,624
..then how can I live?

514
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:43,624
Tell me, Prem.

515
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,082
I'm sorry, Jenny.
I didn't mean to..

516
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:57,207
You're mocking me? -No.

517
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,165
No. I'm..

518
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:03,374
I hate you.

519
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:20,499
"Please wait. Listen to me!"

520
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:26,874
"My heart says to you.."

521
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:32,499
"..don't punish me for no reason."

522
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:43,540
"Don't away from me getting
cross forgetting the love."

523
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:53,499
"Come to me, my desire."

524
00:34:55,166 --> 00:35:00,290
"May we never be separated."

525
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:05,249
"Come and be a part of me."

526
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:24,415
"All the time I miss you."

527
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:29,707
"Where is life taking me along?"

528
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,999
"I'm totally lost in love."

529
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:40,415
"Unseen and unheard feelings
are aroused."

530
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:44,540
"This had never happened to me."

531
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:50,999
"Believe my love today."

532
00:35:51,291 --> 00:36:01,540
"Come to me, my desire."

533
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:07,665
"May we never be separated."

534
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:12,749
"Come and be a part of me."

535
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:20,415
That fatso Mrs. Pinto
came to inn..

536
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:22,915
..with her dwarf husband.

537
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:26,665
She insulted me publicly
because of you.

538
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:28,499
You went to meet her with flowers?

539
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,665
No, dad. Are you crazy?
Will I take flowers for her?

540
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:33,999
I went with flowers for
her daughter Jenny.

541
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:38,415
Shameless! You climb pipes
to woo girls with flowers.

542
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:42,582
No, dad. I took flowers for
Jenny to thanks her.

543
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,540
You got flowers!

544
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:47,790
Why do you thank in a way that
people come to abuse me?

545
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:51,499
I'm ashamed even to walk with you.
Give it to me.

546
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:53,040
I feel like slapping you.

547
00:36:56,125 --> 00:37:00,207
Then slap me. Where are you going?

548
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:05,832
Jenny slapped on one cheek.
You slap on the other.

549
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:07,874
He wants to slap me.

550
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:10,957
What?

551
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:13,499
Get lost.

552
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:21,165
What did I do now?

553
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:23,624
You too? -What?

554
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:27,957
You stammer like me.

555
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:32,624
Yes, only when I'm upset..

556
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:38,624
I'm so sorry.
That day I didn't know.

557
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:40,915
I thought..

558
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:43,415
Come on. You slap me today.

559
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:46,582
No, I can't do this.

560
00:37:46,666 --> 00:37:49,832
Please slap me just once.
I'll feel better.

561
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,374
But how can I, Jenny? No.

562
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:55,207
If you don't listen to me,
I'll get angry again.

563
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:02,082
Jenny, tell me something else.
I'll do it.

564
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:03,832
Promise? -Yes.

565
00:38:04,791 --> 00:38:06,374
But don't tell me anything
difficult.

566
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:11,540
Then treat me to spicy fitters
and mint sauce.

567
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,165
Ok. Ok.

568
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,207
Come. Come,
Jenny. Welcome to Happy Club.

569
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,332
Don't be sorry for past, don't
worry for future. -Be happy today.

570
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,165
This is the rule of our Happy
Club. Right, friends? -Yes.

571
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:43,624
I envy you. -Thank you.

572
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:45,207
What did it mean?

573
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:52,332
It means..No.

574
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,207
It means I wish I were like you.

575
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:59,832
You've become like us.
Now you're a member of Happy Club.

576
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:01,249
That too, for free.

577
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,665
And we all are of one colour.
Happy colour.

578
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:05,915
And this club will always
keep you Happy.

579
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:07,165
Right.

580
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:10,415
Thanks. It's a great place.

581
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:13,207
What's this?

582
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:16,790
Something is fishy.

583
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,624
No, it's me. Look at my face.

584
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:23,915
Yes, but body is of Salman Khan.

585
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,999
No, it's mine. I clicked it here.

586
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:30,374
Prem, I'm Salman's fan.
I've his many photos.

587
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:31,832
Maybe this one too.

588
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,165
This one is mine.
I can understand your problem.

589
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:38,290
Actually our bodies are same.

590
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:39,999
I'd trained him.

591
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:47,374
Jenny,
I'd double flu two months ago.

592
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,332
Jaundice and malaria.
So the body has squeezed a little.

593
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,457
It'll become like Sallu
in 2-3 months.

594
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:57,124
Sallu. You really know Salman?

595
00:39:58,125 --> 00:39:59,165
Do I know him?

596
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:03,124
He'll be Salman Khan for you.
But he's my friend.

597
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:04,415
I can't believe it.

598
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,165
Look, she doesn't believe me.

599
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,624
She recognized you quickly.

600
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,082
It took us years. -Shut up!

601
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:10,790
They all are kidding.

602
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,165
Prem, introduce me to Salman once.

603
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,207
I'll take you to his house.

604
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:18,665
I'll say, my friend Jenny is here.
Serve her pilaf.

605
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,040
That will be the best
day of my life.

606
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:24,124
Really?
Phone Sallu, I'll talk to him now.

607
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:25,874
Let it be.
He'll be busy in shooting.

608
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:34,040
So many books.

609
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:37,124
You aren't allowed to shout here.

610
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:40,582
So many books?
Does anyone read them?

611
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:42,749
It's written to be read.

612
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:47,082
What will he do by reading it?

613
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:53,124
Why did you come here?

614
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:57,082
Actually I was passing by.
So I thought of meeting you.

615
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,040
Jenny, how do you work here?

616
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:02,624
Don't you feel suffocated?

617
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,415
In fact I like it here.
I feel safe.

618
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:08,707
All my books here are my friends.

619
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:10,665
Friends?

620
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:13,999
Yes.
Books are best friends of humans.

621
00:41:14,416 --> 00:41:15,582
They're always with us.

622
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:20,082
They neither demand nor complain.
They just support us.

623
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:21,957
Just like me.

624
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:24,540
Really? You too will support me?

625
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:28,249
Always, Jenny.
No complaints, no demand.

626
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:36,957
You're mad. -Thank you.

627
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:39,999
You're funny. -Thank you, Jenny.

628
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,874
What happened?
-Salman Khan has come.

629
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:46,749
Salman!

630
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:53,624
God, how did he come here?

631
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,332
Prem, your friend Salman is here.
Prem.

632
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:02,415
Come, Prem. -Yes, Jenny.

633
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:05,207
Please introduce me to him.
Please.

634
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:08,040
Yes. Why not? Sure. -Then come.

635
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:11,124
Jenny, we can't meet him in this
crowd. We'll go to his house.

636
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:14,582
God knows when we'll get a chance.
He's here so call him.

637
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:15,915
Really? -Yes.

638
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:22,082
Sallu. Sallu!

639
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:23,874
Sallu!

640
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:28,999
Who called me Sallu? I'll see.

641
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:32,957
He's coming. He's coming.

642
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:36,832
He's coming.

643
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:53,790
Who called me Sallu?

644
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:56,124
Your friend.

645
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:59,999
Friend? Let me see my friend.

646
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,999
I've seen this face
for the first time.

647
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:11,332
Sallu, I didn't come home
once, so you're so angry.

648
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:14,207
Hey, when did you come home?

649
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,832
Don't be angry, Sallu.
I'll come home to eat pilaf.

650
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:21,582
Forget home,
even if I see you on road..

651
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:24,790
..I'll change the design
of your face.

652
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:27,665
Did you see our friendship?

653
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,415
Jenny, go and get autograph book.
-Ok.

654
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,082
This will go on. -One minute. -Go.

655
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:37,332
Brother Salman, sorry. Actually
I like Jenny very much. -Oh!

656
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:39,540
And Jenny likes you.
She's your fan.

657
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:43,207
Ok. -I lied that you're my
friend to impress her.

658
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:44,832
What else did you say to her?

659
00:43:44,916 --> 00:43:47,124
That I taught to body building.

660
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,040
Prem.

661
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:54,207
Your thighs are loose, Sallu.
Don't you do what I taught you?

662
00:43:54,416 --> 00:43:57,915
I'll do that too. Won't you
introduce your friend to me.

663
00:43:58,291 --> 00:44:00,999
Yes. Jenny, Salman Khan.

664
00:44:01,083 --> 00:44:03,040
You're so scared as if
you're introducing..

665
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,540
..my girlfriend as yours.

666
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,874
Did you see?
He's mad and funny like me.

667
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,624
Jenny!

668
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:14,040
Jennifer, he's my good friend.

669
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:17,374
Such friends are rare.
Don't lose him.

670
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:20,124
Take this.

671
00:44:20,916 --> 00:44:26,374
Listen, come home with Jenny
to eat pilaf. Bye.

672
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,915
You're very good. I like you.

673
00:44:33,166 --> 00:44:35,582
My God! Oh my God!

674
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:38,707
'You're very good. I like you.'

675
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:40,790
'You're very good.'

676
00:44:41,375 --> 00:45:05,415
You're very good. I like you.

677
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:07,832
Did you say something?

678
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,457
You're very good. I like you.

679
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:13,749
Thank you, son.

680
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:18,040
You're very good. I like you.

681
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:20,165
You started in the morning.
Our son will hear you.

682
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,915
Our son has said that.

683
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,415
He told me I'm very good.

684
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,957
What? -Yes. You can ask him.

685
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:32,124
You're very good. I like you.

686
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:34,582
Naughty!

687
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,040
Tell Jenny how you feel
as soon as possible.

688
00:45:41,708 --> 00:45:45,832
No, it will be dangerous.
What if she refuses?

689
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:49,249
I'll be heart-broken.

690
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,790
She might say yes too. -Yes.

691
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:56,999
It's more dangerous. What if my
heart fails because of joy?

692
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:40,082
"Come in my dreams and steal
my sleep, damsel."

693
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:47,374
"Charm me and steal my heart."

694
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:54,749
"I see you wherever I look."

695
00:46:55,500 --> 00:47:09,707
"Take my love saga to its
destination, it's up to you."

696
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:35,124
"I've been waiting for
long for love."

697
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:41,999
"What can I do to make you mine?"

698
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:49,665
"Should I use magic to
show my love to you?"

699
00:47:50,041 --> 00:48:04,290
"Take my love saga to its
destination, it's up to you."

700
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:33,040
"How should I tell you
how I feel about you?"

701
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:40,165
"It's time we exchange
our hearts."

702
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:47,999
"I can in a dilemma how to
express my feelings."

703
00:48:48,208 --> 00:49:02,624
"Take my love saga to its
destination, it's up to you."

704
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:09,332
You're no match for Jenny.

705
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,332
She's a graduate and you failed in
ninth grade. -She has a class..

706
00:49:13,416 --> 00:49:14,707
..but you don't.

707
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:16,207
Friends, what are you saying?

708
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:19,415
You're vegetarian and she's
non- Vegetarian .

709
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:25,374
What? -Chicken,
mutton, she eats everything. -Oh!

710
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:27,249
She even eats trotters.

711
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:31,332
You can't even hear it,
but she relishes on it.

712
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:34,082
Tell me, how can you two unite?

713
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:35,207
Tell us.

714
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,290
You can do it.

715
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:38,582
Hurry up!

716
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:41,124
Yes, that's more like it.

717
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:44,249
Wow! Great Kebab!

718
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,374
This is very tasty. Eat it.

719
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:47,999
It's raw. Tell him to cook more.

720
00:49:48,416 --> 00:49:51,165
It will melt if he cooks more.
Eat it.

721
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,499
It's tasty. Very tasty.

722
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:06,207
I told you, man.

723
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:09,165
That's why my Jenny likes it.

724
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:11,332
Oh God!

725
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:18,415
Sharda, don't let his hand
light my funeral pyre.

726
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:20,999
It's holding a chicken leg.

727
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:23,832
Don't say that.
It's made even in your hotel.

728
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:26,540
Business and religion
are separate.

729
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:30,540
This fool was idle!
Now he's defiled too.

730
00:50:30,666 --> 00:50:31,874
Oh God!

731
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:00,665
Good evening, Jesus.

732
00:51:02,291 --> 00:51:06,582
I'm Prem Shankar Sharma.
I came for first time here.

733
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,915
You're Jenny's God. My God..

734
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:14,790
..is Lord Shiva in the
temple at the corner.

735
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:19,624
You know Bholenath.
Ask him. I go there daily.

736
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:26,540
Jesus,
for Jenny I'm eating mutton.

737
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:30,249
I've desecrated my religion.

738
00:51:32,916 --> 00:51:36,374
Bholenath is angry.
I can't go there.

739
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:40,165
You know,
Bholenath has three eyes.

740
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,082
If he opens his third eyes,
I'll be finished.

741
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:56,207
Jesus, I like Jenny. I love Jenny.

742
00:51:57,875 --> 00:52:00,374
If you help me, I can marry Jenny.

743
00:52:02,083 --> 00:52:03,124
Please help.

744
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:07,082
Jenny is beautiful and classy.

745
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:12,582
I've no class. Poor fellow.

746
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:18,957
If you don't help me,
who will help, Jesus? Please help.

747
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,707
Somehow fix me in Jenny's heart.

748
00:52:27,583 --> 00:52:30,874
Fix it permanently. I thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

749
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,707
Jenny darling, I can't live
without you. It's a cliché.

750
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:39,332
I love you. It's out date too.

751
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:43,165
Jenny, I like you a lot. Correct.

752
00:52:43,541 --> 00:52:46,665
Jenny, I like you a lot.
Will you marry me? Oh no!

753
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:49,249
Jenny, I like you a lot.

754
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,832
I'll always keep you happy.
Correct.

755
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,832
Jenny, I like you a lot.
I'll always keep you happy.

756
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,124
Practicing to say I love you.
-Yes.

757
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,582
Even I'd practiced here a lot.

758
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:08,124
I waited so much that
I became a waiter.

759
00:53:10,166 --> 00:53:13,040
That fool broke my rhythm.
So what was I saying?

760
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:15,707
Jenny, I like you a lot.

761
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:19,082
I'll happy keep you happy.
Will you be my life partner.

762
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:22,374
First class.
-Happy birthday, Prem.

763
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:23,915
Oh! Happy birthday.

764
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:25,707
It's your birthday.

765
00:53:25,791 --> 00:53:27,332
Yes. Thank you.

766
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:28,874
Where are your friends?

767
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:30,415
They..-Happy Club. -They'll come.

768
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,207
Let's sit and talk.

769
00:53:34,083 --> 00:53:35,124
Thanks.

770
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:38,832
You were saying that you wanted
to say something to me.

771
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:40,915
Yes, actually Jenny..

772
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:44,749
I..I..

773
00:53:45,166 --> 00:53:46,540
Water regular or mineral, sir?

774
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:47,915
I like mineral water a lot.

775
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:49,832
I'll get it, sir.

776
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:52,374
Stupid fool!

777
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,832
I'm very hungry.
Let's eat and talk.

778
00:53:55,083 --> 00:53:56,124
Ok.

779
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:14,165
You start with salad.
I attack chicken and mutton.

780
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:22,249
I eat chicken, mutton and all
the non- Vegetarian item.

781
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,040
My friends always say,
you should've been..

782
00:54:27,125 --> 00:54:29,124
..born in a Christian,
not Hindu family.

783
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:30,665
Really?

784
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:32,665
My friends say I should've
been born..

785
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,540
..in Hindu not Christian family.

786
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:36,124
Why?

787
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:37,707
I'm a pure-vegetarian.

788
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:39,790
From childhood.

789
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:42,165
In fact I don't even like the
smell of non- Veg food.

790
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:43,874
I can't stand it.

791
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:46,874
Anyways,
you were saying something.

792
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,749
I'll kill you.

793
00:54:48,833 --> 00:54:51,999
We talk you to eat non-veg food,
not to kill anyone.

794
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:53,915
We made a mistake.

795
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,582
Did you say I love you or not?

796
00:54:55,666 --> 00:54:58,207
How could I?
You told me to eat mutton.

797
00:54:59,000 --> 00:54:59,999
Sorry, pal.

798
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:03,082
Your birthday plan failed.
You couldn't talk of marriage.

799
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:04,707
She talked about it.

800
00:55:04,916 --> 00:55:07,332
Wow! -She talked about marriage.
Congrats.

801
00:55:07,416 --> 00:55:08,832
What did she say?

802
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:10,165
Tell us.

803
00:55:11,166 --> 00:55:13,332
Tomorrow my friend Sandra
is getting married.

804
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:14,832
There is a dance party.

805
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,540
Will you be my dance partner?

806
00:55:18,458 --> 00:55:22,040
Your dance partner?
I dance very well. Come, Jenny.

807
00:55:22,708 --> 00:55:23,749
It's tomorrow.

808
00:55:23,916 --> 00:55:27,249
She made you your dance partner.
Make her life partner. -Yes.

809
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:34,499
Hi, Jenny.

810
00:55:39,875 --> 00:55:41,540
Cool! -Even you're cool!

811
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:42,999
Let's dance.

812
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:45,124
There is a problem, Prem.

813
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:46,874
What?

814
00:55:47,291 --> 00:55:48,332
Daddy is coming.

815
00:55:48,416 --> 00:55:50,582
It's good.
He'll dance with aunt Pinky.

816
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:54,374
No. Actually his friend Braganzaés
son Tony came from Goa.

817
00:55:54,875 --> 00:55:55,915
So?

818
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:57,874
Daddy wants me to take Tony along.

819
00:55:58,333 --> 00:56:00,540
We'll take him too.
Aren't kids allowed?

820
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:02,082
Tony isn't a kid.

821
00:56:02,791 --> 00:56:03,832
Hi, Jenny.

822
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:08,207
You're looking gorgeous, baby.
Beautiful.

823
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:09,790
Tony, this is my friend Prem.

824
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,457
Oh! I'm sorry. Hi, Prem.

825
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,249
We're getting late now.

826
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:18,249
This is for the beautiful girl.

827
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,790
Bye, sweet boy.

828
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:22,582
Come on.

829
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:26,040
I'm sorry. Bye. -We are going to
have absolutely great time.

830
00:56:29,875 --> 00:56:30,915
Who was he?

831
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,582
Let it be, friend.
My mood is ruined.

832
00:56:32,666 --> 00:56:35,540
It has to be. If someone else
takes your girlfriend.

833
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:38,874
That's fine.
But he called me sweet boy.

834
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:40,749
In front of my Jenny.

835
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:42,832
He insulted President.

836
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:46,874
Jenny, I've touched many
girls in my life.

837
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:51,207
But only you've touched my heart.

838
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:56,665
I even know that I'm the first
boy to have touched you.

839
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:03,582
Your mother told me you've
no boyfriend, no lover.

840
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:12,540
You know, Jenny. I'll marry the
girl whom nobody has touched.

841
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:17,665
Hi, uncle.

842
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:18,790
Uncle.

843
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:21,582
I'm not your uncle.

844
00:57:21,916 --> 00:57:26,124
How? You called me sweet boy,
so you're my uncle.

845
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:29,707
And Jenny,
we've to respect our elders.

846
00:57:30,125 --> 00:57:33,665
Bless me, uncle.
Until you don't apologize..

847
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,415
Sorry. Sorry.

848
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:38,624
Sweet uncle. Good. Very good.

849
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:40,332
Ok. Leave us alone now.

850
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:42,040
He's a strange fellow.

851
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:44,999
I was saying..the touch..

852
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:55,290
Oh, Jesus! Who is this boy.

853
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:57,624
I'm sorry, darling. I'll be back.

854
00:57:58,708 --> 00:57:59,749
Hi!

855
00:58:03,916 --> 00:58:06,790
Thank God you came.
Tony is such a pain.

856
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,999
Don't worry, Jenny.
I can't leave you in problem.

857
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:12,499
But what if he returns?

858
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:14,332
No problem.
I'll drive him away again.

859
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:16,790
If you wish, everything is easy.

860
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,165
Hi, Sandra! -Hi.

861
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:21,874
You look beautiful.
-Thank you. Enjoying.

862
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,415
Prem. He's my friend.

863
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:30,165
Hi, Prem.
This is my husband Peter.

864
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:33,665
Hi.
So you're Jenny's dance partner.

865
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:35,124
Hi, Sandra. -Hi.

866
00:58:35,416 --> 00:58:37,207
Excuse me. -Have fun, guys. -Bye.

867
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,957
Prem,
there is still time for the dance.

868
00:58:41,666 --> 00:58:44,957
I know, Jenny. I was warming up.

869
00:58:49,083 --> 00:58:50,332
Your party is over, man.

870
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,124
Bye. -What a party!
What a stupid friend you've!

871
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,082
Shall we talk alone?

872
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:04,040
Jenny! You must come to Goa.

873
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:06,624
Hi. -How are you, guys?

874
00:59:08,375 --> 00:59:09,540
Tony. -Sorry.

875
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:11,499
You fool!

876
00:59:17,333 --> 00:59:19,540
You know what? I've to..

877
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:24,540
Tony!

878
00:59:27,083 --> 00:59:30,749
Beautiful lady, come.
You look great today.

879
00:59:30,875 --> 00:59:32,540
A flower for you, beautiful!

880
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:36,749
What happened, darling?
-He kicked me. -Mistake.

881
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:39,332
You kicked colonel's wife.
-It was a mistake.

882
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:41,540
Donkey. -Sir. -Come out!

883
00:59:41,833 --> 00:59:43,540
Hi. -Hi.

884
00:59:53,208 --> 00:59:54,665
Get up, you rogue!

885
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:00,915
Why don't you understand, Jenny?

886
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,999
This boy doesn't deserve
to be with us.

887
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:15,040
How did it come here?
Sorry, Jenny.

888
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:16,374
I'll be back. Please.

889
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:20,165
Hi.

890
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:28,040
Tony,
why are you walking like this?

891
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,249
Ah! I'm very busy.

892
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:33,374
His trouser is dirty.

893
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:35,374
No,
I think he has stomach disorder.

894
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:47,124
Hey, man!

895
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:02,665
"Rock the world, friends!"

896
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:13,207
"Come on!
I can dance and stun the world!"

897
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,082
"Come in my arms, baby!"

898
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:29,832
"Rock the world.
Spread your charm!"

899
01:01:30,666 --> 01:01:34,790
"Rock the world.
Dance merrily, dear!"

900
01:01:39,583 --> 01:01:42,749
"Rock the world.
Spread your charm!"

901
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:48,249
"Rock the world.
Show it to them, dear!"

902
01:02:00,708 --> 01:02:04,957
"Come if you've the guts.
I'll dance and woo everyone."

903
01:02:11,458 --> 01:02:15,499
Oh boy! That was so much,
fun! Did you enjoy it? -Yeah!

904
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:17,457
Yes, Jenny. Did you like my dance?

905
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:21,332
You were rocking.
You're not less than a hero.

906
01:02:23,291 --> 01:02:24,499
What happened? -Nothing.

907
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:27,832
Jenny,
I feel elated when you're happy.

908
01:02:28,083 --> 01:02:29,249
You happy. I happy.

909
01:02:29,916 --> 01:02:32,540
Today I'm very happy
for Sandra also.

910
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:34,082
She found a nice boy.

911
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,915
What do you mean by 'Nice boy'?

912
01:02:36,458 --> 01:02:41,665
I mean, the boy who has a good
job and does work on time..

913
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:47,165
..and who is honest and gives
time to his family too.

914
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:52,082
That's it. This will make any
girl ready to get married.

915
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:53,957
Yes. Any girl will be ready.

916
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:27,499
Prem!

917
01:03:30,291 --> 01:03:31,582
I'm going to work, mother.

918
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:37,624
Hi, Prem. -Hi, Jenny.

919
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:41,332
I want..-I got a job.
And I've to reach on time.

920
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:43,082
Ok. Bye.

921
01:04:28,708 --> 01:04:30,790
Hello. -Prem, I've something
important to tell you.

922
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:34,165
Jenny, I'm on duty.
I work honestly.

923
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:37,707
And during work I don't talk.
Sorry, Jenny. Bye.

924
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:54,457
Prem.

925
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:57,790
Sorry, Jenny. I go home on time.

926
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,707
It's important to give time
to family too. Bye.

927
01:05:07,958 --> 01:05:12,207
My first hard earned money.
5000 rupees.

928
01:05:13,583 --> 01:05:15,165
It feels nice to count them,
friends.

929
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,207
Jenny will be happy too?

930
01:05:17,291 --> 01:05:19,624
She'll be very happy.

931
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,957
Go and talk to her.
You've not met her for a month.

932
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:26,582
I stayed away from her to get her.

933
01:05:26,916 --> 01:05:27,957
Stop.

934
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:31,290
Lakhan, where is Prem? -Wait.
I'll call him.

935
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:32,415
Prem.

936
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:36,374
Jenny, wait. Coming.

937
01:05:36,458 --> 01:05:38,624
No.
I'm in a hurry. Daisy is with me.

938
01:05:38,708 --> 01:05:39,915
Why is your phone turned off.

939
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,290
Jenny,
battery of my phone..-Take this.

940
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:45,415
Bye.

941
01:05:50,625 --> 01:05:52,582
Jenny gave me something.
-What is it?

942
01:05:54,333 --> 01:05:55,374
Stone.

943
01:05:55,958 --> 01:05:57,915
She threw stone.
-Something is written on it.

944
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,957
She gave me a letter.

945
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:06,540
I've to tell you something
important about my life.

946
01:06:07,541 --> 01:06:09,999
Come to Boat club at 1 1 tomorrow.

947
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:11,582
Oh! Very good.

948
01:06:12,166 --> 01:06:15,874
She wants to talk to me about
her life. What could it be?

949
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:18,540
That same thing that
you couldn't say.

950
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:20,415
What are you saying? Really?

951
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:22,040
Yes.

952
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:48,582
Hi, Jenny. -Hi.

953
01:06:57,875 --> 01:07:01,207
You wanted to talk
about your life..

954
01:07:01,875 --> 01:07:02,915
Yes.

955
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:09,499
Tell me.

956
01:07:17,916 --> 01:07:18,957
By the way, Jenny..

957
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,082
..even I'd to talk about my life.

958
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:30,374
Tell me.

959
01:07:31,708 --> 01:07:32,749
You go first.

960
01:07:36,541 --> 01:07:37,582
You first.

961
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:42,499
Ok.

962
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:48,957
Jenny, I..I like you a lot.

963
01:07:50,083 --> 01:07:51,540
I'll always keep you happy.

964
01:07:55,041 --> 01:07:56,374
Will you be my life partner.

965
01:08:01,708 --> 01:08:02,749
Jenny, tell me.

966
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:05,582
What can I say?

967
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:12,499
You've said what I
came to tell you.

968
01:08:19,666 --> 01:08:26,790
"Now that you've proposed to me.."

969
01:08:27,625 --> 01:08:34,832
"..I too feel like saying
I love you."

970
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:40,540
"I'm falling in love with you."

971
01:08:41,583 --> 01:08:48,374
"I'm losing myself
since I met you."

972
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:56,165
"I'm falling in love with you."

973
01:08:57,541 --> 01:09:03,957
"I'm losing myself
since I met you."

974
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:35,290
"I yearn to touch you."

975
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:42,749
"My heart beckons you
to come to me."

976
01:09:42,833 --> 01:09:47,207
"Come for dewdrops are
showering too."

977
01:09:47,625 --> 01:09:54,582
"The season is gesturing
you to come to me."

978
01:09:55,500 --> 01:10:03,499
"Take me in your arms."

979
01:10:03,625 --> 01:10:10,332
"I accept, I'm in love too."

980
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:16,374
"I'm falling in love with you."

981
01:10:17,458 --> 01:10:24,749
"I'm losing myself
since I met you."

982
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:29,540
You broke my dream. Sorry.

983
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:32,374
You should've ring the
bell like this.

984
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:33,999
Why?

985
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:37,915
How would a blind man know a
blind man is approaching?

986
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:40,749
I'm not blind.

987
01:11:29,375 --> 01:11:31,249
Prem. What happened?

988
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,457
What's the matter? -What happened?

989
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:38,540
Jenny didn't come to boat club.
Even her house is locked.

990
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:41,290
I don't get it.

991
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:44,624
It's Chandar. Talk to him.

992
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:46,374
Yes, Chandar. It's Kunnu.

993
01:11:47,458 --> 01:11:48,915
What? Jenny is in Goa?

994
01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:51,165
Yes, Chandar?

995
01:11:55,666 --> 01:11:58,457
I was surprised to see Jenny
in Goa. So I phoned you.

996
01:11:58,875 --> 01:12:01,165
Jenny shouldn't be with
that rogue Tony.

997
01:12:01,416 --> 01:12:03,332
Later I learnt that she's
getting married..

998
01:12:03,416 --> 01:12:04,790
..to Tony day after tomorrow.

999
01:12:07,041 --> 01:12:08,332
You want money?

1000
01:12:08,416 --> 01:12:12,207
I don't want it. -Leave it.

1001
01:12:31,333 --> 01:12:33,707
Dad, I've always listened to you.

1002
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:38,290
I never said no to
you for anything.

1003
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:42,999
But marriage..

1004
01:12:44,458 --> 01:12:47,957
It's my life.

1005
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:51,665
Is your life different from ours,
Jenny.

1006
01:12:52,458 --> 01:12:53,582
Please don't force me.

1007
01:12:54,125 --> 01:12:56,999
Why don't you want to marry Tony?

1008
01:12:57,416 --> 01:12:58,749
He's handsome and dashing.

1009
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:03,290
And he's rich. Briganza will
make our present and future.

1010
01:13:03,791 --> 01:13:04,832
Mother..

1011
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:09,207
I love someone else.

1012
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:11,207
Yes.

1013
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:14,457
Daddy, I love someone.

1014
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:18,040
Daddy, she has a lover.
I won't marry her.

1015
01:13:18,291 --> 01:13:19,332
Mrs. Pinto.

1016
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:22,957
It's not so.
Jenny is a clean girl.

1017
01:13:23,375 --> 01:13:26,124
She has no boyfriend.
No love. She's lying.

1018
01:13:26,208 --> 01:13:28,749
No, it's true.

1019
01:13:30,458 --> 01:13:32,249
I'm telling the truth.

1020
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:33,415
Enough!

1021
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,957
Briganza, gives you two choices.

1022
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:41,749
Either say 'I do' in front
of priest tomorrow..

1023
01:13:42,875 --> 01:13:45,624
..and become legal
wife of my Tony.

1024
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:50,207
If you say 'No' tomorrow
night Tony..

1025
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:53,707
..will forcefully make
you his wife.

1026
01:13:54,083 --> 01:13:55,124
Do you understand?

1027
01:14:11,125 --> 01:14:15,374
Jenny.

1028
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:31,999
Jenny, don't worry. I'm here.

1029
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:33,957
Jenny, control yourself.

1030
01:14:34,666 --> 01:14:35,707
Come on, Jenny.

1031
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:41,332
I was just thinking about you.

1032
01:14:42,291 --> 01:14:43,582
And you came.

1033
01:14:44,125 --> 01:14:46,665
Why wouldn't I come.

1034
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:50,165
How can I leave you in problem?

1035
01:14:51,166 --> 01:14:55,749
They want me to marry Tony.

1036
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:58,374
I heard, Jenny.

1037
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:03,290
Say yes for the wedding.

1038
01:15:05,666 --> 01:15:06,790
Don't worry.

1039
01:15:07,666 --> 01:15:12,165
When you go out with them,
we'll kidnap you on the way.

1040
01:15:13,666 --> 01:15:15,207
Is it possible?

1041
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:20,290
Double possible. We're champions
in kidnapping girls.

1042
01:15:20,666 --> 01:15:21,707
You know.

1043
01:15:25,666 --> 01:15:29,874
Yes, Jenny.
Leave for church with a smile.

1044
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:33,957
I promise, we'll make them
weep and flee with you.

1045
01:15:35,125 --> 01:15:37,165
Then you and I..

1046
01:15:37,458 --> 01:15:39,457
Rahul. Inform him too. -Yes.

1047
01:15:39,666 --> 01:15:41,374
I'll..-Who is Rahul?

1048
01:15:42,791 --> 01:15:45,540
Rahul..Oh my God!

1049
01:15:46,666 --> 01:15:49,790
I'm so sorry.

1050
01:15:50,416 --> 01:15:54,915
Rahul Chalan.
We used to study together.

1051
01:15:55,666 --> 01:16:00,332
Then he moved to Canada.
He returned last month.

1052
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:05,832
I tried to tell you about
him many times.

1053
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:11,540
But you were so buy these days,
I couldn't meet you.

1054
01:16:12,666 --> 01:16:16,457
And that day even in Boat club..

1055
01:16:17,458 --> 01:16:21,165
..I wanted to tell
you about Rahul.

1056
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,332
He's a nice guy. You'd like him.

1057
01:16:37,041 --> 01:16:41,457
He loves me very much.

1058
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:47,749
I love him too.
And we want to marry.

1059
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:53,957
Prem, are you alright?

1060
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:29,332
How far is the church, Tony?
-It's very close, Jenny.

1061
01:17:29,416 --> 01:17:32,165
Really? -Even I'm impatient
to get married.

1062
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:34,749
But this new driver
drives so slowly..

1063
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:36,374
..that dad's car went ahead.

1064
01:17:36,958 --> 01:17:39,374
Which fool hired you?
-Your dad, sir.

1065
01:17:39,708 --> 01:17:40,749
I'm sorry.

1066
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:42,582
Drive faster. -No, slow.

1067
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:45,332
I feel giddy when it's fast. -Ok.

1068
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:46,999
Don't worry, madam.

1069
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:49,874
I'm Chalu Chaplin,
driver of Happy Club.

1070
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:53,374
Hey, I've seen you before.
-Sure, sir.

1071
01:17:53,666 --> 01:17:56,207
Snap of my boss,
Charlie Chaplin is everywhere.

1072
01:17:56,291 --> 01:17:58,915
Yes, correct.
Even I saw it. -You too.

1073
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,707
I'll take you to your
destination..

1074
01:18:00,833 --> 01:18:02,457
..by short route and you'll happy.

1075
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:04,040
And sir will feel giddy. -Ok.

1076
01:18:19,166 --> 01:18:20,332
Lily! Lily!

1077
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:26,457
You blind fools!
I won't spare you.

1078
01:18:26,541 --> 01:18:27,582
I'm sorry.

1079
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:30,374
What have you done?
-You told me to drive fast.

1080
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:33,582
Yes, you did.
-My children, Lily, Bily..

1081
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:35,540
Small kids..-Kids? -Hen's chicks.

1082
01:18:35,625 --> 01:18:37,040
Two went here and two there.

1083
01:18:37,208 --> 01:18:38,790
Police. -No.

1084
01:18:42,708 --> 01:18:44,874
Give me your license.

1085
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:47,540
License? I don't have it.

1086
01:18:49,041 --> 01:18:51,540
Park the car this side.
-Officer, it's my wedding today.

1087
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:54,207
I'm already late.
-You can't drive without license.

1088
01:18:54,333 --> 01:18:55,374
This is a rule.

1089
01:18:55,458 --> 01:18:58,582
Correct. Rule is a rule.
-What a rule! I'll pull over.

1090
01:18:58,708 --> 01:19:01,457
Quick. -Nonsense! You're driving.
Ask him for license.

1091
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:03,040
How can I get license, sir?

1092
01:19:04,416 --> 01:19:05,499
I'm Chalu Chaplin.

1093
01:19:06,166 --> 01:19:08,832
I learnt driving by stealing cars.

1094
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:10,999
But I didn't steal license yet.

1095
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:14,374
Oh God! He's a honest boy.
He's confessing.

1096
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:16,624
Spare him and arrest him.

1097
01:19:16,916 --> 01:19:19,124
No..-Get out! -Save me, God.

1098
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,832
I remembered. I've license.

1099
01:19:21,875 --> 01:19:23,749
I keep it under the seat.

1100
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:31,915
Correct. Why did government give
you license. -To drive.

1101
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:33,332
And what are you driving?

1102
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:35,624
He's enjoying with madam
in back seat.

1103
01:19:35,708 --> 01:19:37,457
You don't drive even though
you've license.

1104
01:19:37,541 --> 01:19:39,207
You're insulting the government.
-No.

1105
01:19:39,291 --> 01:19:41,999
I'll arrest you.
-Today is my wedding.

1106
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:43,540
Ok.

1107
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:46,332
You've license.
So you'll drive? -Ok.

1108
01:19:46,416 --> 01:19:49,832
You don't have license, so you
enjoy with madam in back seat.

1109
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:52,999
Great, rule!
Tony, take your cap and come.

1110
01:19:53,375 --> 01:19:54,582
Ok. Let's go.

1111
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:58,457
But who will look for my Lily,
Chily and Bily.

1112
01:19:58,541 --> 01:20:00,582
Yes. -They went this side.

1113
01:20:01,083 --> 01:20:02,124
Here.

1114
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:07,207
Jenny. Jenny!

1115
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:11,874
Hello.

1116
01:20:11,958 --> 01:20:14,332
Dad, Jenny fled with the driver.
-What?

1117
01:20:14,958 --> 01:20:17,832
Prem, Tony might follow us.
Drive fast.

1118
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:41,957
Meet at Karbali bridge
in 1 5 minutes.

1119
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:58,290
Drive fast.

1120
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:17,999
Jenny!

1121
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,040
Prem!

1122
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:24,790
Prem, help.

1123
01:21:25,458 --> 01:21:26,665
Jenny, hold this!

1124
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:47,165
Prem!

1125
01:22:08,208 --> 01:22:09,415
Brother, there they're.

1126
01:22:50,541 --> 01:22:52,040
Stop the train. There they're.

1127
01:23:04,791 --> 01:23:06,082
Drop the rope!

1128
01:23:52,791 --> 01:23:54,082
Jenny loves someone else!

1129
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:57,999
She told you this last night,
but you didn't tell us.

1130
01:23:58,666 --> 01:23:59,999
Why did we take so much risk?

1131
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:02,082
For you and not for that Rahul.

1132
01:24:03,625 --> 01:24:04,790
Jenny loves him, Raju.

1133
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:07,540
Jenny used you and betrayed you.

1134
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:09,790
It's not so.

1135
01:24:10,583 --> 01:24:14,124
Jenny never told me
that she loves me.

1136
01:24:15,041 --> 01:24:17,665
But she knows that you love her.

1137
01:24:24,583 --> 01:24:27,582
How? Even I didn't tell her.

1138
01:24:29,625 --> 01:24:30,707
I couldn't say it.

1139
01:24:32,416 --> 01:24:36,999
Listen, Happy Club's rule is
to unite lovers. -Great!

1140
01:24:37,291 --> 01:24:40,165
We've united many.
We'll unite Jenny and Rahul too.

1141
01:24:41,833 --> 01:24:43,540
Shut down such a Happy club.

1142
01:24:52,708 --> 01:24:53,749
That's Rahul.

1143
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:00,040
Hi, Rahul. I'm Prem. -Hi, Prem.

1144
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:03,082
Do you go to gym? -Gym? Yes.

1145
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:06,290
I go twice in day. -Twice?

1146
01:25:06,583 --> 01:25:09,374
How many rounds do you perform
of dumbbells. -Round?

1147
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,499
Oh! You mean sets. -Yes, sets.

1148
01:25:11,791 --> 01:25:14,874
Not much. Only 5 sets of 20.

1149
01:25:15,166 --> 01:25:16,457
Total 1 00. That's all.

1150
01:25:16,958 --> 01:25:18,249
But your style is wrong.

1151
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:20,332
Give me. I'll teach you. -Really?

1152
01:25:21,041 --> 01:25:22,082
Take this.

1153
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:25,790
What happened? -Nothing.

1154
01:25:26,041 --> 01:25:27,540
I'm doing 'Push-ups'. -Like this?

1155
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:29,582
Yes, it's my style.

1156
01:25:31,375 --> 01:25:33,707
By the way, what problem does
your dad has with Jenny.

1157
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,249
Jenny is Christian and we're
high caste Hindus.

1158
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:38,124
You know my father,
Pitambar Jalan.

1159
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:39,707
Pitambar Jalan?

1160
01:25:40,541 --> 01:25:42,665
One contesting MLA election?
-Right.

1161
01:25:43,166 --> 01:25:45,207
I'm ready to elope
and marry Jenny.

1162
01:25:45,958 --> 01:25:50,415
But he's afraid that if I marry
her, he'll lose Hindu vote.

1163
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:58,582
Rahul, this is a big problem.

1164
01:25:59,416 --> 01:26:01,332
If you marry Jenny..

1165
01:26:02,541 --> 01:26:04,832
..your dad will lose the election.

1166
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:09,665
And those with respect..Is your
dad respectable? -Yes.

1167
01:26:09,833 --> 01:26:11,332
No, not at all. -What?

1168
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,165
He can't tolerate this defeat?

1169
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:17,207
I've seen many losers
commit suicide.

1170
01:26:18,333 --> 01:26:20,040
No. I won't let this
marriage take place.

1171
01:26:20,541 --> 01:26:23,665
But Jenny..-You've called
me friend. A true friend.

1172
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:27,749
I'm thinking about you.
Is Jenny dearer than father? -No.

1173
01:26:28,291 --> 01:26:32,999
You'll get many Jenny's,
but you get only one father.

1174
01:26:33,416 --> 01:26:34,874
And just once.

1175
01:26:35,041 --> 01:26:36,499
We even fall in love only once.

1176
01:26:36,708 --> 01:26:38,332
I love Jenny.
I'm going to marry Jenny.

1177
01:26:38,625 --> 01:26:39,665
I don't care.

1178
01:26:42,875 --> 01:26:45,415
Wow! You've become big.

1179
01:26:47,125 --> 01:26:48,624
You don't care for your father.

1180
01:26:49,583 --> 01:26:53,040
You've made body and muscles.

1181
01:26:53,916 --> 01:26:56,165
But try to look farther. Yes.

1182
01:26:56,291 --> 01:26:57,332
Yes, that's it.

1183
01:26:58,583 --> 01:27:04,040
A small toddler, that's Rahul..

1184
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:11,457
..is holding his father's big
finger with his small finger..

1185
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,332
..and he's learning to walk.

1186
01:27:19,583 --> 01:27:21,290
But my nanny taught me to walk,
not my dad.

1187
01:27:22,791 --> 01:27:23,832
Really? -Yes.

1188
01:27:23,916 --> 01:27:25,082
Then look farther.

1189
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:26,790
Yes.

1190
01:27:27,791 --> 01:27:36,707
A scared, frightened and
small, but fat Rahul..

1191
01:27:37,875 --> 01:27:41,915
..is holding his father's
shoulder and pedaling.

1192
01:27:46,875 --> 01:27:48,290
He's learning to ride cycle.

1193
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:51,082
But Ramu taught me to ride cycle,
not my dad.

1194
01:27:51,166 --> 01:27:53,290
Did your dad teach you anything?
-Yes.

1195
01:27:53,708 --> 01:27:55,707
To play cards. Poker.

1196
01:27:58,958 --> 01:28:00,040
Poker!

1197
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:02,415
Your father is so great.

1198
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:04,124
He cares a lot for you.

1199
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,957
He taught you poker.

1200
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:11,124
He'd have thought even if
you become worthless..

1201
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:13,082
..you won't starve to death.

1202
01:28:13,833 --> 01:28:16,290
And you're leaving such a
great father for a girl.

1203
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:18,665
No, Rahul. I won't let his
marriage take place.

1204
01:28:18,791 --> 01:28:20,499
But..-Not even if you cry.

1205
01:28:20,583 --> 01:28:22,249
Jenny. -Don't worry about her.

1206
01:28:23,041 --> 01:28:24,832
You've called me friend.
A true friend.

1207
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:28,624
For you,
only for you I'll support Jenny.

1208
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:32,374
What? -But become a support
of your father.

1209
01:28:32,458 --> 01:28:34,874
Wait. I can't leave Jenny.

1210
01:28:34,958 --> 01:28:37,624
I'll marry Jenny only.
I don't want dad's property.

1211
01:28:38,083 --> 01:28:39,665
I'm an MBA from London.

1212
01:28:40,083 --> 01:28:42,124
I'll get a job of 2 lakh
salary in a snap.

1213
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,582
How? -In a snap.

1214
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,207
Now tell me, will you let
this marriage take place?

1215
01:28:50,083 --> 01:28:51,915
2 lakh per month? -Yes.

1216
01:28:53,166 --> 01:28:54,415
Come at platform number 2.

1217
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:01,249
Did you tell him the right
platform? -Yes.

1218
01:29:01,333 --> 01:29:02,665
Why isn't he here yet?

1219
01:29:05,833 --> 01:29:07,082
He'd be on his way, Jenny.

1220
01:29:08,833 --> 01:29:10,249
Did you like Rahul?

1221
01:29:11,166 --> 01:29:12,790
You met him for the
first time today.

1222
01:29:13,666 --> 01:29:15,165
Rahul? -Hey, Jenny.

1223
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,874
Rahul. -I missed you so much.

1224
01:29:20,125 --> 01:29:21,374
I missed you too.

1225
01:29:21,916 --> 01:29:23,915
I'm sorry, Jenny. -It's ok.

1226
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,957
It's fine. -You were in problem,
but I couldn't help.

1227
01:29:27,166 --> 01:29:30,374
Now I'm here.
Trust me. I'll take care of you.

1228
01:29:32,083 --> 01:29:33,207
I missed you so much.

1229
01:29:34,541 --> 01:29:35,582
Thank, Prem.

1230
01:29:35,833 --> 01:29:37,707
We'll marry in temple tomorrow.

1231
01:29:38,125 --> 01:29:39,749
Wedding will be very simple,
Jenny.

1232
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:41,874
And for honeymoon I'll take
you around the world.

1233
01:29:41,958 --> 01:29:43,999
London, New York, Milan, Paris.

1234
01:29:44,083 --> 01:29:45,707
And we'll settle in Frankfurt.

1235
01:29:46,166 --> 01:29:47,207
Frankfurt?

1236
01:29:47,291 --> 01:29:49,374
My friend is offering me a
partnership in his business.

1237
01:29:49,458 --> 01:29:52,082
And I've booked a car for you.
Ferrari.

1238
01:29:53,333 --> 01:29:55,915
What do you think, Prem?
Ferrari? Frankfurt? Good plan?

1239
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,040
Konkan Express is about
to leave platform 2.

1240
01:29:59,125 --> 01:30:00,790
Come on, Jenny.
Let's go. We'll be late.

1241
01:30:00,916 --> 01:30:02,540
Which is the compartment, Prem?
-This.

1242
01:30:03,041 --> 01:30:04,082
Yes. -Ticket.

1243
01:30:04,375 --> 01:30:05,415
Thanks. Take care.

1244
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:06,665
Let's go, Jenny.

1245
01:30:09,083 --> 01:30:11,415
Prem, come along.

1246
01:30:12,916 --> 01:30:13,999
I'd have come, Jenny.

1247
01:30:14,916 --> 01:30:17,207
But God knows what problem
Tony will create here.

1248
01:30:17,291 --> 01:30:18,332
Prem.

1249
01:30:20,291 --> 01:30:21,957
Your name is written
here with Jenny.

1250
01:30:23,083 --> 01:30:24,374
Yes, that..

1251
01:30:25,125 --> 01:30:28,290
So that nobody comes to know,
David gave my name..

1252
01:30:29,166 --> 01:30:30,374
It makes no difference.

1253
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,957
God has written your
name with Jenny.

1254
01:31:09,125 --> 01:31:12,707
Prem, you should've told her
once how much you loved her.

1255
01:31:13,208 --> 01:31:15,665
I'm sure, she'd have..-Let it be.

1256
01:31:16,625 --> 01:31:18,040
Let's talk about something else.

1257
01:31:20,166 --> 01:31:21,457
I couldn't say it to her.

1258
01:31:23,125 --> 01:31:24,165
So wasn't it love?

1259
01:31:26,708 --> 01:31:28,124
Is it important to say in love?

1260
01:31:31,041 --> 01:31:32,499
Hey, what did Chandar use to say?

1261
01:31:33,375 --> 01:31:35,082
Feelings. Only feelings.

1262
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:38,624
Love with dictionary?

1263
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,332
My feelings too were in vain.

1264
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,832
Let it be.
Let's talk about something else.

1265
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,040
Rahul is a nice boy.

1266
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,915
He's from a decent family.
He's rich.

1267
01:32:03,041 --> 01:32:04,332
They talk in English.

1268
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:05,999
Perfect match.

1269
01:32:07,375 --> 01:32:08,415
Listen..

1270
01:32:10,291 --> 01:32:11,457
..both are vegetarian.

1271
01:32:22,375 --> 01:32:24,165
Let it be.
Let's talk about something else.

1272
01:32:30,541 --> 01:32:31,707
He'll keep her happy.

1273
01:32:37,916 --> 01:32:43,707
I too would've kept you
very happy, Jenny.

1274
01:32:48,375 --> 01:32:52,290
I liked you a lot.

1275
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:03,665
Will you become my life partner?

1276
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:11,915
Why don't you understand..

1277
01:33:16,583 --> 01:33:17,624
..my feelings.

1278
01:33:27,125 --> 01:33:28,957
Let it be.
Let's talk about something else.

1279
01:33:57,208 --> 01:33:58,249
Jenny.

1280
01:34:15,291 --> 01:34:16,332
Why are you back?

1281
01:34:19,333 --> 01:34:20,374
I'm happy.

1282
01:34:21,208 --> 01:34:22,249
I'm your friend.

1283
01:34:22,958 --> 01:34:25,499
No complaints. No demand.

1284
01:34:27,416 --> 01:34:29,707
Prem. You're like this..

1285
01:34:32,041 --> 01:34:33,290
You're drunk?

1286
01:34:34,375 --> 01:34:35,415
Drunk?

1287
01:34:35,958 --> 01:34:39,665
Jenny, in English we say drink.
Drink.

1288
01:34:44,416 --> 01:34:46,999
Why are you so upset?
Are you drink too?

1289
01:34:49,791 --> 01:34:51,207
Prem! Prem!

1290
01:34:52,708 --> 01:34:53,999
Jenny.

1291
01:34:54,375 --> 01:34:56,457
You're really here?

1292
01:34:56,875 --> 01:34:58,082
Why and how are you here?

1293
01:34:58,583 --> 01:34:59,624
I just came.

1294
01:35:00,791 --> 01:35:01,832
And you..

1295
01:35:02,916 --> 01:35:03,957
You're drunk.

1296
01:35:04,166 --> 01:35:05,207
No, Jenny.

1297
01:35:06,458 --> 01:35:09,957
Actually to celebrate your
wedding, friend served me.

1298
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:14,665
But how come you're here?

1299
01:35:15,541 --> 01:35:16,582
Where is Rahul?

1300
01:35:19,375 --> 01:35:20,415
I don't know.

1301
01:35:21,583 --> 01:35:23,249
He got down at a station
to buy books..

1302
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:25,999
..and then, I don't know.

1303
01:35:27,833 --> 01:35:29,082
He didn't come back.

1304
01:35:33,208 --> 01:35:34,374
Where could I've gone?

1305
01:35:36,083 --> 01:35:37,707
You did good by coming here.

1306
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:39,999
But Rahul..

1307
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,124
Jenny, can I say something
if you don't mind?

1308
01:35:49,916 --> 01:35:52,874
These rich and spoilt brats
are like this only?

1309
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,249
For them love is a game.

1310
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:57,999
Time pass.

1311
01:36:02,625 --> 01:36:04,249
No, I was just kidding.

1312
01:36:04,375 --> 01:36:05,415
I'm sorry.

1313
01:36:05,583 --> 01:36:08,457
I'll find Rahul anyhow.

1314
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,040
Don't worry, Jenny.

1315
01:36:17,041 --> 01:36:18,165
You won't understand.

1316
01:36:19,916 --> 01:36:21,915
I'll understand. Tell me.

1317
01:36:24,958 --> 01:36:26,665
You won't understand
even if I tell you.

1318
01:36:27,708 --> 01:36:29,040
Why not?

1319
01:36:29,416 --> 01:36:31,082
I'm very smart.
Why won't I understand?

1320
01:36:31,666 --> 01:36:33,415
Because you've never loved anyone.

1321
01:36:35,666 --> 01:36:39,665
"How can I tell you
why I love you?"

1322
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:42,457
"I can't even if I try."

1323
01:36:43,666 --> 01:36:50,165
"My eyes express the feelings
of my heart."

1324
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:57,457
"You don't realize it."

1325
01:36:58,416 --> 01:36:59,457
Shooting star!

1326
01:37:02,458 --> 01:37:05,999
"You don't realize it."

1327
01:37:06,125 --> 01:37:13,957
"We couldn't unite even after
meeting. God knows why."

1328
01:37:14,083 --> 01:37:22,040
"We are miles apart.
God knows why."

1329
01:37:22,125 --> 01:37:30,124
"These are strange circumstances.
God knows why."

1330
01:37:30,208 --> 01:37:39,040
"My dreams are woven around you.
God knows why."

1331
01:37:41,583 --> 01:37:45,499
"How can I tell you
why I love you?"

1332
01:37:45,625 --> 01:37:48,332
"I can't even if I try."

1333
01:37:49,625 --> 01:37:56,332
"My eyes express the feelings
of my heart."

1334
01:37:56,416 --> 01:38:27,999
"You don't realize it."

1335
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:35,582
"I've said a lot to you
in my thoughts."

1336
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:41,207
"But I couldn't say it
in front of you."

1337
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:51,915
"You weren't a stranger to me.."

1338
01:38:52,208 --> 01:38:57,165
"..but you couldn't even be mine."

1339
01:38:58,375 --> 01:39:06,082
"I regret,
even this heart mourns."

1340
01:39:06,416 --> 01:39:12,082
"But yet this crazy
weaves dreams."

1341
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:20,082
"It thinks we'd meet,
God knows why."

1342
01:39:20,166 --> 01:39:28,165
"We are miles apart.
God knows why."

1343
01:39:28,291 --> 01:39:36,040
"These are strange circumstances.
God knows why."

1344
01:39:36,125 --> 01:39:45,082
"My dreams are woven around you.
God knows why."

1345
01:39:47,666 --> 01:39:54,374
"How can I tell you why I love
you? I can't even if I try."

1346
01:39:55,375 --> 01:40:02,374
"My eyes express the feelings
of my heart."

1347
01:40:02,458 --> 01:40:29,624
"You don't realize it."

1348
01:40:35,166 --> 01:40:37,582
Your son hasn't returned
since last night.

1349
01:40:37,791 --> 01:40:38,832
Loafer!

1350
01:40:38,958 --> 01:40:40,624
He didn't even phone. -He'll come.

1351
01:40:40,708 --> 01:40:42,249
When?

1352
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:45,457
Mr. Mishra is ready to
get his Shakuntala..

1353
01:40:45,583 --> 01:40:48,165
..married to him after
I implored him

1354
01:40:48,875 --> 01:40:50,832
I thought this worthless
is living off him.

1355
01:40:50,958 --> 01:40:52,124
Later he'll live there.

1356
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,457
They're coming to see Prem.

1357
01:40:55,916 --> 01:40:57,040
Whom will I show them?

1358
01:40:57,875 --> 01:40:58,915
Oh God!

1359
01:41:04,625 --> 01:41:05,749
Good morning, mother.

1360
01:41:06,166 --> 01:41:08,040
What are you doing here? Come in.

1361
01:41:08,125 --> 01:41:09,915
Mother, someone else is with me.

1362
01:41:10,583 --> 01:41:11,624
Who?

1363
01:41:13,791 --> 01:41:15,207
Who is she? -Je..

1364
01:41:15,291 --> 01:41:16,332
Jennifer.

1365
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,915
Did she flee her house?
-No, mother. She's not like that.

1366
01:41:20,208 --> 01:41:21,249
I helped her flee.

1367
01:41:21,625 --> 01:41:23,082
You'll elope and marry her.

1368
01:41:23,166 --> 01:41:25,499
No, mother.
Not for me, but for someone else.

1369
01:41:25,583 --> 01:41:28,499
What's this new business?
-It's not a business, but help.

1370
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:30,874
But why did you bring her here?

1371
01:41:30,958 --> 01:41:32,624
The one for whom I brought her,
has fled.

1372
01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:33,915
And she came to me.

1373
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,499
So we came to you.

1374
01:41:35,583 --> 01:41:37,165
Hide the girl for 2 days, mother.

1375
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:39,332
I'll find that boy. -Oh God!

1376
01:41:39,416 --> 01:41:41,582
They're coming to see the boy
and he has brought a girl.

1377
01:41:41,666 --> 01:41:43,707
What are you whispering?

1378
01:41:44,083 --> 01:41:45,999
She agreed.
Thank you, mother. -Thank you.

1379
01:41:46,083 --> 01:41:48,290
Jenny, get in. -From here? -Yes.

1380
01:41:48,375 --> 01:41:50,332
My dad is outside,
but my mother will handle it.

1381
01:41:50,416 --> 01:41:52,624
Pull her, mother. Pull her.

1382
01:41:52,708 --> 01:41:55,290
Use more strength. -Oh God!

1383
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:58,249
Eat this and get ready quickly.
-Why, mother?

1384
01:41:58,583 --> 01:42:00,540
Mr. Mishra is coming with
his daughter to see you.

1385
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:02,207
Mother, what's this new trouble?

1386
01:42:02,291 --> 01:42:04,832
That's ok.
But where is the trouble brought?

1387
01:42:04,958 --> 01:42:06,165
Jenny is bathing. -Oh God!

1388
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:08,249
Your dad is going to bathroom too.

1389
01:42:08,333 --> 01:42:09,374
Mother, stop him.

1390
01:42:12,125 --> 01:42:13,999
Where are you going? -To bathe.

1391
01:42:14,375 --> 01:42:16,540
What's the rush? Please wait.

1392
01:42:19,333 --> 01:42:20,749
What happened to you, Sharda?

1393
01:42:20,833 --> 01:42:23,457
Mr. Mishra would be here and
you know I'm never late.

1394
01:42:23,916 --> 01:42:24,957
Be late today.

1395
01:42:25,708 --> 01:42:26,957
Look into my eyes.

1396
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:28,915
Sharda.

1397
01:42:31,375 --> 01:42:32,415
Jenny.

1398
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:35,374
It's been years since I heard
you sing. Please sing.

1399
01:42:35,958 --> 01:42:36,999
What is it, Sharda?

1400
01:42:37,708 --> 01:42:38,749
Please sing.

1401
01:42:40,583 --> 01:42:42,249
Which son? -That one..

1402
01:42:47,166 --> 01:42:55,124
"Damsel, your beauty is full of.."

1403
01:42:55,208 --> 01:42:56,665
Mother, which beggar is singing?

1404
01:42:57,333 --> 01:42:58,374
Turn off the radio.

1405
01:43:00,083 --> 01:43:02,457
Prem.
When did Prem come? -Just now.

1406
01:43:02,875 --> 01:43:04,290
Go and bathe. Don't waste time.

1407
01:43:10,041 --> 01:43:11,207
Hurry up, Jenny.

1408
01:43:11,625 --> 01:43:13,207
Don't rush me.

1409
01:43:13,791 --> 01:43:15,082
Sharda.

1410
01:43:15,458 --> 01:43:20,165
Oh my God! In hurry I forgot
my top in the bathroom.

1411
01:43:20,833 --> 01:43:21,874
Darn it!

1412
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,957
What's this? -This..

1413
01:43:26,333 --> 01:43:27,582
This belongs to a girl.

1414
01:43:27,875 --> 01:43:29,249
You wear these too?

1415
01:43:29,708 --> 01:43:30,749
It's not mine.

1416
01:43:31,416 --> 01:43:32,540
Where did you get it?

1417
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:35,624
I didn't brought it. -Me neither.

1418
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:40,082
I found it in bathroom.
Whom does it belong?

1419
01:43:40,625 --> 01:43:42,082
It seems to be of a girl. -Mother.

1420
01:43:42,166 --> 01:43:44,040
This..-Mother, did you see my top?

1421
01:43:44,291 --> 01:43:45,415
God knows where it's.

1422
01:43:45,958 --> 01:43:47,999
It's here.
What will you do? Give me.

1423
01:43:48,833 --> 01:43:52,665
"Beware, lover.."

1424
01:43:53,625 --> 01:43:56,832
You wear this. -Yes. It's latest
fashion. Do you like it?

1425
01:43:56,916 --> 01:43:58,165
I'll get for you too. Two.

1426
01:43:58,250 --> 01:44:00,540
Mother,
I'm going to a big interview.

1427
01:44:00,625 --> 01:44:01,665
Bless me.

1428
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:04,374
You'll go out in this? -Yes.

1429
01:44:04,708 --> 01:44:06,832
How else will I get two for you?
-Shut up!

1430
01:44:06,916 --> 01:44:07,957
Bye, mother. -No.

1431
01:44:08,166 --> 01:44:09,915
If you go like this,
I'll b defamed.

1432
01:44:10,208 --> 01:44:11,665
Mr. Sharma. -I'm defamed.

1433
01:44:11,916 --> 01:44:13,999
Hello. -Hello, Mr. Mishra.

1434
01:44:14,083 --> 01:44:15,124
Hi.

1435
01:44:16,541 --> 01:44:19,124
What is he wearing?
-You liked it too.

1436
01:44:19,416 --> 01:44:22,165
I'm getting two for dad.
I'll bring two for you too. -What?

1437
01:44:22,583 --> 01:44:24,790
What a cool top?
Get one for me too.

1438
01:44:24,875 --> 01:44:26,624
Please. -Of course. -Shut up!

1439
01:44:26,708 --> 01:44:28,082
Make your father wear this top.

1440
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:29,540
I don't mind.

1441
01:44:29,791 --> 01:44:30,874
Shankar. -Yes.

1442
01:44:30,958 --> 01:44:33,082
Get him treated by a good doctor.
Ok?

1443
01:44:33,916 --> 01:44:35,999
Let's go. We came to see a boy.

1444
01:44:36,583 --> 01:44:37,624
Bye.

1445
01:44:46,541 --> 01:44:47,915
Laugh as much as you want.

1446
01:44:52,708 --> 01:44:53,749
I'm sorry.

1447
01:44:54,875 --> 01:44:56,457
I'm troubling you a lot.

1448
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,207
Yes. That's true.

1449
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:04,040
But for this smile,
I can take any trouble. No worry.

1450
01:45:06,166 --> 01:45:07,540
I'm Prem.

1451
01:45:08,541 --> 01:45:10,249
Prem Chopra.

1452
01:45:15,666 --> 01:45:17,249
What a big house Rahul has!

1453
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:19,332
It's a mansion.

1454
01:45:23,333 --> 01:45:25,874
That Christian girl wants
to be daughter- In-law..

1455
01:45:25,958 --> 01:45:26,999
..of Pitambar Jalan?

1456
01:45:27,375 --> 01:45:28,624
Never!

1457
01:45:29,791 --> 01:45:34,499
Thank God Bhairav Singh
saw him at station..

1458
01:45:34,625 --> 01:45:36,082
..and brought him here forcefully.

1459
01:45:37,208 --> 01:45:40,665
Or else I'd have been defamed.

1460
01:45:41,041 --> 01:45:42,624
Sir, it was good.

1461
01:45:43,041 --> 01:45:44,165
And it had to happen.

1462
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:48,207
Because in your horoscope your
stars have return home.

1463
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:49,582
Yes.

1464
01:45:49,833 --> 01:45:51,624
That will bring me profit.

1465
01:45:51,708 --> 01:45:53,790
But this fool will take everything
from this house.

1466
01:45:54,291 --> 01:45:56,665
This trouble had to come
during election time.

1467
01:45:57,083 --> 01:45:58,124
Enough!

1468
01:45:58,916 --> 01:46:01,499
Now he'll return to Canada.
-This is unfair, dad.

1469
01:46:01,583 --> 01:46:02,957
Bhairav Singh. -Sir?

1470
01:46:03,541 --> 01:46:05,415
Don't think that he's my son.

1471
01:46:05,958 --> 01:46:08,290
I'm Rajput, sir. I promise.

1472
01:46:09,125 --> 01:46:11,624
After club house function
day after..

1473
01:46:11,916 --> 01:46:14,082
..tomorrow,
I'll take him to Canada.

1474
01:46:14,375 --> 01:46:19,290
And he won't return to India until
he doesn't forget Jenny.

1475
01:46:19,375 --> 01:46:21,582
She's a great girl.
-I love her a lot.

1476
01:46:21,958 --> 01:46:23,332
I can do anything for her.

1477
01:46:23,666 --> 01:46:26,499
And Bhairav Singh can
do anything for me.

1478
01:46:26,875 --> 01:46:28,082
Right? -Sir.

1479
01:46:28,708 --> 01:46:32,832
If you say, forget him I can
even behead his father.

1480
01:46:33,833 --> 01:46:35,457
Narayan! -What did you say?

1481
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,249
Change this ringtone.

1482
01:46:43,875 --> 01:46:44,915
Hello.

1483
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,249
Future chief minister..

1484
01:46:46,875 --> 01:46:50,540
..Pitambar Jalan's present
secretary, Sheshadari speaking..

1485
01:46:50,666 --> 01:46:51,874
Give phone to Pitambar.

1486
01:46:52,458 --> 01:46:53,499
Narayan!

1487
01:46:54,083 --> 01:46:56,332
Sir, for you.

1488
01:46:57,958 --> 01:46:58,999
Hello.

1489
01:47:00,750 --> 01:47:02,249
This is Sajid Don.

1490
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:05,915
You avoid my phone.

1491
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,624
No, Don. It's not so. Actually..

1492
01:47:10,708 --> 01:47:12,040
..I was busy with election.

1493
01:47:12,125 --> 01:47:13,290
Beware, Pitambar!

1494
01:47:15,708 --> 01:47:19,165
At my one gesture,
my sharp shooters..

1495
01:47:19,666 --> 01:47:22,082
..are ready to shower bullets.

1496
01:47:23,333 --> 01:47:24,832
When are you sending 1 billion.

1497
01:47:25,833 --> 01:47:28,040
I don't have the money, Don.

1498
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:30,207
I'm contesting election
with donation.

1499
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:32,790
Then collect donation and send
1 billion to me too quickly.

1500
01:47:34,541 --> 01:47:38,415
Hello.

1501
01:47:38,916 --> 01:47:39,957
Hello!

1502
01:47:41,166 --> 01:47:42,665
Pitambar hung up on me.

1503
01:47:43,250 --> 01:47:44,290
Dial again.

1504
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:45,665
I'll behead him.

1505
01:47:46,083 --> 01:47:47,999
He hung up on Sajid Don.

1506
01:47:49,041 --> 01:47:51,915
Don boss,
Pitambar didn't hung up..

1507
01:47:52,083 --> 01:47:53,665
..but your phone got disconnected.

1508
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:54,999
You've no balance.

1509
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:58,999
Idiots!

1510
01:48:00,666 --> 01:48:01,832
I'm your boss.

1511
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,665
At least recharge my phone
on time. -Yes, sir.

1512
01:48:11,791 --> 01:48:14,290
You all are fools!
You carry pistol without bullets.

1513
01:48:14,416 --> 01:48:15,915
We've neither money nor bullets.

1514
01:48:16,625 --> 01:48:17,999
Hello, sir. -Hello.

1515
01:48:18,625 --> 01:48:20,249
Who are you?

1516
01:48:20,750 --> 01:48:22,290
Sir, we've come to meet Rahul.

1517
01:48:22,750 --> 01:48:24,332
What do you want from Rahul?

1518
01:48:25,458 --> 01:48:26,582
We're Jenny's friend.

1519
01:48:27,458 --> 01:48:29,457
Rahul and Jenny love each other.

1520
01:48:29,541 --> 01:48:33,290
Don't dare to take that girl's
name in this house!

1521
01:48:35,125 --> 01:48:38,249
Get out of this city
before evening.

1522
01:48:39,333 --> 01:48:43,874
If I hear that girl's name,
I'll get you and that girl killed.

1523
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:45,290
Now get out!

1524
01:49:03,583 --> 01:49:04,999
What's the matter, inspector?

1525
01:49:05,333 --> 01:49:08,457
Where is Jenny? -Jenny? Who?

1526
01:49:08,875 --> 01:49:09,915
Jenny isn't here.

1527
01:49:10,125 --> 01:49:11,874
Jenny is our daughter.

1528
01:49:12,166 --> 01:49:14,665
Your son Prem has eloped
with her from Goa.

1529
01:49:15,291 --> 01:49:16,499
From Goa! -Goa?

1530
01:49:16,583 --> 01:49:18,874
Yes.
-My son has never been to Goa.

1531
01:49:19,125 --> 01:49:20,999
And we never heard of any Jenny.

1532
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:22,415
Right, Sharda? -Yes.

1533
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:24,457
Only we two are in this house.

1534
01:49:24,583 --> 01:49:25,957
Jenny isn't here.

1535
01:49:26,166 --> 01:49:27,332
We'll search the house.

1536
01:49:27,416 --> 01:49:30,540
I said, Jenny isn't here.
-We've to search the house.

1537
01:49:30,625 --> 01:49:31,957
No need, inspector.

1538
01:49:32,708 --> 01:49:34,957
Look, even the girl is saying
that there is no need.

1539
01:49:35,041 --> 01:49:36,832
What's your name, child? -Jenny.

1540
01:49:36,916 --> 01:49:38,124
Jenny. Jenny!

1541
01:49:39,458 --> 01:49:41,457
This goon spoilt our wedding.

1542
01:49:41,666 --> 01:49:42,915
Arrest him! -Arrest him!

1543
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,665
How can you arrest him?
-Just a minute.

1544
01:49:44,750 --> 01:49:46,249
I won't spare him.

1545
01:49:46,375 --> 01:49:47,915
I'll break your hands.

1546
01:49:48,541 --> 01:49:51,374
No fighting. Please don't fight.

1547
01:49:51,583 --> 01:49:52,915
You tell me the truth.

1548
01:49:54,833 --> 01:49:57,165
Sir, these people have raised me.

1549
01:49:57,791 --> 01:49:59,124
And I'm very grateful to them.

1550
01:49:59,583 --> 01:50:01,499
But I didn't want to marry.

1551
01:50:02,041 --> 01:50:04,582
And she forced me to marry Tony.

1552
01:50:05,875 --> 01:50:08,082
You love someone else.

1553
01:50:12,333 --> 01:50:13,540
Don't worry. She doesn't.

1554
01:50:16,083 --> 01:50:17,124
Yes.

1555
01:50:17,208 --> 01:50:19,040
Who is that boy?

1556
01:50:25,166 --> 01:50:26,207
Prem.

1557
01:50:30,125 --> 01:50:33,457
Did you see?
He eloped with the girl for her.

1558
01:50:33,541 --> 01:50:35,124
Prem, you lied to me.

1559
01:50:35,208 --> 01:50:36,582
Daddy, saw? They're lovers?

1560
01:50:36,708 --> 01:50:38,832
Tell me the truth.
-He does everything..

1561
01:50:38,916 --> 01:50:40,332
Peter, why don't you shout?

1562
01:50:41,666 --> 01:50:42,707
You too shout.

1563
01:50:43,791 --> 01:50:45,790
Your son didn't give me
the right to shout.

1564
01:50:45,875 --> 01:50:48,582
Calm down!
Why don't you keep quiet.

1565
01:50:50,208 --> 01:50:51,374
You tell me the truth.

1566
01:50:51,958 --> 01:50:53,207
Or else I'll arrest you.

1567
01:50:58,875 --> 01:51:01,665
Tell them how much you love me,
Prem.

1568
01:51:02,583 --> 01:51:03,624
Tell everyone.

1569
01:51:07,916 --> 01:51:09,832
What can I say?

1570
01:51:12,166 --> 01:51:15,040
How much I love you?

1571
01:51:20,291 --> 01:51:23,290
I can only say..

1572
01:51:27,541 --> 01:51:31,457
..for Jenny I can..

1573
01:51:33,375 --> 01:51:34,415
..do anything.

1574
01:51:37,708 --> 01:51:38,749
Jenny..

1575
01:51:41,708 --> 01:51:45,124
..is everything for me.

1576
01:51:48,041 --> 01:51:49,540
She's my joy.

1577
01:51:51,875 --> 01:51:53,415
She's my life.

1578
01:51:54,291 --> 01:51:56,124
That's enough. You're over-acting.

1579
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:01,624
Inspector, did you hear?

1580
01:52:01,708 --> 01:52:04,040
Lie! They both are lying.

1581
01:52:04,333 --> 01:52:05,999
You're intelligent, inspector.

1582
01:52:06,083 --> 01:52:07,999
Get Tony and Jenny married.

1583
01:52:08,083 --> 01:52:09,915
God will bless you. -Shut up!

1584
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,665
I'm an inspector, not a priest.

1585
01:52:13,041 --> 01:52:15,249
Don't waste my time. Go.

1586
01:52:15,916 --> 01:52:16,957
Let's go.

1587
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,832
Sorry, Prem.
I couldn't say Rahul's name.

1588
01:52:28,625 --> 01:52:30,249
You know why?

1589
01:52:30,833 --> 01:52:31,874
Never mind, Jenny.

1590
01:52:34,416 --> 01:52:35,999
Why don't you talk to Jenny.

1591
01:52:37,166 --> 01:52:38,207
About what, mother?

1592
01:52:39,166 --> 01:52:40,957
That you love her a lot.

1593
01:52:41,250 --> 01:52:43,707
No. I don't love Jenny.

1594
01:52:44,541 --> 01:52:46,999
I was acting in front
of inspector..

1595
01:52:47,416 --> 01:52:48,665
..but I did over acting.

1596
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,915
Shut up! I'm your mother,
I understand everything.

1597
01:52:54,041 --> 01:52:55,290
Jenny is a nice girl.

1598
01:52:56,333 --> 01:52:57,540
I too like her.

1599
01:52:58,291 --> 01:52:59,999
I'll talk to her. -No, mother.

1600
01:53:00,833 --> 01:53:02,082
Jenny loves Rahul.

1601
01:53:02,666 --> 01:53:03,999
Rahul is from a big family.

1602
01:53:04,250 --> 01:53:05,999
And he's giving him a car..

1603
01:53:06,083 --> 01:53:07,457
..what is it..

1604
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,499
Fafari. -Ferrari.

1605
01:53:09,625 --> 01:53:10,957
Yes. That's the one.

1606
01:53:12,250 --> 01:53:14,874
Mother,
I can't even take that car's..

1607
01:53:15,208 --> 01:53:16,707
..name and he's gifting it to her.

1608
01:53:17,375 --> 01:53:19,499
Jenny will live like queen there.
-Let's wash dishes.

1609
01:53:19,583 --> 01:53:20,999
Let me talk to her.

1610
01:53:21,083 --> 01:53:24,082
Mother,
don't torture her emotionally.

1611
01:53:24,291 --> 01:53:25,749
Jenny considers me her friend.

1612
01:53:25,833 --> 01:53:27,249
Don't break our friendship.

1613
01:53:28,250 --> 01:53:29,624
Jenny is happy with Rahul.

1614
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,582
And my happiness is
in her happiness.

1615
01:53:31,916 --> 01:53:33,165
Are you really happy?

1616
01:53:34,666 --> 01:53:36,624
Yes, mother. I'm very happy.

1617
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,999
We've to arrange the
money quickly.

1618
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:44,499
I won't spare this Pitambar.

1619
01:53:45,083 --> 01:53:46,915
This son of Pitambar..

1620
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:48,999
Son?

1621
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:50,999
Ok.

1622
01:53:51,458 --> 01:53:54,124
We'll kidnap Pitambar's son Rahul.

1623
01:53:54,208 --> 01:53:55,999
Wow! -Great!

1624
01:53:56,625 --> 01:53:58,499
Rahul's birthday function
is in this club house.

1625
01:53:59,166 --> 01:54:00,540
This is our chance, friends.

1626
01:54:00,625 --> 01:54:03,290
Our dress will be black
pant and white shirt.

1627
01:54:03,583 --> 01:54:06,165
With black pant and white shirt,
white bow.

1628
01:54:06,291 --> 01:54:07,332
Correct.

1629
01:54:07,583 --> 01:54:09,999
And everyone will sport
French beard.

1630
01:54:10,041 --> 01:54:12,749
With French beard,
a black mole here.

1631
01:54:13,375 --> 01:54:16,999
Right.
This will make our gang unique.

1632
01:54:17,208 --> 01:54:18,707
And there won't be any confusion.

1633
01:54:18,791 --> 01:54:21,999
And we'll surround Rahul
slowly and slowly.

1634
01:54:22,333 --> 01:54:24,624
And we'll kidnap him when
we get a chance.

1635
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,749
Any doubt? -No, sir.

1636
01:54:26,916 --> 01:54:27,957
And Jenny..

1637
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:29,540
Jenny.

1638
01:54:30,166 --> 01:54:35,665
I'll turn her into style
queen Katrina Kaif.

1639
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:37,290
"Touch me!"

1640
01:54:51,583 --> 01:54:53,457
"Rock the floor and don't stop!"

1641
01:54:53,708 --> 01:54:55,749
"Dazzle everyone and don't stop!"

1642
01:54:55,916 --> 01:54:59,457
"Rock the floor.
Spread your charm!"

1643
01:55:00,208 --> 01:55:04,499
"Rock the world.
Dance merrily, dear!"

1644
01:55:04,625 --> 01:55:08,207
"Rock the floor.
Spread your charm!"

1645
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:13,207
"Rock the world.
Show it to them, dear!"

1646
01:55:13,375 --> 01:55:17,665
"Everything that's mine
belongs to you."

1647
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:21,249
"Nothing else is left now."

1648
01:55:22,083 --> 01:55:26,457
"I want to talk to
you all the time."

1649
01:55:26,541 --> 01:55:30,082
"Nothing else is left now."

1650
01:55:30,375 --> 01:55:34,540
"This love is a meditation."

1651
01:55:34,625 --> 01:55:39,165
"There is no way to avoid it now."

1652
01:55:39,541 --> 01:55:56,499
"We forget everything else
when we fall in love."

1653
01:55:57,333 --> 01:56:01,374
"Rock the floor.
Spread your charm!"

1654
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:05,665
"Rock the world.
Dance merrily, dear!"

1655
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:09,374
"Rock the floor.
Spread your charm!"

1656
01:56:09,458 --> 01:56:14,249
"Rock the world.
Show it to them, dear!"

1657
01:56:14,416 --> 01:56:18,374
"May I be with you all the time!"

1658
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:21,874
"May you rule my thoughts too."

1659
01:56:22,916 --> 01:56:30,540
"I should always think and
talk about only you."

1660
01:56:31,458 --> 01:56:40,540
"Beloved, in love we can't
see anything else."

1661
01:56:40,666 --> 01:56:57,874
"We forget everything else
when we fall in love."

1662
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,207
"I got you,
this is the result of my love."

1663
01:57:28,291 --> 01:57:31,624
"You're my destination."

1664
01:57:32,791 --> 01:57:36,999
"My happiness lies in
your happiness."

1665
01:57:37,083 --> 01:57:40,415
"Every trouble is wiped now."

1666
01:57:41,250 --> 01:57:45,415
"Love is unrestrained magic."

1667
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:50,290
"There is no hurdle before love."

1668
01:57:50,375 --> 01:58:07,499
"We forget everything else
when we fall in love."

1669
01:58:10,791 --> 01:58:11,832
Rahul!

1670
01:58:12,708 --> 01:58:14,082
Bhairav Singh, where is Rahul?

1671
01:58:15,125 --> 01:58:16,165
Rahul!

1672
01:58:18,416 --> 01:58:21,124
Jenny! Rahul!

1673
01:58:37,708 --> 01:58:39,624
What? What did you say?

1674
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:42,499
My son!

1675
01:58:42,833 --> 01:58:44,457
Dear, don't mourn.

1676
01:58:45,250 --> 01:58:46,790
Nothing has happened to your son.

1677
01:58:46,875 --> 01:58:49,624
He has just cut his vein
and maligned us.

1678
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,790
My son has cut his veins!

1679
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:54,415
Tell me, where do I've to come?

1680
01:58:55,041 --> 01:58:56,540
Yes, we won't inform the police.

1681
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:58,874
We're coming. Take care of him.

1682
01:59:00,791 --> 01:59:03,499
Come.
You're late. -Where is my son?

1683
01:59:03,583 --> 01:59:06,082
Here. Follow this red blood.

1684
01:59:06,166 --> 01:59:07,457
You'll reach your son.

1685
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:09,957
Rahul! My son!

1686
01:59:11,041 --> 01:59:12,249
Blood! -Hello, sir.

1687
01:59:12,625 --> 01:59:16,374
We called the doctor, but he
fainted on seeing so much blood.

1688
01:59:16,458 --> 01:59:17,832
He's lying there. Look.

1689
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:20,124
Narayan! -You? -Yes.

1690
01:59:20,416 --> 01:59:23,249
You kidnapped Rahul from club.
-Yes, but to help him.

1691
01:59:23,375 --> 01:59:25,374
I didn't know he'd cut his veins.

1692
01:59:25,458 --> 01:59:27,874
So I phoned you to help him.

1693
01:59:27,958 --> 01:59:29,999
I don't need anyone's help.
I'm dying.

1694
01:59:30,750 --> 01:59:34,582
Don't go anywhere, sir.

1695
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,040
We know your dad is very lowly.

1696
01:59:37,166 --> 01:59:39,332
But listen to your mother. -No!

1697
01:59:40,083 --> 01:59:43,499
I love Jenny. Jenny is my life.

1698
01:59:44,041 --> 01:59:46,457
She's my life.
She's everything for me.

1699
01:59:48,125 --> 01:59:50,749
What are you doing, Jenny?
Body doesn't have so much blood.

1700
01:59:50,833 --> 01:59:51,999
But there is in bucket.

1701
01:59:52,125 --> 01:59:53,874
I can't live without Jenny.

1702
01:59:55,125 --> 01:59:58,749
If you bleed so much,
you can't live even with Jenny.

1703
01:59:59,416 --> 02:00:01,749
I told you that we'll
get you married.

1704
02:00:01,958 --> 02:00:03,957
We won't marry without
dad's blessing.

1705
02:00:04,833 --> 02:00:07,207
Listen to me. -I'd enough of you.

1706
02:00:07,291 --> 02:00:10,624
In your quarrel,
you'll lose your son.

1707
02:00:10,708 --> 02:00:13,915
Blood. Who killed whom?

1708
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:18,749
Who are you? -I'm a reporter,
Tainat Singh, of a news channel.

1709
02:00:18,875 --> 02:00:20,665
No! -Get him out!

1710
02:00:22,041 --> 02:00:23,915
Get them out of here.

1711
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,665
Don't worry, uncle. I won't let
a decent man be defamed.

1712
02:00:26,791 --> 02:00:28,582
You know how great he's? -No.

1713
02:00:28,666 --> 02:00:31,415
Let it be if he doesn't know.
-How could I?

1714
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:34,457
I can't see Pitambar Jalan
getting defamed.

1715
02:00:34,583 --> 02:00:36,915
Oh! So he's Pitambar Jalan.

1716
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:40,582
Who is he? -At least leave him,
son. -Don't worry.

1717
02:00:40,666 --> 02:00:44,665
I won't tell anyone your only
son Rahul has cut his veins.

1718
02:00:44,750 --> 02:00:47,207
Really? His son has cut his veins.
Why?

1719
02:00:47,291 --> 02:00:50,249
At least leave that.
-Don't worry, uncle.

1720
02:00:50,375 --> 02:00:52,374
I know what this reporter
wants to get out of me.

1721
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:55,874
That Rahul loves a Christian
girl and you disapprove.

1722
02:00:55,958 --> 02:00:57,499
But I won't say anything about it.

1723
02:00:57,583 --> 02:01:00,457
You told everything harping
'Don't worry'.

1724
02:01:00,583 --> 02:01:03,290
Now this tape will be telecast
on all the news channel.

1725
02:01:03,375 --> 02:01:06,457
Breaking news.
Enemy of love, Pitambar Jalan.

1726
02:01:06,541 --> 02:01:07,665
No!

1727
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:09,082
Sir, stop him.

1728
02:01:09,375 --> 02:01:12,374
If this news is leaked,
you'll lose the election.

1729
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:15,207
Give me this tape. -No.

1730
02:01:15,333 --> 02:01:17,374
Don't worry, uncle.
I won't let you lose the election.

1731
02:01:17,666 --> 02:01:19,999
Come with me. -Yes, get it.

1732
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,457
Congrats, uncle.

1733
02:01:24,541 --> 02:01:26,540
He's ready to give the tape.
-Very good!

1734
02:01:26,625 --> 02:01:28,374
Thank you very much.
Give me the tape.

1735
02:01:28,458 --> 02:01:30,124
But he has one condition. -What?

1736
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:32,207
Rahul and Jenny should
marry with a pomp.

1737
02:01:32,333 --> 02:01:33,457
With dance and music.

1738
02:01:33,708 --> 02:01:36,999
And you should announce this
marriage on all news channel.

1739
02:01:37,208 --> 02:01:40,082
Or else I'll lose my place
in the community.

1740
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:41,874
If this marriage doesn't
take place..

1741
02:01:41,958 --> 02:01:43,082
..you'll lose public's respect.

1742
02:01:43,166 --> 02:01:47,165
Now tell me, what do you want
to save? -Public's respect.

1743
02:01:47,416 --> 02:01:49,540
Sir, it's no problem if you
lose community.. -Enough.

1744
02:01:50,166 --> 02:01:52,624
Ok, fine. I agree.

1745
02:01:52,708 --> 02:01:54,999
But tape shouldn't be telecast.

1746
02:01:55,041 --> 02:01:56,665
Don't worry, uncle.
-Again don't worry.

1747
02:01:56,750 --> 02:01:58,374
This tape won' t be telecast.

1748
02:01:58,458 --> 02:02:00,415
Now wedding tape will be telecast.

1749
02:02:00,708 --> 02:02:02,999
Congrats, uncle. Congrats, aunt.

1750
02:02:03,458 --> 02:02:05,124
Congrats, Rahul.
-Thank you, friend.

1751
02:02:06,250 --> 02:02:07,874
Congratulation on your wedding,
Jenny.

1752
02:02:10,458 --> 02:02:11,499
Thanks.

1753
02:02:12,833 --> 02:02:14,749
I thank you too.

1754
02:02:19,166 --> 02:02:21,582
How is it? -It's beautiful.

1755
02:02:22,958 --> 02:02:25,832
What's the cost?
-Forget that and wear it first.

1756
02:02:25,916 --> 02:02:27,290
Come on.

1757
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:31,999
Tell me.

1758
02:02:36,541 --> 02:02:38,832
What are you doing?
Someone might see us.

1759
02:02:39,375 --> 02:02:41,249
Nobody is here. Cafe is closed.

1760
02:02:41,833 --> 02:02:42,874
Jenny!

1761
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,874
Oh! So sorry. -Prem. Come.

1762
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:47,624
Where were you?

1763
02:02:47,750 --> 02:02:49,499
This is for Jenny. -Prem, look.

1764
02:02:50,583 --> 02:02:53,374
Rahul has brought it.
-Beauty. Beauty.

1765
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:55,374
It's worth 150 million. -What?

1766
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:57,582
I liked it,
so I brought it for Jenny.

1767
02:02:58,041 --> 02:03:00,540
Yes, you were saying something.
What did you get for Jenny?

1768
02:03:01,375 --> 02:03:03,707
Spicy fritters and mint sauce.

1769
02:03:03,875 --> 02:03:04,915
Jenny loves it.

1770
02:03:08,625 --> 02:03:09,665
Rahul!

1771
02:03:11,041 --> 02:03:12,540
I'm sorry.

1772
02:03:17,375 --> 02:03:20,249
Rahul! -I'm sorry.
One minute, Prem.

1773
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,499
I just remembered.
I got a phone from USA.

1774
02:03:39,583 --> 02:03:41,874
This is the list of VIP.
Keep their seating separate.

1775
02:03:42,250 --> 02:03:44,374
Nobody should've security problem.
Ok? -Sir.

1776
02:03:44,458 --> 02:03:45,832
Sir, phone for you.

1777
02:03:46,791 --> 02:03:50,124
Hello. -Preparing for the wedding,
Pitambar?

1778
02:03:51,916 --> 02:03:55,082
But the bride is with me.

1779
02:03:56,291 --> 02:03:58,165
And this time we've
made no mistake.

1780
02:03:59,083 --> 02:04:01,082
We've kidnapped original Jenny.

1781
02:04:04,208 --> 02:04:05,249
Talk to him.

1782
02:04:06,750 --> 02:04:09,457
Uncle, please save me.

1783
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,915
Uncle. Uncle.

1784
02:04:15,625 --> 02:04:16,665
Did you hear her?

1785
02:04:17,708 --> 02:04:19,915
Now send 1 billion quickly.

1786
02:04:20,833 --> 02:04:23,582
Or else I'll send the girl's
corpse at the wedding dais.

1787
02:04:25,291 --> 02:04:26,874
This is a big problem, Sheshadri.

1788
02:04:26,958 --> 02:04:28,040
What happened, sir?

1789
02:04:28,125 --> 02:04:30,249
Sajid Don kidnapped Jenny.

1790
02:04:30,958 --> 02:04:32,457
Sir, this is very good.

1791
02:04:33,041 --> 02:04:34,165
What's good about it?

1792
02:04:34,916 --> 02:04:37,415
Wedding is tomorrow and bride got
kidnapped today. -What's good?

1793
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:39,832
Sir, our public is emotional.

1794
02:04:40,291 --> 02:04:41,832
Your daughter-in-law is kidnapped.

1795
02:04:42,375 --> 02:04:46,374
People will get sentimental and
vote for you. Sympathy vote.

1796
02:04:46,750 --> 02:04:48,374
You'll surely win.

1797
02:04:48,750 --> 02:04:50,999
Wow! Great!

1798
02:04:51,125 --> 02:04:53,332
Jenny's life is in danger and
you're thinking of money.

1799
02:04:53,416 --> 02:04:56,415
It's not that. -Forget it.
Arrange for the money..

1800
02:04:56,500 --> 02:04:58,790
..we'll free Jenny first.

1801
02:04:58,916 --> 02:05:01,874
Prem, you don't understand.
1 billion is a big amount.

1802
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,874
It would be. But it's not
more than Jenny's life.

1803
02:05:42,541 --> 02:05:45,874
Who are you? -Yes, who are you?

1804
02:05:46,833 --> 02:05:49,999
Sir Pitambar has send ransom
money for Jenny.

1805
02:05:50,500 --> 02:05:51,540
Prem.

1806
02:05:51,708 --> 02:05:52,957
Show us what's in the bag.

1807
02:05:53,958 --> 02:05:56,124
We don't talk to servants.
Call your boss.

1808
02:05:57,958 --> 02:05:59,207
I'm the boss.

1809
02:06:00,250 --> 02:06:01,499
Don't give me that look.

1810
02:06:01,958 --> 02:06:03,540
I'm boss. Look.

1811
02:06:04,625 --> 02:06:08,874
We boss have personalities,
auras and strong voices. -Yes.

1812
02:06:08,958 --> 02:06:11,540
Right, gang? -Yes.

1813
02:06:11,791 --> 02:06:12,832
What's right?

1814
02:06:13,750 --> 02:06:14,957
Who gives you food?

1815
02:06:15,166 --> 02:06:16,749
You do, sir. -Right.

1816
02:06:17,125 --> 02:06:19,957
Then tell him. -Yes.

1817
02:06:20,375 --> 02:06:23,790
No matter how he's, he's our boss.

1818
02:06:24,500 --> 02:06:25,540
Really?

1819
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,832
Give them the bag.
Money is in the bag.

1820
02:06:28,166 --> 02:06:29,707
Give it to them.

1821
02:06:31,625 --> 02:06:33,332
Don't dare to touch the bag.

1822
02:06:33,916 --> 02:06:35,582
Big boss, tell me where is Jenny?

1823
02:06:36,250 --> 02:06:37,290
Jenny.

1824
02:06:38,125 --> 02:06:39,165
Jenny, come.

1825
02:06:42,000 --> 02:07:09,624
Prem. -Jenny.

1826
02:07:11,875 --> 02:07:14,082
I knew it. I knew you'd come.

1827
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:17,165
How can I leave you in problem?

1828
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:18,999
Let's go, Jenny.

1829
02:07:19,875 --> 02:07:21,999
Big boss, we've kept the money.
We're going.

1830
02:07:22,083 --> 02:07:23,165
Bye. -Stop.

1831
02:07:26,041 --> 02:07:28,999
I'm Sajid Don.
Don't act smart with me.

1832
02:07:31,291 --> 02:07:34,165
Those who cheat me..

1833
02:07:51,083 --> 02:07:53,582
I don't spare them.

1834
02:08:12,583 --> 02:08:13,874
First I'll check the money.

1835
02:08:14,958 --> 02:08:15,999
Count it. -Yes, sir.

1836
02:08:42,208 --> 02:08:44,124
Sir, the amount is correct.

1837
02:08:44,833 --> 02:08:46,207
The amount is correct? -Yes.

1838
02:08:46,583 --> 02:08:48,499
Yes, the amount is correct.

1839
02:08:49,166 --> 02:08:50,332
Correct. -Yes, sir.

1840
02:08:50,625 --> 02:08:51,957
It's 1 000 rupees currencies.

1841
02:08:52,083 --> 02:08:54,457
Big boss, the amount is correct.
Forgive us now.

1842
02:08:56,083 --> 02:08:57,207
Is there any mistake?

1843
02:08:57,458 --> 02:08:59,957
No, sir. We've counted the money.

1844
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,124
It's hard cash..

1845
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:04,457
..fresh out of bank, sir.

1846
02:09:04,541 --> 02:09:05,665
We got it from there.

1847
02:09:06,333 --> 02:09:07,374
I forgave you. Go.

1848
02:09:07,458 --> 02:09:11,082
Gang, big boss is distributing
cash. Come.

1849
02:09:11,666 --> 02:09:15,124
Sir, the best thing is that
all notes have same number.

1850
02:09:15,416 --> 02:09:16,832
There won't be any problem.

1851
02:09:16,916 --> 02:09:19,207
Same number on all the notes?
-Yes.

1852
02:09:19,291 --> 02:09:20,957
My foot! Nab them!

1853
02:09:24,541 --> 02:09:26,165
Sir, what are you doing?

1854
02:09:26,291 --> 02:09:28,624
We'd only 5 bullets, not it's 4.

1855
02:09:28,708 --> 02:09:31,290
4 bullets are enough for 4 people,
Robert. Come.

1856
02:09:37,375 --> 02:09:38,665
Let's run! Run!

1857
02:09:41,708 --> 02:09:42,749
Come on. Hurry!

1858
02:09:55,083 --> 02:09:57,040
Prem, stop or I'll kill her.

1859
02:10:08,791 --> 02:10:10,540
Stupid fool! Get me down.

1860
02:10:17,208 --> 02:10:34,290
Get me down, fool!

1861
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:48,832
Jenny, what are you doing?

1862
02:10:49,041 --> 02:10:51,332
Sorry, Prem. -Ok, be careful.

1863
02:10:59,833 --> 02:11:01,124
Jenny. -I'm sorry.

1864
02:11:01,208 --> 02:11:04,415
What are you doing? -Help.
-Help? -Yes.

1865
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:05,957
Sit in that corner. -Go.

1866
02:11:18,875 --> 02:11:19,915
Stop!

1867
02:11:21,833 --> 02:11:23,999
Jenny, on whose side are you?

1868
02:11:24,541 --> 02:11:25,582
On your side.

1869
02:11:25,791 --> 02:11:26,999
Is there any confusion?

1870
02:11:27,416 --> 02:11:28,457
Should I lock it?

1871
02:11:28,791 --> 02:11:29,832
Give it to me.

1872
02:11:30,791 --> 02:11:32,249
Fight!

1873
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:41,540
Fool!

1874
02:11:46,166 --> 02:11:47,957
Dad. -Stop.

1875
02:11:48,041 --> 02:11:49,540
He's my dad. -Hello.

1876
02:11:50,291 --> 02:11:52,665
How come you're here? -From pipe.

1877
02:11:52,791 --> 02:11:54,665
Not that.
Why did you get in danger?

1878
02:11:55,041 --> 02:11:57,290
You can stake your life for
a love of a few days.

1879
02:11:57,916 --> 02:11:59,165
You're my own son.

1880
02:11:59,583 --> 02:12:01,624
Can't I risk my life for you?

1881
02:12:02,041 --> 02:12:04,415
Wow! What a dialogue?
Say it again.

1882
02:12:04,500 --> 02:12:06,874
You can stake your life for
a love of a few days.

1883
02:12:07,375 --> 02:12:08,707
You're my own son.

1884
02:12:09,041 --> 02:12:10,790
Can't I risk my life for you?

1885
02:12:10,958 --> 02:12:13,957
Ok! Risk your life! Let's
do it together.

1886
02:12:22,125 --> 02:12:23,165
Oh my God!

1887
02:12:42,208 --> 02:12:43,832
Oh! -Sorry.

1888
02:12:46,458 --> 02:12:47,499
Prem.

1889
02:13:14,625 --> 02:13:16,499
Jenny, run. Come on.

1890
02:13:19,541 --> 02:13:37,915
Prem!

1891
02:13:52,666 --> 02:13:56,082
Hold it!

1892
02:14:01,791 --> 02:14:03,457
Don't leave it!

1893
02:14:29,166 --> 02:14:31,540
What are you doing, Jenny?
-Sorry, Prem.

1894
02:14:31,875 --> 02:14:34,332
Turn it down. Down. Yes.

1895
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,665
Slowly. Carefully.

1896
02:14:45,291 --> 02:14:46,624
Move!

1897
02:14:48,250 --> 02:14:49,540
Thank God!

1898
02:14:51,791 --> 02:14:53,540
Look, sir. Look.

1899
02:14:53,625 --> 02:14:55,457
Nobody will move. -Jenny.

1900
02:14:55,583 --> 02:14:57,332
Nab them! -Stop.
The police are here.

1901
02:15:00,083 --> 02:15:01,124
Thank you, Prem.

1902
02:15:01,208 --> 02:15:03,165
You've got a criminal
like Sajid arrested.

1903
02:15:03,250 --> 02:15:05,165
Don't leave me. I'm giddy.

1904
02:15:05,250 --> 02:15:06,290
Shut up!

1905
02:15:06,833 --> 02:15:08,874
Tomorrow our photographer
will click your snap.

1906
02:15:09,250 --> 02:15:11,124
It will be published in front
page of newspaper.

1907
02:15:11,625 --> 02:15:13,290
Well done. Keep it up.

1908
02:15:13,375 --> 02:15:15,040
President. -Wow, Prem!

1909
02:15:15,500 --> 02:15:17,082
Your dream has come true.

1910
02:15:17,166 --> 02:15:19,165
Your photo will be published
in newspaper.

1911
02:15:20,250 --> 02:15:21,832
Your mother will be very happy,
son.

1912
02:15:24,375 --> 02:15:26,165
And you, father?

1913
02:15:27,500 --> 02:15:28,624
I'll be double happy.

1914
02:15:29,500 --> 02:15:31,874
Don't give me the look. Hug me.

1915
02:15:38,208 --> 02:15:39,749
Sir, Mr. Agrawal is here.

1916
02:15:40,375 --> 02:15:42,957
Come, Mr. Agrawal. Welcome.

1917
02:15:46,375 --> 02:15:48,082
What happened, Jenny?
You're looking lost.

1918
02:15:48,208 --> 02:15:49,499
You should be happy today.

1919
02:15:49,625 --> 02:15:51,915
You're marrying the one you love.

1920
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:53,165
What more do you want?

1921
02:16:25,083 --> 02:16:26,707
Hi, Jenny. -Hi.

1922
02:16:31,125 --> 02:16:32,165
You look great!

1923
02:16:37,875 --> 02:16:39,207
Mother and father didn't come.

1924
02:16:39,291 --> 02:16:41,457
They'd be on their way.

1925
02:16:44,208 --> 02:16:45,665
And our Happy club.

1926
02:16:46,250 --> 02:16:47,290
They've come.

1927
02:16:48,208 --> 02:16:49,332
They must be around.

1928
02:17:04,041 --> 02:17:05,082
Congrats, Jenny.

1929
02:17:19,083 --> 02:17:21,665
Hurry up, Jenny. It's time
to take the nuptial round.

1930
02:17:35,500 --> 02:17:36,582
Bye, Jenny.

1931
02:17:39,333 --> 02:17:40,374
Where?

1932
02:17:43,583 --> 02:17:45,415
I've some important work.

1933
02:17:48,791 --> 02:17:51,415
More important than my wedding.

1934
02:17:55,541 --> 02:17:56,707
God bless you, Jenny!

1935
02:18:11,958 --> 02:18:14,624
At least we made friendship.

1936
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,582
No complaints. No demand.

1937
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,957
How can I leave you in problem!

1938
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,415
It makes no difference, Rahul.

1939
02:18:21,875 --> 02:18:24,415
God has written your
name with Jenny.

1940
02:18:28,791 --> 02:18:35,665
For Jenny I can do anything.

1941
02:18:44,041 --> 02:18:45,915
Jenny, what happened?

1942
02:18:46,333 --> 02:18:48,040
Nothing. -You ok?

1943
02:18:48,625 --> 02:18:51,582
Listen, media wants to meet you.

1944
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:54,040
Why?

1945
02:18:54,125 --> 02:18:56,290
We told media my dad
and I saved you..

1946
02:18:56,375 --> 02:18:58,457
..and rescued your from Sajid Don.

1947
02:18:58,875 --> 02:19:00,415
They want you to say it.
So say that.

1948
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:04,290
But Prem..-We know Prem
did everything.

1949
02:19:04,375 --> 02:19:06,249
But you've to say what we said.

1950
02:19:06,916 --> 02:19:08,499
Rahul, this is wrong.

1951
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:10,207
Prem has done it.

1952
02:19:10,291 --> 02:19:12,707
Now you think about this house,
not Prem.

1953
02:19:12,791 --> 02:19:14,332
You're daughter-in-law
of this house.

1954
02:19:14,416 --> 02:19:16,582
If you say so,
dad will gain in election.

1955
02:19:17,083 --> 02:19:18,207
He'll win.

1956
02:19:19,208 --> 02:19:25,457
Rahul, Prem always helped
others and us selflessly.

1957
02:19:26,458 --> 02:19:27,999
He even got defamed because of it.

1958
02:19:28,750 --> 02:19:32,332
Today when he's getting fame,
we should snatch that too.

1959
02:19:32,416 --> 02:19:33,499
Don't argue, Jenny.

1960
02:19:34,208 --> 02:19:36,874
We've talked to Prem. When he has
no problem, why do you care?

1961
02:19:38,833 --> 02:19:40,957
What did he say?
-He said, it's Jenny's house.

1962
02:19:41,458 --> 02:19:43,082
He can do anything for
your happiness.

1963
02:19:48,250 --> 02:19:49,832
Why did he say so?

1964
02:19:49,958 --> 02:19:52,499
Come on, Jenny. He cares for you.

1965
02:19:56,666 --> 02:19:58,707
Come. -Congrats, madam.

1966
02:19:58,791 --> 02:20:02,582
Congrats. -Tell us,
who saved you from Sajid Don.

1967
02:20:03,166 --> 02:20:04,207
Tell them, Jenny.

1968
02:20:05,375 --> 02:20:06,665
He's a great guy.

1969
02:20:07,708 --> 02:20:09,290
He has always supported me.

1970
02:20:10,250 --> 02:20:11,457
He's my best friend.

1971
02:20:12,250 --> 02:20:14,415
No complaints. No demand.

1972
02:20:15,416 --> 02:20:17,082
His name is Prem.

1973
02:20:18,041 --> 02:20:19,415
Prem, president of Happy Club.

1974
02:20:19,500 --> 02:20:20,957
But Jenny, about me..-Yes.

1975
02:20:21,375 --> 02:20:22,707
He helped him too.

1976
02:20:23,125 --> 02:20:24,999
Prem saved him too. -Jenny..

1977
02:20:25,083 --> 02:20:26,374
Yes, he saved him from him.

1978
02:20:26,500 --> 02:20:30,290
He locked his son so that
he can't marry me.

1979
02:20:30,375 --> 02:20:32,457
Because I'm Christian.
-But dad agreed.

1980
02:20:33,041 --> 02:20:34,207
For his gain.

1981
02:20:35,208 --> 02:20:36,332
But now I'm refusing.

1982
02:20:37,208 --> 02:20:39,665
Because I love Prem.

1983
02:20:40,083 --> 02:20:41,624
And I'll marry him.

1984
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:45,749
Jenny, please don't leave me.
I love you.

1985
02:20:45,833 --> 02:20:47,915
No, you don't. You like me.

1986
02:20:48,333 --> 02:20:50,457
You don't love me, but like me.

1987
02:20:51,125 --> 02:20:52,540
Try to understand. -Yes.

1988
02:20:53,291 --> 02:20:55,790
Love,
like..I just don't understand.

1989
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:57,957
You've gone mad.

1990
02:20:58,333 --> 02:21:00,332
Yes, I've gone mad.

1991
02:21:01,541 --> 02:21:03,040
I'm madly in love with Prem.

1992
02:21:03,666 --> 02:21:05,082
Goodbye. Good luck.

1993
02:21:05,875 --> 02:21:06,915
Jenny!

1994
02:21:08,583 --> 02:21:10,332
Where is Prem?
-We don't know, Jenny.

1995
02:21:12,708 --> 02:21:13,749
Don't know?

1996
02:21:14,583 --> 02:21:15,624
What do you mean?

1997
02:21:16,833 --> 02:21:18,332
You came late, Jenny.

1998
02:21:18,875 --> 02:21:20,124
He left.

1999
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:24,540
We don't know where he went
and when he'll return.

2000
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:47,999
Jesus.

2001
02:21:50,166 --> 02:21:51,374
Good afternoon, Jesus.

2002
02:21:51,458 --> 02:21:53,665
No, my son. I'm an actor.

2003
02:21:54,500 --> 02:21:56,415
I'm playing Jesus in a drama.

2004
02:21:57,250 --> 02:22:00,290
I'd to reach on this address
quickly so I left in costume.

2005
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,457
I lost my way.
Can you please help me?

2006
02:22:05,250 --> 02:22:06,457
This is inside the city.

2007
02:22:07,125 --> 02:22:08,374
And I'm leaving the city.

2008
02:22:09,125 --> 02:22:11,999
I've decided not to
return to city.

2009
02:22:12,125 --> 02:22:14,415
Prem, you help everyone.

2010
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,082
Help me too, please.

2011
02:22:16,666 --> 02:22:17,707
God will help you.

2012
02:22:18,791 --> 02:22:20,665
Come on. Come inside.

2013
02:22:21,750 --> 02:22:22,790
Come on.

2014
02:22:54,375 --> 02:22:55,749
Pull over. We've reached.

2015
02:22:59,541 --> 02:23:02,249
Address is of Church and he's
playing role of Jesus.

2016
02:23:02,708 --> 02:23:03,749
What an actor!

2017
02:23:04,583 --> 02:23:05,624
Sir, bye.

2018
02:23:06,166 --> 02:23:07,207
Hold this, my son.

2019
02:23:07,375 --> 02:23:08,540
Sir..-Take care of it.

2020
02:23:08,625 --> 02:23:09,707
Sir..-I'll be back.

2021
02:23:14,458 --> 02:23:15,499
Sir.

2022
02:23:17,125 --> 02:23:18,165
Where did he go?

2023
02:23:18,958 --> 02:23:20,249
I don't even know his name.

2024
02:23:23,041 --> 02:23:24,082
Stop, dear.

2025
02:23:30,125 --> 02:23:31,165
Jesus.

2026
02:23:33,625 --> 02:23:35,249
Jenny! -Prem.

2027
02:23:36,125 --> 02:23:37,165
Jenny!

2028
02:23:42,500 --> 02:23:44,040
Jenny, you're here?

2029
02:23:46,041 --> 02:23:47,082
I..

2030
02:23:48,791 --> 02:23:49,832
You..

2031
02:23:52,958 --> 02:23:57,290
Prem, didn't I fix you in Jenny's
heart permanently?

2032
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:06,540
So this was the strangest
love story of the world..

2033
02:24:07,208 --> 02:24:10,665
..where Prem got Jenny without
saying I love you.

2034
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:12,374
Love story without I love you.

2035
02:24:13,208 --> 02:24:14,957
This is the biggest story.

2036
02:24:15,500 --> 02:24:17,457
And today people of
Madwali have gone..

2037
02:24:17,541 --> 02:24:19,082
..to wedding of our hero, Prem.

2038
02:24:19,208 --> 02:24:20,832
You too go. Move!

2039
02:24:20,916 --> 02:24:23,665
You're not coming.
-You rotten dumb fellow!

2040
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:27,124
If I go, who will stand here?
Your father? -No.

2041
02:24:27,208 --> 02:24:28,832
Or my father? -No. -Go.

2042
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:31,332
Excuse me, sir.

2043
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:35,457
Sorry. I mean thank you, sir.

2044
02:24:38,958 --> 02:24:40,707
Now you two sign here.

First sign.

2046
02:24:43,125 --> 02:24:44,165
Yes.

2047
02:24:45,875 --> 02:24:49,457
Jenny, I wanted to say something
to you. -Go on.

2048
02:24:50,875 --> 02:24:53,249
I love you, Jenny.
Will you be my life partner?

2049
02:24:55,208 --> 02:24:56,290
First sign.

2050
02:24:57,708 --> 02:25:01,332
But you..-First sign here.

2051
02:25:07,833 --> 02:25:09,999
Raju,
I've said I love you to Jenny.

2052
02:25:10,625 --> 02:25:12,957
He has said it now.

2053
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:14,665
If you'd waited 2 years more,
even..

2054
02:25:14,791 --> 02:25:16,207
..your kids would've heard it.

2055
02:25:18,666 --> 02:25:19,832
Garland her.

2056
02:25:31,916 --> 02:25:33,290
What are you doing, shameless?

2057
02:25:33,375 --> 02:25:35,374
Dad, don't give me the look.
It's allowed in Christians.

2058
02:25:35,458 --> 02:25:37,290
Right? -Yes.

2059
02:25:43,458 --> 02:25:45,290
