1
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,977
As incomplete as
the sun without rays...

2
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,710
... And fragrance without breeze...

3
00:03:21,414 --> 00:03:23,314
... ls a ruler without
his Prime Minister.

4
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:28,286
The demise of our Prime Minister,
Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath...

5
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:31,280
... Leaves us with
a pressing question.

6
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:36,519
Who here considers himself
worthy enough to be the next Peshwa?

7
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:42,331
l would accept the post of Peshwa
with great honour, Your Majesty.

8
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:44,029
Your proposal pleases me,
Panth Pratinidhi.

9
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:47,798
Does the court approve?

10
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:48,830
Your Majesty...

11
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,536
The only man that can protect..

12
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:55,813
..the Maratha empire and preserve
the honour of the Peshwa's post...

13
00:03:56,616 --> 00:03:57,947
... is Bajirao!

14
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:29,271
Forgive me, Your Majesty
but this statement mocks the court.

15
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,907
You appear to be the
only one laughing, Minister.

16
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:35,283
Every man has the
right to prove his merit.

17
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:38,917
A son does not inherit his father's
wisdom simply by wearing his turban.

18
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:43,485
Even a sandalwood tree needs time
to age before it produces fragrance.

19
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,727
But even the youngest thorn can prick.
What say?

20
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:52,294
Never doubt the cheetah's speed, the
hawk's vision and Bajirao's sword...

21
00:04:54,608 --> 00:04:56,303
They could outwit you at any moment!

22
00:04:57,844 --> 00:04:59,402
l, Bajirao Ballad...

23
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:04,983
... Son of Late Balaji Vishwanath,
consider myself fit for this post.

24
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:07,742
And for that,
l am willing to pass any test.

25
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:09,778
A test there shall be, Bajirao.

26
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,986
But l shall allow Panth
Pratinidhi to decide it.

27
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:34,703
Prove your marksmanship by splitting
that peacock feather into two, Bajirao.

28
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:38,815
Let your weapons speak of your wisdom.

29
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:42,520
Now let's see some of that
cheetah's speed and hawk's vision...

30
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:32,965
Your Majesty, the challenge was to
split the peacock feather into two halves...

31
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,468
... And the court witnesses that
the feather is still intact.

32
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,308
But shorter than before.

33
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:43,505
Sift through the mud and
you will find the other half there.

34
00:06:50,857 --> 00:06:52,620
That was proof of my marksmanship...

35
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:54,990
... Now for the thought behind it.

36
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:58,727
That soil is lndia and that
peacock feather is the tree..

37
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:01,357
..of the Mughal kingdom
with its roots in Delhi...

38
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:04,466
The arrow is...

39
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:07,238
... The Maratha empire.

40
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:10,576
Strike at the root and
even the biggest tree will fall.

41
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:13,371
You have a brilliant mind, Peshwa!

42
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:48,605
Behold the pride of
the Maratha empire...

43
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:51,407
The righteous and dutiful...

44
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:55,318
Peshwa Bajirao Ballad!

45
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:59,289
Behold!

46
00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:00,343
This story belongs
to an era in history...

47
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:05,652
... When King Shahu Maharaj
held the reins of the Maratha empire.

48
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:10,962
... And his Prime Minister
was Bajirao Ballad.

49
00:09:17,937 --> 00:09:22,374
A sword as swift as lightening...
A will as immovable as the himalayas.

50
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:27,640
The radiance of his clan on his face...
And only one dream in his eyes...

51
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,878
... To see the Maratha flag paint the
skies in Delhi, saffron with victory.

52
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:41,884
ln ten years, Bajirao had captured
half of lndia with his leadership,..

53
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:45,692
..political prowess
and unmatched battle skills.

54
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,562
Stories of Bajirao's
valour made headlines..

55
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:55,767
..from the Nizam in South,
to the Mughals in the north.

56
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:01,774
We shall fulfil King
Shivaji's dream...

57
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:05,306
..Defeat the Mughals
and make lndia a hindu state.

58
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:10,380
Unlike the enemy's
jewels and wealth,..

59
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:12,618
..our treasury is rich with blood,
ready for sacrifice.

60
00:10:16,396 --> 00:10:19,627
We owe our every breath
to the Maratha empire.

61
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:26,428
We are the thunder
in the face of any storm...

62
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:28,940
And we are a sea of
fire in the face of thunder!

63
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,962
Bajirao Ballad shall break
away all shackles of defeat..

64
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:02,507
..and unfurl the
saffron flag in victory.

65
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:07,410
(War Cry)

66
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:55,761
While Bajirao was weilding his sword
to change the map of lndia...

67
00:11:55,895 --> 00:11:58,591
... A magnificent palace,
Shaniwar Wada,

68
00:11:58,664 --> 00:12:01,895
..was being constructed in Pune,
in his honour.

69
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:07,966
(Chants )

70
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:10,002
Kashi, where are you going in
the middle of prayers?

71
00:12:10,276 --> 00:12:11,004
Bhanu has come!

72
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:11,800
Bhanu who?

73
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:14,812
A dear childhood friend...
l'll be right back with her.

74
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:15,905
Be back soon!

75
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:17,415
Yes, right away.

76
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,721
When will Kashi ever learn!

77
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:28,617
Bhanu, when did you arrive?

78
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:31,423
And why are you out here,
you should've come into the prayer service.

79
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:32,930
That's alright.

80
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:36,591
lt's been a while since we last met.
All well, Kashi?

81
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:39,332
Bhanu, when did this happen?

82
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,033
What happened to your husband?

83
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:42,934
He was murdered.

84
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:44,532
By whom?

85
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,440
By the Peshwa.

86
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:47,010
Tread carefully Bhanu!

87
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:48,513
You are accusing the Peshwa of murder!

88
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:49,515
He was accused of being a spy...

89
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:52,416
The Peshwa would
never do such injustice.

90
00:12:57,557 --> 00:12:58,649
What's in this?

91
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:00,017
The Peshwa's justice...

92
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:01,686
... My husband's ashes.

93
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:05,954
Today you sanctify your home...

94
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:08,489
... While mine burns to ashes.

95
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:10,860
l ache for my husband, Kashi.

96
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:13,403
As will you!

97
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:44,301
My Lord, a soldier has come
from Bundelkhand.

98
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:46,301
He has a message from King Chatrasal.

99
00:13:46,606 --> 00:13:47,732
The soldier wishes to meet you.

100
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,035
Does the King wish to offer me
his daughter's hand?

101
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,004
He says Mohammad Bangash's
troops have surrounded his fort...

102
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:55,905
... And he needs our assistance.

103
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:58,746
Are we to fight our own battles
or help the king, Tukoji?

104
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:00,452
We must reach Siraunja.

105
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:01,384
Send the soldier away.

106
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:03,387
But Sir, the soldier is insisting
on meeting the Peshwa.

107
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:05,287
Tukoji, leave!

108
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:06,851
Certainly.

109
00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:10,292
lf we take this valley,
we will reach quicker.

110
00:14:10,696 --> 00:14:12,357
You cannot meet the Peshwa.

111
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:14,491
Stop him! No one must go inside...

112
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:20,996
Panth, please send
her away respectfully.

113
00:15:23,002 --> 00:15:24,367
Bundelkhand is in danger.

114
00:15:24,437 --> 00:15:27,372
The Rajput queens and princesses
are poised to self-immolate.

115
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:29,501
We need your help.

116
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:33,636
When Bundelkhand has a weapon
like you, what help should l be?

117
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:37,041
l cannot help you right now,
please leave.

118
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,488
You may lose your life over this!

119
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:44,784
lt hardly matters.

120
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,918
l swore while leaving
Bundelkhand that..

121
00:15:47,994 --> 00:15:50,588
..l would return only with
Peshwa Bajirao, or not at all.

122
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:55,793
l put forth a plea believing you
to be God, but you aren't even human.

123
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:02,668
What is your name?

124
00:16:03,342 --> 00:16:04,400
Mastani.

125
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:09,680
l like your courage
and your approach...

126
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:11,477
Decamp, Panth.

127
00:16:11,784 --> 00:16:12,842
We ride to Bundelkhand!

128
00:16:13,352 --> 00:16:14,910
But Sir,
what will we tell His Majesty?

129
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:16,682
His Majesty will
be happy to know that..

130
00:16:16,756 --> 00:16:19,281
..one Hindu monarch
is going to help another.

131
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,286
How far is Bundelkhand from here?

132
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:21,792
lt's a five day march.

133
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:23,488
We shall get there in two...
- That's impossible.

134
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:25,291
Let the enemy think that way...

135
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:29,300
Bajirao's fame is carried
by his speed, Mastani...

136
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:32,334
Let's go!

137
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:33,765
Final warning...

138
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:42,366
''...surrender by daybreak or face
dire consequences'' - Mohammad Bangash.

139
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:45,806
No word of help from the Peshwa.

140
00:17:46,645 --> 00:17:48,977
That leaves us only two choices...

141
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:52,017
... Surrender or martyrdom!

142
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:54,013
MARTYRDOM!!

143
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:04,654
Ruhani Begum! What's going on?

144
00:18:05,598 --> 00:18:09,967
My king, if enemy
breaches the fort walls...

145
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:13,933
... The women shall surrender to
this fire, to safeguard our dignity!

146
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:15,940
My king!

147
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:18,340
l see torchlights
coming in from the East!!

148
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:21,312
That must be Mastani
arriving with help.

149
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:54,878
General! An army approaches
from beyond those hills.

150
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:01,419
Swerve the cannons!

151
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:17,963
We've been tricked! About-face...
Head back!

152
00:19:18,237 --> 00:19:21,673
There is no army here...
lt's just cattle!

153
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:28,343
We have managed to trick them!

154
00:19:28,414 --> 00:19:29,904
Their cannons have been swerved.

155
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:33,509
Mastani, reach inside the fort through
the secret tunnel...

156
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:35,519
... And signal me once inside.

157
00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:39,415
We'll be ready for attack.

158
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:06,943
Mastani!

159
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:08,509
The Maratha army is here, father.

160
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:11,954
Bundelkhand is forever indebted to you...
- There is no debt in duty, father.

161
00:20:12,024 --> 00:20:15,050
Go ahead and declare war,
l'll signal the Peshwa.

162
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,689
(War Cry)

163
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:39,903
Attack!

164
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:26,868
Congratulations on
your victory, Peshwa.

165
00:25:26,939 --> 00:25:30,033
l wish you and Mastani the same.
How is she now?

166
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:32,800
Wounded, yet grateful.

167
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:36,310
l don't know how
l can repay this debt.

168
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:40,408
l seek no reward, dear King...

169
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:46,684
All l ask for, is the permission to
bid farewell. l must reach Siraunja.

170
00:25:46,758 --> 00:25:48,783
l won't hear of it!

171
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:51,489
You must celebrate this Holi
(festival of colours ) with us!

172
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:55,295
My lady, it appears you've truly
been playing Holi ...

173
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:57,927
... And with none
other than the Peshwa.

174
00:25:58,971 --> 00:26:01,940
He carried you here in his arms,
wounded and unconscious...

175
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:06,000
... But even in that state you were
entwined with him as though one body.

176
00:26:06,812 --> 00:26:08,871
Congratulations on this
victorious morning, My Lady.

177
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:11,347
l would like a few moments alone
with Mastani Saheba.

178
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:12,280
Leave us...

179
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:15,514
These are my personal chambers,
Peshwa... Not your battleground.

180
00:26:15,988 --> 00:26:18,548
One needs my permission to leave.

181
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:25,487
l said... No one leaves without
my permission.

182
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:29,333
Besides, it could be dangerous being
alone with you.

183
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:30,967
ls that so!
Do you not trust me, My Lady?

184
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:32,628
l'm afraid it's myself l don't trust.

185
00:26:32,704 --> 00:26:36,037
My Rajput blood could make me
avenge your assault.

186
00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:37,673
You have every right.

187
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:39,466
l owe you my life.

188
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:40,977
l owe you my homeland.

189
00:26:41,046 --> 00:26:43,674
l would give even
my life for you, Mastani.

190
00:26:45,317 --> 00:26:47,717
lt appears this account must be
settled in private after all!

191
00:26:57,429 --> 00:26:59,397
You deserve to be praised,
Mastani Saheba...

192
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:03,997
... My sword has never spared
a foe on the battlefield,..

193
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:05,964
..but somehow you escaped its wrath.

194
00:27:07,005 --> 00:27:09,735
l believe your wound is deep.

195
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,339
Let me see it.

196
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:15,340
Rajputs do not make
a show of their wounds.

197
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,518
To others,
this may be a battle scar...

198
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:31,494
... But for me,
you are the moon bathed in colour.

199
00:27:40,505 --> 00:27:42,996
The poison had to be
stopped from spreading.

200
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:46,739
l've seen your wounds, Mastani...

201
00:27:47,346 --> 00:27:49,746
... You are no longer a Rajput.

202
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:55,882
What you see is merely
the mark of your sword.

203
00:27:57,823 --> 00:28:00,451
But it is my heart that bleeds.

204
00:28:03,528 --> 00:28:05,758
Even the Peshwa has a heart!

205
00:29:09,528 --> 00:29:14,989
'' On this festival of colours ''

206
00:29:15,267 --> 00:29:19,328
Paint me red in the colour of love.

207
00:29:19,404 --> 00:29:25,968
Oh you playful one,
like Lord Krishna.

208
00:29:31,683 --> 00:29:37,280
l'm mesmerised looking at you...

209
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:50,696
Hold me close,
instead of looking from afar...

210
00:30:36,882 --> 00:30:42,445
Playfully you twist my arm...

211
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:46,457
Like Lord Krishna with Radha.

212
00:30:57,502 --> 00:31:01,461
And when l protest, you embrace me...

213
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:07,001
You refuse to let go of me...

214
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,690
'' Blushing l turn red...
The colour of love. ''

215
00:32:22,053 --> 00:32:27,514
Fortune favours the brave, My Lady...
And fortunate you are, indeed!

216
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,692
The Peshwa has asked for
a paan (after meal delicacy).

217
00:32:30,762 --> 00:32:32,992
Here, it is your excuse to see him.

218
00:32:33,064 --> 00:32:34,759
l no longer need excuses.

219
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:37,801
This dagger?

220
00:32:38,603 --> 00:32:39,592
The Peshwa gave it to me!

221
00:32:39,704 --> 00:32:41,501
Dear God! And you accepted it?

222
00:32:41,873 --> 00:32:44,341
Don't you know that as per
the custom in Bundelkhand...

223
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:47,742
... A girl is married to
a man by accepting his dagger!

224
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,374
Did you accept it?

225
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:53,878
l accepted it.

226
00:32:53,952 --> 00:32:55,442
And he?

227
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:19,877
Your paan.

228
00:33:23,014 --> 00:33:24,413
And if l weren't awake?

229
00:33:24,783 --> 00:33:26,546
l would will the night
to go on for eternity...

230
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,918
... And gaze upon you forever.

231
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:30,750
But that is impossible.

232
00:33:31,356 --> 00:33:33,950
Time and destiny cannot
be controlled by mortals.

233
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:37,961
What cannot be controlled by mortals
can be swayed by the power of love.

234
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:41,521
So can love stop the sun from rising?

235
00:33:59,517 --> 00:34:00,643
lt just did.

236
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:05,986
Do have your paan,
or my hospitality might be questioned.

237
00:34:07,926 --> 00:34:10,258
Mastani, l shall be gone tomorrow.

238
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:11,526
What of it?

239
00:34:11,963 --> 00:34:13,988
Perhaps we may never meet again.

240
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:17,628
You are in my heart, like a prayer.

241
00:34:19,871 --> 00:34:22,339
The mention of your
name shall be my worship...

242
00:34:58,543 --> 00:35:00,602
My Lady, the Peshwa is leaving!

243
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:04,713
Entire Bundelkhand has gathered for
his farewell, except you.

244
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:06,007
Come, My Lady!

245
00:35:07,685 --> 00:35:09,744
Such arrogance does
not become you, My Lady.

246
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:12,951
You mistake love for arrogance.

247
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,958
What sort of love is this?
He is leaving, and you...

248
00:35:15,026 --> 00:35:18,621
Watching him go will
be the death of me.

249
00:35:18,696 --> 00:35:21,494
God forbid! But this meeting
will be left incomplete.

250
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:24,626
An incomplete meeting leaves
the promise of another.

251
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:27,703
And what if destiny doesn't allow it?

252
00:35:30,008 --> 00:35:32,806
Mastani writes her own destiny.

253
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:59,995
We may be greatly
indebted to the Peshwa...

254
00:36:00,405 --> 00:36:03,670
But l refuse to send our daughter
to Pune as an obligation, My King.

255
00:36:04,008 --> 00:36:07,239
l understand that our marriage
has never been valid in the society...

256
00:36:07,312 --> 00:36:08,711
... Because l am
Muslim and you're Hindu.

257
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,714
lt is my own decision to go to Pune...

258
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:13,910
l am wed to the Peshwa's dagger.

259
00:36:13,985 --> 00:36:17,785
This is a custom in Bundelkhand,
not Pune.

260
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:22,317
And do not forget that the Peshwa
is Hindu Brahmin and you are Muslim.

261
00:36:22,393 --> 00:36:25,294
Mastani has Hindu Rajput blood too.

262
00:36:25,997 --> 00:36:28,966
She worships Allah and Krishna alike.

263
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:31,859
Jodha and Akbar put aside religious
differences in the name of politics.

264
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:34,302
Mastani is doing the same,
but for love.

265
00:36:34,806 --> 00:36:36,000
Let her go.

266
00:36:36,274 --> 00:36:38,936
Even so! He will never accept
her as his legitimate wife.

267
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,910
Radha was never Lord Krishna's wife...

268
00:36:41,379 --> 00:36:43,745
... But their names are inseparable.

269
00:36:44,382 --> 00:36:45,474
Yes, but they are Gods!

270
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,017
And love is worship...

271
00:36:48,286 --> 00:36:50,880
... For which one needs no permission.

272
00:36:57,595 --> 00:36:59,688
May God fulfill your wishes!

273
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:04,597
Stay blessed!

274
00:37:31,362 --> 00:37:35,765
My beautiful love has returned...

275
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:39,950
Praise the Lord!

276
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:57,001
A moment, My Lady...

277
00:39:57,308 --> 00:39:58,900
... You have not taken my
name this time. (Marathi tradition)

278
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,874
Why, brother!

279
00:39:59,944 --> 00:40:01,434
lt's a new era!
New palace, new customs.

280
00:40:01,512 --> 00:40:03,412
Why must the lady always
take the man's name?

281
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:08,475
You take her name this time,
or else no entering your new chambers!

282
00:40:08,553 --> 00:40:12,011
But it is a custom for women
to say their husbands' name...

283
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:19,986
No diamond can match the Kohinoor's
sparkle and grace.

284
00:40:20,064 --> 00:40:24,057
And no name but Bajirao's
lights up Kashi's face.

285
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:27,070
Very good!

286
00:40:29,941 --> 00:40:31,431
This way, Peshwa Saheb.

287
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:32,806
My Lady...

288
00:40:32,877 --> 00:40:34,606
You are entering your new chambers
for the first time.

289
00:40:34,712 --> 00:40:35,701
What childishness is this!

290
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:38,475
You swore on me...

291
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:41,712
... So don't open
your eyes until l say so!

292
00:40:42,787 --> 00:40:43,879
Don't you trust me?

293
00:40:43,955 --> 00:40:46,048
Trust a warrior?

294
00:40:46,457 --> 00:40:48,425
You never know when he may attack!

295
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,028
Now, open your eyes.

296
00:40:51,429 --> 00:40:52,088
What do you think?

297
00:40:52,597 --> 00:40:53,689
Beautiful!!

298
00:40:55,466 --> 00:41:00,062
This is nothing compared to the
rest of Shanivaar Wada.

299
00:41:08,746 --> 00:41:10,873
Tell me something, My Lady...

300
00:41:11,382 --> 00:41:12,406
What?

301
00:41:12,884 --> 00:41:16,047
How come l still see it in your eyes?

302
00:41:16,687 --> 00:41:17,312
What?

303
00:41:17,388 --> 00:41:18,377
Longing!

304
00:41:18,456 --> 00:41:22,859
Because it keeps me company
in your long absences.

305
00:41:23,461 --> 00:41:25,429
Oh dear... Where is it?

306
00:41:25,897 --> 00:41:26,659
What?

307
00:41:26,731 --> 00:41:28,722
Your mistress!!

308
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,665
Your dagger?

309
00:41:31,836 --> 00:41:33,463
Just as well you've forgotten it.

310
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:35,534
lt will no longer come between us.

311
00:41:39,911 --> 00:41:43,438
Have l offended you by
calling your dagger a mistress?

312
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:47,384
l talk too much!

313
00:41:50,788 --> 00:41:53,518
King Chatrasaal has
showered us with gifts.

314
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,383
l am pleased!

315
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,792
The timing couldn't
have been better...

316
00:41:59,764 --> 00:42:02,426
Expenses had been piling up.

317
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:05,759
So helping Bundelkhand
has proved profitable for us.

318
00:42:07,705 --> 00:42:08,729
What is this?

319
00:42:34,699 --> 00:42:37,395
Who are you?

320
00:42:37,768 --> 00:42:39,565
This is King Chatrasaal's daughter.

321
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:43,071
l wasn't aware he had
such a beautiful daughter.

322
00:42:43,841 --> 00:42:45,775
l 'm very pleased to
make your acquaintance.

323
00:42:46,043 --> 00:42:47,806
As am l, thank you!

324
00:42:48,045 --> 00:42:49,410
What is your name?

325
00:42:49,947 --> 00:42:50,845
Mastani.

326
00:42:51,048 --> 00:42:53,312
Mastani... Beautiful name.

327
00:42:54,485 --> 00:42:58,319
Your father has many wives,
whose daughter are you?

328
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:02,391
Ruhani Begum's.

329
00:43:03,394 --> 00:43:04,725
l see, you are a Muslim.

330
00:43:04,862 --> 00:43:08,662
King Chatrasaal needn't
have sent his daughter..

331
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:11,861
..all the way here
simply to deliver gifts!

332
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:14,631
What say, Chimaji?

333
00:43:21,012 --> 00:43:22,809
This dagger belongs to Bajirao!

334
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:27,781
ln Bundelkhand we observe a custom
where girls are wed to daggers.

335
00:43:30,288 --> 00:43:34,349
Perhaps amongst Muslims and Rajputs.

336
00:43:34,425 --> 00:43:37,826
ln the Peshwa regime, we do not
accept such political ties.

337
00:43:37,895 --> 00:43:39,886
But l am already married to him!

338
00:43:42,934 --> 00:43:46,392
Chimaji, please make arrangements
for her stay elsewhere.

339
00:43:46,537 --> 00:43:50,803
Do meet me before you
return to Bundelkhand.

340
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:01,951
My dear...

341
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:04,385
lf you stare any longer,
you will cast an evil eye on me.

342
00:44:04,455 --> 00:44:07,253
l am trying to remove it.

343
00:45:45,122 --> 00:45:46,555
Going to war?

344
00:45:46,624 --> 00:45:47,921
l have decided...

345
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:50,687
Next time,
l shall accompany you to war.

346
00:45:50,861 --> 00:45:52,419
No matter what anyone says.

347
00:45:53,497 --> 00:45:55,965
But you cannot ride a horse.
How do you expect to come?

348
00:45:56,033 --> 00:45:59,969
l'll go to the stable, mount my horse,
crack the whip...

349
00:46:00,037 --> 00:46:02,597
... And be off like the wind.
Here comes Kashi!!

350
00:46:12,783 --> 00:46:15,308
We haven't even reached the
battlefield yet and you've started.

351
00:46:15,386 --> 00:46:17,684
What else does this warrior need?

352
00:46:18,355 --> 00:46:22,382
A bit of land, two square meals, a
piece of open sky, a steed, a sword...

353
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,688
... And my Kashi.

354
00:46:23,994 --> 00:46:25,928
Altogether, twenty-seven.

355
00:46:25,996 --> 00:46:26,963
How so?

356
00:46:27,298 --> 00:46:28,765
Twenty-seven wounds!

357
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:33,493
And this time you let
the enemy get too close...

358
00:46:33,871 --> 00:46:35,668
And now to avoid the
twenty-eighth wound...

359
00:46:36,006 --> 00:46:40,443
... This ring will protect
you from both the evil eye..

360
00:46:40,511 --> 00:46:42,775
and the enemy's sword.

361
00:46:49,553 --> 00:46:52,954
My Lady, l do not trust
the intentions of those people.

362
00:46:53,557 --> 00:46:55,889
These are no guests' chambers!

363
00:46:56,026 --> 00:46:58,426
lt's a strategy to demean you.

364
00:46:59,029 --> 00:47:00,826
lf they can put you
up amonst courtesans,..

365
00:47:00,898 --> 00:47:02,525
..they can ask you to
dance at their court next!

366
00:47:03,767 --> 00:47:04,791
My Lady!

367
00:47:06,604 --> 00:47:08,970
Well, well...
Look at the butterfly!

368
00:47:10,941 --> 00:47:14,843
My lady, it was unwise
to send our soldiers home.

369
00:47:15,646 --> 00:47:17,671
We are in a strange land,
surrounded by strangers.

370
00:47:17,748 --> 00:47:19,340
You never know what
problems might arise.

371
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:23,977
What kind of people would house
a guest amongst courtesans.

372
00:47:24,421 --> 00:47:26,389
And that too the daughter
of King Chatrasaal.

373
00:47:26,624 --> 00:47:29,252
Swords would be raised in Bundelkhand
if they caught wind of this.

374
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,621
Yet you sit here silently...

375
00:48:07,998 --> 00:48:10,432
l know you feel humiliated, My Lady.

376
00:48:12,703 --> 00:48:15,695
Let us return home rather
than be insulted here.

377
00:48:15,973 --> 00:48:18,806
lf he truly loves you, the Peshwa
will come after you, to Bundelkhand.

378
00:48:19,743 --> 00:48:22,940
One more thing,
no matter your efforts...

379
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,941
... They will never
let him learn you are here.

380
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,516
And l will never let
them forget my love for him.

381
00:48:38,762 --> 00:48:41,925
My Lord, you are now witnessing the
most beautiful section of Shanivaar Wada...

382
00:48:41,999 --> 00:48:43,261
The Palace of Mirrors.

383
00:48:43,434 --> 00:48:44,423
Whoa, Chimaji...

384
00:48:45,703 --> 00:48:46,897
... lt's unreal!

385
00:48:47,738 --> 00:48:50,332
While you have been busy fighting
our enemies for years...

386
00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:51,897
... Your brother
has been building this.

387
00:48:52,042 --> 00:48:54,806
Chimaji, you have brought
the Taj Mahal to Pune.

388
00:48:54,878 --> 00:48:58,405
And you shall witness the true
splendour of this place tonight...

389
00:48:58,482 --> 00:48:59,915
When we celebrate the New Year.

390
00:48:59,984 --> 00:49:02,350
Truly this is a dreamworld, brother.

391
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:06,250
The true magic of this dreamworld
lies in the wonder at your feet.

392
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:07,652
How do you mean?

393
00:49:07,725 --> 00:49:09,784
At this very moment Bajirao,
if Kashi desires..

394
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,794
..she can see you and
Nana from her chambers.

395
00:49:12,229 --> 00:49:15,665
Are you saying Kashi can see both father
and son from the comfort of her room?

396
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:16,825
Therein lies the magic!

397
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,595
That lotus has a
mechanism that makes..

398
00:49:18,669 --> 00:49:20,796
..your reflection shine
from these mirrors...

399
00:49:20,938 --> 00:49:24,374
... Straight onto the
little window in Kashi's room.

400
00:49:24,441 --> 00:49:25,999
My Lady!!

401
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:30,268
There's a beam coming
through the window.

402
00:49:30,347 --> 00:49:30,972
Really!

403
00:49:31,248 --> 00:49:34,775
Yes, really, come on, come quickly!

404
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:45,626
Then traveling through
the glass on the water,..

405
00:49:45,696 --> 00:49:47,857
..it reflects onto the
curtain in her chambers.

406
00:49:51,935 --> 00:49:54,495
Quickly, My Lady, quickly!

407
00:49:54,571 --> 00:49:57,005
Wait a moment!

408
00:50:00,978 --> 00:50:04,505
Oh! We can see Bajirao here although
he's in the Palace of Mirrors.

409
00:50:04,581 --> 00:50:05,809
lt's magic!

410
00:50:05,883 --> 00:50:09,944
Just look at how
handsome our Bajirao is.

411
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:13,053
Hey! Stop casting the evil eye on him.

412
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,290
A sister can never cast
an evil eye on her brother.

413
00:50:15,492 --> 00:50:18,518
But l've heard the Nawab's wives yearn
to set eyes on him.

414
00:50:18,595 --> 00:50:21,894
l've heard they would gladly pay his
weight in gold for a glimpse of him.

415
00:50:21,965 --> 00:50:24,729
Let them pay his weight in diamonds
if they want...

416
00:50:24,802 --> 00:50:27,896
... My Bajirao has never
so much as looked at another woman.

417
00:50:28,472 --> 00:50:29,905
Understood!

418
00:50:38,415 --> 00:50:40,747
Like an angel descended from heaven...

419
00:50:46,056 --> 00:50:50,686
Her tresses exuding
a divine fragrance...

420
00:51:17,921 --> 00:51:24,918
Here she comes... A vision in gold.

421
00:51:44,415 --> 00:51:50,615
l am intoxicated by your love

422
00:52:08,005 --> 00:52:14,410
My love is no secret

423
00:52:14,478 --> 00:52:23,011
The world tried to stop me,
but look where love brought me...

424
00:52:23,287 --> 00:52:29,851
They say Mastani is
intoxicated by your love...

425
00:53:35,392 --> 00:53:41,422
First, you wounded my heart...

426
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:53,441
Then, you healed it with your love...

427
00:53:59,516 --> 00:54:04,977
'' Your love has become my identity...''

428
00:54:13,764 --> 00:54:20,033
And loving you is my purpose.

429
00:54:59,042 --> 00:55:02,375
Every corner is illuminated
by your beauty...

430
00:55:11,555 --> 00:55:14,547
You are indeed intoxicated by love,
Mastani...

431
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:17,526
Your soul is pure and your love,
divine...

432
00:56:22,259 --> 00:56:26,355
You have been aptly named Mastani,
one who dances to her own tune.

433
00:56:27,698 --> 00:56:31,464
l'm surprised but happy
to see you here in Pune.

434
00:56:32,736 --> 00:56:36,672
This paan...
A token of my hospitality.

435
00:56:45,348 --> 00:56:47,816
We shall meet tomorrow.

436
00:57:30,527 --> 00:57:34,258
Your capabilities greatly
exceed my expectations.

437
00:57:34,865 --> 00:57:36,492
You are a talented dancer.

438
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,467
Thank you.

439
00:57:38,668 --> 00:57:42,331
Please pay me a further compliment,
accept my alliance.

440
00:57:42,873 --> 00:57:44,738
Of course l have.

441
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:53,440
You are now allied with the kingdom
as a court dancer.

442
00:57:53,984 --> 00:57:57,886
Very soon you will dance at
the king's court in the capital.

443
00:57:58,355 --> 00:58:00,880
Do you not like my offering?

444
00:58:00,957 --> 00:58:05,951
l cherish your every offering,
be it an anklet or a son...

445
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:10,663
... The more you try to distance him
from me, the closer l shall get to him.

446
00:58:10,734 --> 00:58:12,861
Then keep trying endlessly.

447
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:19,540
A dancer's place is always below
the throne, on the court's floor.

448
00:58:20,844 --> 00:58:25,247
l have always been
complimented on my beauty...

449
00:58:26,283 --> 00:58:27,944
... Today watching a woman of..

450
00:58:28,618 --> 00:58:31,985
..your standing
threatened by it, makes me proud.

451
00:58:34,658 --> 00:58:37,422
Prepare to leave for the Capital.

452
00:58:42,999 --> 00:58:45,559
lt appears no one has sobered from
last night's performance.

453
00:58:45,702 --> 00:58:48,694
Look around,
not a soul wishes to work!

454
00:58:48,772 --> 00:58:52,902
What is a warrior before whom a beauty
is not compelled to lower her gaze...

455
00:58:53,376 --> 00:58:56,504
What is a beauty before whom a warrior
is not compelled to lower his sword?

456
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:59,777
Bravo, Peshwa!... Well said!

457
00:58:59,916 --> 00:59:04,580
The brave Chimaji is here!

458
00:59:04,788 --> 00:59:07,689
Chimaji your presence indicates
our campaigns have been audited.

459
00:59:07,757 --> 00:59:09,691
What is the outcome?

460
00:59:09,759 --> 00:59:12,284
Discounting endowments
from Bundelkhand,..

461
00:59:12,362 --> 00:59:15,456
..none of the three campaigns
have enriched our treasury.

462
00:59:15,532 --> 00:59:17,625
This is where you are wrong, brother.

463
00:59:17,968 --> 00:59:19,629
How have we not been enriched?

464
00:59:19,703 --> 00:59:23,298
First - the glory of victory.

465
00:59:25,809 --> 00:59:28,744
Second - shaming Bangash with defeat.

466
00:59:28,979 --> 00:59:32,346
Third - tolling the
Maratha bell in Delhi.

467
00:59:34,384 --> 00:59:38,411
Fourth - the saffron flag once again
stands strong against the blue sky.

468
00:59:38,488 --> 00:59:42,686
Praise the lord!

469
00:59:42,759 --> 00:59:46,388
And fifth - a lifetime's
bond with Bundelkhand.

470
00:59:46,463 --> 00:59:49,455
And sixth, My Lord, you forget!

471
00:59:49,532 --> 00:59:53,559
A splendid dancer like
Mastani to entertain us!

472
01:00:03,413 --> 01:00:06,644
Chimaji, see to it our hospitality towards
Mastani Saheba is in no way lacking.

473
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:08,943
Of course... Rest assured l will.

474
01:00:09,352 --> 01:00:10,876
She's lodged at Hirabagh Palace.

475
01:00:10,954 --> 01:00:13,013
Send a messenger to tell her
l shall visit this evening.

476
01:00:16,026 --> 01:00:16,993
That won't be possible.

477
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:17,958
Why?

478
01:00:18,028 --> 01:00:19,689
Because you must leave for
the capital today, My Lord.

479
01:00:19,763 --> 01:00:21,025
l can do that tomorrow.

480
01:00:21,298 --> 01:00:24,426
His Majesty awaits you, you
must present yourself there on time.

481
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:26,526
You... Fool!

482
01:00:26,603 --> 01:00:29,800
Reign in your tongue... Understood?

483
01:00:33,076 --> 01:00:36,842
To the capital!

484
01:00:49,025 --> 01:00:50,549
Welcome, Bajirao.

485
01:00:50,927 --> 01:00:52,451
You were impatiently awaited.

486
01:00:52,529 --> 01:00:55,089
You summoned and here l am,
Your Majesty.

487
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,597
Congratulations on Bundelkhand!

488
01:00:59,469 --> 01:01:03,667
l had this sword of Afghan iron
forged in your honour.

489
01:01:04,441 --> 01:01:05,806
l am honoured.

490
01:01:06,843 --> 01:01:12,281
My King, now permit me to use this sword
to bring Delhi to its knees before you.

491
01:01:12,349 --> 01:01:14,817
This is not the right time to attack
Delhi, politically speaking -

492
01:01:14,884 --> 01:01:18,285
My instincts say now is the time,
your Majesty.

493
01:01:18,722 --> 01:01:20,952
Delhi is submerged
in a haze of debauchery.

494
01:01:21,024 --> 01:01:22,958
The Mughal emperor's
court has lost his faith.

495
01:01:23,026 --> 01:01:27,019
We have to appease the Nizam in the
South, to get to Delhi, in the north.

496
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:29,295
There is such a thing
as political diplomacy.

497
01:01:31,835 --> 01:01:33,325
Minister has a point, Peshwa.

498
01:01:33,403 --> 01:01:35,803
That step must be taken
after much forethought.

499
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:39,440
We shall discuss other matters
after this evening's soire.

500
01:01:45,815 --> 01:01:48,340
This sword is best
left in its sheath, Peshwa.

501
01:01:48,785 --> 01:01:51,811
Since you won't be going to Delhi,
what enemy's neck would you place it on?

502
01:01:54,024 --> 01:01:55,821
The Peshwa doesn't lack enemies.

503
01:01:55,892 --> 01:01:57,723
Don't move.

504
01:01:58,061 --> 01:02:00,029
Your neck is very valuable,..

505
01:02:00,096 --> 01:02:02,758
..and more delicate than
this string of pearls around it.

506
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:19,740
As you already know...
Never doubt the cheetah's speed,..

507
01:02:19,816 --> 01:02:21,647
..the hawk's vision
and Bajirao's sword...

508
01:02:22,485 --> 01:02:23,816
... They can outwit you any time.

509
01:02:38,401 --> 01:02:40,062
Why is Mastani Saheba here?

510
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:43,439
Your mother has sent her
as tonight's entertainment.

511
01:02:50,447 --> 01:02:51,778
Let the entertainment begin.

512
01:02:59,722 --> 01:03:02,316
You are a court dancer,
here to entertain.

513
01:03:02,392 --> 01:03:04,292
lnstead you are
dishonouring the court.

514
01:03:04,694 --> 01:03:07,288
l am not dishonouring the court,
but upholding my own honour.

515
01:03:07,564 --> 01:03:08,360
Who are you?

516
01:03:10,366 --> 01:03:10,923
Mastani.

517
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,991
She is a gift from Bundelkhand.

518
01:03:13,937 --> 01:03:17,395
She lit up the Peshwa's palace
with her performance during New Year.

519
01:03:17,474 --> 01:03:19,339
That was a valid occasion...

520
01:03:19,709 --> 01:03:21,006
... This is but a soire.

521
01:03:21,444 --> 01:03:24,004
She is no court dancer but King..

522
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,339
..Chatrasaal's daughter
and a guest of the Peshwa realm.

523
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:29,544
A rather special guest, it appears.

524
01:03:29,719 --> 01:03:31,050
Yes she is, Minister!

525
01:03:31,321 --> 01:03:33,380
Thanks to her the Peshwa is alive..

526
01:03:33,456 --> 01:03:36,482
..and thanks to the Peshwa
the Maratha realm is alive!

527
01:03:38,027 --> 01:03:39,289
Your Majesty...

528
01:03:40,363 --> 01:03:42,923
She does not belong in this court.
Allow her to leave.

529
01:03:43,533 --> 01:03:44,864
The Peshwa is right.

530
01:03:45,301 --> 01:03:46,893
You have saved his life...

531
01:03:47,871 --> 01:03:49,498
... How can l repay you?

532
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:52,831
You will not be able to
fulfill my wish, Your Majesty.

533
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:55,436
What wish is this,
that a king cannot fulfill?

534
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:59,741
The Peshwa!

535
01:04:04,754 --> 01:04:12,024
l salute your courage in asking for
what the Maratha kingdom values most.

536
01:04:12,795 --> 01:04:16,424
But you could be
punished for this demand.

537
01:04:18,501 --> 01:04:24,929
l lay my life, at the sword of thee.
lf love is a crime, punish me!

538
01:04:26,809 --> 01:04:34,409
And yet, if thee hold me wrong,
Erase my name like an untold song.

539
01:04:34,984 --> 01:04:36,349
Well spoken!

540
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,650
You may leave, Mastani.

541
01:05:00,043 --> 01:05:02,910
Don't anchor the boat,
l need to cross the river!

542
01:05:02,979 --> 01:05:05,504
My Lord, the water levels
have risen alarmingly.

543
01:05:05,615 --> 01:05:09,779
l'd have to bear huge losses in taking
the boat out in this weather!!

544
01:05:14,324 --> 01:05:15,985
That should suffice.

545
01:05:42,652 --> 01:05:46,053
Looks like the storm won't abate,
My Lady. Let's return to Bundelkhand.

546
01:05:46,322 --> 01:05:48,290
Our coming here has been in vain.

547
01:05:48,358 --> 01:05:50,588
ln Pune, they kept
us amongst courtesans...

548
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:55,925
... And here in the capital,
across the river, amongst these ruins!

549
01:05:56,733 --> 01:05:58,064
lt frightens me to think...

550
01:05:58,334 --> 01:06:01,895
... The man whose dagger you wed
is unaware of this tradition.

551
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:05,972
What if he refuses to
accept your relationship?

552
01:06:08,278 --> 01:06:09,870
Let me test the power of my love.

553
01:06:10,013 --> 01:06:12,743
You needn't... Anymore!

554
01:06:12,815 --> 01:06:15,306
You had demanded the Peshwa
before the whole court...

555
01:06:15,785 --> 01:06:17,719
... Here he is!

556
01:06:22,458 --> 01:06:24,722
l must say...

557
01:06:24,794 --> 01:06:28,992
... You have sacrificed everything
over a marriage l was not even aware of!

558
01:06:29,932 --> 01:06:31,900
What justifies this madness?

559
01:06:32,769 --> 01:06:33,827
Love...

560
01:06:35,371 --> 01:06:38,738
... That battles stormy waters.

561
01:06:39,942 --> 01:06:43,537
Love, that bows down before no one.

562
01:06:44,347 --> 01:06:48,010
Love, that worships
its beloved above all else.

563
01:06:50,586 --> 01:06:53,953
This society will never accept you!

564
01:06:54,023 --> 01:06:57,720
Loving me will be like
walking on hot embers.

565
01:06:58,594 --> 01:06:59,583
l accept.

566
01:06:59,696 --> 01:07:01,891
My wife's name is Kashi.

567
01:07:02,532 --> 01:07:04,830
She will always be my first wife.

568
01:07:04,901 --> 01:07:06,994
l can never belong only to you.

569
01:07:08,438 --> 01:07:10,303
l accept.

570
01:07:10,373 --> 01:07:14,639
lnsisting on adding my name to yours
will bring you nothing but shame.

571
01:07:15,478 --> 01:07:16,968
l accept.

572
01:07:24,821 --> 01:07:30,623
By the fire of the earth, the sky and
my being, l take you to be my wife.

573
01:07:31,394 --> 01:07:34,659
Even if this society shuns us,
the world will always remember us as one...

574
01:07:35,765 --> 01:07:37,892
Bajirao Mastani

575
01:07:55,651 --> 01:07:58,677
Mapping out your
meeting with the Nizam?

576
01:08:00,056 --> 01:08:02,752
Ensure you wear this when you go.

577
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:07,861
Bajirao, this ring has cost us dearly.

578
01:08:08,498 --> 01:08:10,432
We have paid for it twice.

579
01:08:10,967 --> 01:08:15,427
First to the jeweller
and then to the boatman.

580
01:08:28,785 --> 01:08:34,815
My Lord, the snake seems
prepared to strike us.

581
01:08:35,324 --> 01:08:37,918
The Nizam comes with
twenty-thousand soldiers.

582
01:08:38,261 --> 01:08:39,956
We are heavily outnumbered.

583
01:08:40,029 --> 01:08:43,294
But he doesn't know that.

584
01:08:45,001 --> 01:08:49,301
Not all battles are
fought with weapons...

585
01:08:49,705 --> 01:08:53,869
... Sometimes a sharp mind is enough.

586
01:09:03,853 --> 01:09:05,821
Welcome, King Bajirao!

587
01:09:05,888 --> 01:09:08,288
Have a seat!

588
01:09:08,591 --> 01:09:09,615
Namaste!

589
01:09:10,393 --> 01:09:15,387
You mistake me for royalty when l am
but a humble servant to King Shahu.

590
01:09:15,665 --> 01:09:20,227
Perhaps... But it is well known,
you are the mind that runs the empire.

591
01:09:20,837 --> 01:09:23,271
Some sherbet?

592
01:09:23,406 --> 01:09:24,464
Thank you.

593
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:26,799
l am more interested
in your sweet talk.

594
01:09:26,876 --> 01:09:31,313
l often tell people that
in the Maratha empire...

595
01:09:31,747 --> 01:09:34,716
After the great King
Shivaji and King Shambhu...

596
01:09:34,784 --> 01:09:39,448
There is only Bajirao...
Rest are all fools!

597
01:09:39,555 --> 01:09:44,390
l'm also of the opinion that Nizam is
the strongest in all of South...

598
01:09:44,827 --> 01:09:46,624
Rest are all weak and meek!

599
01:09:46,696 --> 01:09:52,635
l'm impressed...
Your tongue is as sharp as your sword.

600
01:09:52,735 --> 01:09:54,703
And your intentions
are as shrewd as your eyes.

601
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:57,830
My intention is to capture you.

602
01:09:57,907 --> 01:10:00,432
Even the youngest
child in Pune knows that.

603
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:02,535
Yet here you are a willing hostage.

604
01:10:02,645 --> 01:10:07,742
l am under oath to retaliate if
you breach the terms of this meeting.

605
01:10:07,817 --> 01:10:12,049
Are you threatening
me under my own roof?

606
01:10:12,321 --> 01:10:13,982
Cautioning, not threatening...

607
01:10:14,056 --> 01:10:17,048
... One wrong turn
and your kingdom will burn.

608
01:10:18,895 --> 01:10:20,328
Arrest him!

609
01:10:22,865 --> 01:10:26,028
l said, arrest him!

610
01:10:26,736 --> 01:10:29,864
l'm amazed you would order my
own men to capture me!

611
01:10:30,473 --> 01:10:32,703
The men you sent to escort me here
preferred our living quarters.

612
01:10:32,775 --> 01:10:35,369
They decided to stay back.

613
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:36,911
Peshwa, do not forget...

614
01:10:36,979 --> 01:10:39,675
That your army of 20,000 men...

615
01:10:40,783 --> 01:10:43,013
... Horses and elephants,
stands guard outside.

616
01:10:43,085 --> 01:10:48,785
... But what you do not know is that
40,000 Maratha soldiers stand behind them...

617
01:10:48,858 --> 01:10:51,588
... Awaiting my signal
to decimate you.

618
01:10:54,063 --> 01:10:55,724
What do you want?

619
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:02,564
All of lndia.

620
01:11:06,943 --> 01:11:07,967
But for now, your silence.

621
01:11:08,044 --> 01:11:11,377
When l march on Delhi,
you will not utter a word.

622
01:11:12,815 --> 01:11:13,645
l accept.

623
01:11:13,716 --> 01:11:14,648
Secondly...

624
01:11:15,384 --> 01:11:19,480
...You shall return all captured
Maratha estates to our King.

625
01:11:19,755 --> 01:11:20,653
l accept.

626
01:11:20,723 --> 01:11:22,054
And thirdly...

627
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:29,727
When l welcome you with open arms,..

628
01:11:29,799 --> 01:11:32,324
..you shall forget past animosity
and accept my friendship.

629
01:11:32,401 --> 01:11:33,493
Here!

630
01:12:09,038 --> 01:12:12,565
Let the drums roll...

631
01:12:12,642 --> 01:12:15,440
Victory is ours!

632
01:12:15,511 --> 01:12:18,480
'' We unbeatable warriors...''

633
01:12:18,547 --> 01:12:21,948
Have crushed the enemy!

634
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:36,759
The sparks of victory are ablaze.

635
01:13:37,026 --> 01:13:42,896
Our hearts are overflowing with pride.

636
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:49,529
Even the night sky
is full of rainbows!

637
01:14:17,733 --> 01:14:21,635
Our camp is bursting with energy!

638
01:14:23,973 --> 01:14:28,000
Our celebration knows no bounds.

639
01:14:29,745 --> 01:14:31,042
This victory...

640
01:14:31,313 --> 01:14:32,712
Our victory...

641
01:14:32,782 --> 01:14:36,343
This victory of ours is like no other!

642
01:15:25,768 --> 01:15:28,066
Mother!

643
01:15:28,938 --> 01:15:31,429
Bajirao's message!

644
01:15:31,507 --> 01:15:33,702
What does it say, Chimaji?

645
01:15:33,776 --> 01:15:36,506
His meeting with the Nizam...

646
01:15:37,012 --> 01:15:38,775
...was successful!

647
01:15:39,582 --> 01:15:43,484
Praise the Lord!

648
01:15:46,522 --> 01:15:49,889
Stop crying, Kashi!

649
01:15:50,693 --> 01:15:54,754
My son has not seen defeat
since she walked into this house.

650
01:15:54,997 --> 01:15:57,557
Your unborn child is destined for
great things too, Kashi.

651
01:15:57,666 --> 01:16:01,625
Mother, there should be a feast
for the Brahmins to celebrate!

652
01:16:01,704 --> 01:16:02,728
Agreed.

653
01:16:02,972 --> 01:16:05,873
Send out an invitation
to Krishna Bhatt...

654
01:16:05,941 --> 01:16:09,604
... That we shall host
the Brahmins this afternoon.

655
01:16:10,613 --> 01:16:11,511
Start the preparations!

656
01:16:14,016 --> 01:16:15,506
Chimaji...

657
01:16:16,252 --> 01:16:18,550
... Send a message to Mastani as well.

658
01:16:30,032 --> 01:16:34,366
Eid Mubarak in this new house,
My Lady! Where is my gift?

659
01:16:35,471 --> 01:16:36,699
What's there?

660
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:39,708
l thought the Peshwa called my name.

661
01:16:39,775 --> 01:16:42,005
How is that possible, My Lady!

662
01:16:42,278 --> 01:16:45,941
He will first go to Shaniwar Wada to
celebrate his victory over the Nizam.

663
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:50,018
Mastani Saheba!

664
01:17:10,472 --> 01:17:11,939
What is this Bajirao!

665
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:14,737
The power of your love Mastani!

666
01:17:15,744 --> 01:17:17,439
l wish you on your victory.

667
01:17:17,513 --> 01:17:19,481
And l wish you a happy Eid.

668
01:17:38,701 --> 01:17:42,660
Your face is glowing Mastani.

669
01:17:44,573 --> 01:17:46,006
Because you have returned.

670
01:17:47,843 --> 01:17:51,711
lt's like the glow in the sky,
just before sunrise...

671
01:17:52,748 --> 01:17:55,876
We'll have to think of a name for our
to-be born child!

672
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:10,892
My Lady!

673
01:18:11,233 --> 01:18:14,259
There's a message for you
from the Peshwa's mother...

674
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:16,966
What is it?

675
01:18:17,239 --> 01:18:20,606
There shall be a celebration tonight
in honour of the Peshwa's victory...

676
01:18:20,676 --> 01:18:24,737
On this occasion, Mastani is ordered
to present her dance...

677
01:18:39,628 --> 01:18:42,893
Your Ladyship, the food is served
and the Brahmins are waiting...

678
01:18:42,965 --> 01:18:44,398
... Why is the Peshwa not here?

679
01:18:44,533 --> 01:18:46,763
He is on his way,
please begin the feast.

680
01:18:46,835 --> 01:18:48,928
But how can we begin without the host?

681
01:18:49,004 --> 01:18:50,437
My Lady!

682
01:18:51,273 --> 01:18:52,638
Did you send the message?

683
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:54,539
Yes, but...

684
01:18:54,877 --> 01:18:55,935
But what?

685
01:18:56,011 --> 01:18:59,003
Mastani Saheba will no longer perform
as a court dancer.

686
01:18:59,815 --> 01:19:00,839
Says who?

687
01:19:00,916 --> 01:19:02,247
Mastani?

688
01:19:02,317 --> 01:19:04,842
No, My Lady... The Peshwa.

689
01:19:05,521 --> 01:19:08,615
He also said that he shall return
after the Eid feast...

690
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:10,988
... You need not wait for him.

691
01:19:11,427 --> 01:19:14,225
Dear God...

692
01:19:14,296 --> 01:19:15,627
Krishnaji...

693
01:19:15,931 --> 01:19:17,922
We cannot eat in this house anymore!!

694
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,697
Krishna Bhatt, you disrespect
the Peshwa by doing so!

695
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:24,933
And hasn't the Peshwa disrespected us?

696
01:19:25,674 --> 01:19:27,972
Charity is doled
out at mosques as well.

697
01:19:28,243 --> 01:19:30,768
Let's go!

698
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:46,020
Welcome home, Bajirao.

699
01:19:46,628 --> 01:19:48,459
Congratulations on
your win over the Nizam.

700
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:49,656
l wish you the same.

701
01:19:49,965 --> 01:19:51,364
Live long!

702
01:19:51,633 --> 01:19:53,658
Forgive me, l am late.

703
01:19:53,735 --> 01:19:57,762
While you were celebrating
Eid at Kothrud Palace...

704
01:19:57,973 --> 01:19:59,873
... The brahmins left
without eating a morsel.

705
01:19:59,942 --> 01:20:02,740
Never mind, we can invite them back
tomorrow and celebrate twice over.

706
01:20:03,045 --> 01:20:04,569
Why twice?

707
01:20:05,848 --> 01:20:07,907
Mastani is about to become
the mother of my child.

708
01:20:10,752 --> 01:20:15,951
lf the Brahmins walked out because
you chose to celebrate Eid with her...

709
01:20:16,592 --> 01:20:18,924
... What'll they do when
this news gets out, Bajirao?

710
01:20:18,994 --> 01:20:19,790
Mother...

711
01:20:19,862 --> 01:20:21,454
Don't interrupt me!

712
01:20:25,467 --> 01:20:31,030
l suggest, we don't tell Kashi.

713
01:20:33,475 --> 01:20:36,706
What is there to hide mother?

714
01:20:36,778 --> 01:20:40,908
The truth is, what it is!

715
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:53,857
Kashi...

716
01:20:55,397 --> 01:20:58,833
... l have been looking
for you all over and here you are.

717
01:20:59,568 --> 01:21:01,433
l was looking at the moon...

718
01:21:10,045 --> 01:21:11,672
l want to tell you
something important.

719
01:21:11,747 --> 01:21:14,807
That you have already eaten.

720
01:21:16,351 --> 01:21:17,477
Here's your paan.

721
01:21:17,553 --> 01:21:19,043
No, that's not it.

722
01:21:20,322 --> 01:21:21,380
Kashi, there's someone else...

723
01:21:21,456 --> 01:21:23,788
So the rumours are true.

724
01:21:23,859 --> 01:21:24,848
What rumours?

725
01:21:25,527 --> 01:21:27,995
That the Peshwa's caught the evil eye.

726
01:21:28,063 --> 01:21:32,022
Never mind the rumours...
l don't believe in superstitions.

727
01:21:32,301 --> 01:21:33,563
But l do...

728
01:21:33,969 --> 01:21:35,368
Here...

729
01:22:54,816 --> 01:22:56,374
Dear Mastani...

730
01:22:56,451 --> 01:23:01,946
Fighting in the battlefield is far easier than
fighting to keep your relationships intact.

731
01:23:02,557 --> 01:23:07,460
My heart wishes to be with you
every single moment.

732
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:13,263
But l cannot meet you till l, myself,
don't inform Kashi of our relationship.

733
01:23:13,702 --> 01:23:18,867
Kashi is not just my first wife...
She is my friend and confidant too.

734
01:23:19,441 --> 01:23:22,933
Until then,
please take care of yourself.

735
01:23:47,436 --> 01:23:48,960
Jhumri...

736
01:23:50,572 --> 01:23:52,665
My Lady!

737
01:23:54,876 --> 01:23:56,309
What news have you brought,
Veer Singh?

738
01:23:56,378 --> 01:23:58,312
l couldn't deliver your message to
the Peshwa even today...

739
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:01,740
News is that he is very ill and
unable to meet anyone.

740
01:24:03,518 --> 01:24:05,850
Get the palanquin ready.
l shall go to meet him right away.

741
01:24:05,921 --> 01:24:07,286
This news could be false, My Lady...

742
01:24:07,356 --> 01:24:08,414
lt could be true!

743
01:24:08,490 --> 01:24:11,926
Going to Shaniwar Wada at this hour
could be dangerous for you.

744
01:24:25,674 --> 01:24:26,834
Mahipat Rao...

745
01:24:27,042 --> 01:24:28,475
Veer Singh, what are you doing here?

746
01:24:28,543 --> 01:24:31,410
Mastani Saheba is
here to meet the Peshwa.

747
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,037
He is in his office.

748
01:24:32,314 --> 01:24:33,372
Who is there?

749
01:24:34,282 --> 01:24:35,977
Ambaji Panth's daughter-in-law.

750
01:24:46,595 --> 01:24:47,823
Shalubai!

751
01:24:49,431 --> 01:24:50,455
Shalubai!

752
01:24:50,532 --> 01:24:51,430
Yes.

753
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:54,060
See who that is.

754
01:24:54,336 --> 01:24:55,496
Yes.

755
01:25:03,612 --> 01:25:05,773
Shalubai... Who is it?

756
01:25:05,981 --> 01:25:08,313
lt is Ambaji Panth's daughter-in-law.

757
01:25:08,383 --> 01:25:11,682
So where is Gopikabai's palanquin...
They had left together.

758
01:25:11,753 --> 01:25:12,617
Shall l find out?

759
01:25:12,687 --> 01:25:14,985
No, l'll go myself.

760
01:25:20,462 --> 01:25:23,954
Mastani Saheba, please
wait at the Palace of Mirrors...

761
01:25:24,032 --> 01:25:25,397
l shall inform the Peshwa.

762
01:25:59,334 --> 01:26:02,235
Mastani, what brings
you here at this hour?

763
01:26:09,344 --> 01:26:09,901
Bajirao.

764
01:26:09,978 --> 01:26:13,709
You shouldn't have risked your life
by coming here.

765
01:26:13,782 --> 01:26:16,910
There's no bigger risk to my life
than spending a moment without you.

766
01:26:16,985 --> 01:26:19,351
You never got my letter...

767
01:26:24,793 --> 01:26:27,785
These fort walls have
become too high to scale.

768
01:26:27,863 --> 01:26:29,660
Yet here you are, Mastani.

769
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:34,460
lt's true that nothing can come in
the way of love.

770
01:28:14,703 --> 01:28:16,762
Lady Kashi's palanquin is here...

771
01:28:16,838 --> 01:28:20,672
Has the crib reached her quarters?

772
01:28:20,742 --> 01:28:23,734
Dear God! lt slipped my mind!
l'll check right away.

773
01:28:23,812 --> 01:28:27,612
The Peshwa must be
arriving any minute now!

774
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:30,445
My Lady...

775
01:28:30,785 --> 01:28:33,982
l stand to welcome
you like you always do...

776
01:28:35,023 --> 01:28:36,718
You have brought back
light to this lifeless..

777
01:28:36,791 --> 01:28:38,850
..palace by returning
from your maternal home.

778
01:28:40,729 --> 01:28:43,323
Let me see our youngest warrior!

779
01:28:53,041 --> 01:28:54,838
lt's a boy!

780
01:28:54,976 --> 01:28:59,310
Here, Here!

781
01:28:59,581 --> 01:29:00,843
Strong lad!

782
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:04,976
You will be a warrior
even greater than Bajirao.

783
01:29:05,587 --> 01:29:08,715
You have your mother's
beautiful eyes...

784
01:29:18,533 --> 01:29:18,965
Stop!

785
01:29:19,267 --> 01:29:19,790
Let me in!

786
01:29:19,868 --> 01:29:20,926
You cannot!

787
01:29:21,002 --> 01:29:23,402
l must meet My Lord!

788
01:29:23,471 --> 01:29:24,995
lt is not possible at this hour.

789
01:29:25,306 --> 01:29:27,001
My Lord!

790
01:29:31,346 --> 01:29:33,837
Make haste My Lord,
Mastani Saheba is in great pain.

791
01:29:33,915 --> 01:29:35,849
No midwife or doctor
is willing to attend to her.

792
01:29:35,984 --> 01:29:36,780
What if -

793
01:29:36,851 --> 01:29:38,409
She will be fine.

794
01:29:39,454 --> 01:29:46,622
A tigress needs no
doctors or midwives...

795
01:29:48,797 --> 01:29:50,822
lsn't it Chimaji?

796
01:30:09,517 --> 01:30:14,352
My Lady is truly suffering, Sir...
And no one is ready to help!

797
01:30:25,667 --> 01:30:30,730
Mastani, breathe...

798
01:30:32,073 --> 01:30:34,667
Giving birth to a
warrior is never easy.

799
01:31:02,036 --> 01:31:03,594
Look!

800
01:31:04,672 --> 01:31:05,696
Krishna

801
01:31:06,708 --> 01:31:07,868
Krishna

802
01:31:11,713 --> 01:31:13,044
Krishna

803
01:31:14,749 --> 01:31:16,580
Upon my return from the north,..

804
01:31:16,651 --> 01:31:18,846
..l'll organise a naming
ceremony for both my sons.

805
01:31:43,878 --> 01:31:46,847
Don't toy with our patience anymore...

806
01:31:46,915 --> 01:31:51,682
Aunt Bhiu,
tell us what name you have chosen.

807
01:31:51,753 --> 01:31:53,380
Tell us.

808
01:31:57,926 --> 01:32:00,394
Well, what will it be?

809
01:32:00,461 --> 01:32:01,450
Raghunath!

810
01:32:02,463 --> 01:32:03,452
Raghunath!

811
01:32:06,868 --> 01:32:10,326
When Bajirao is back, he will be happy
to hear the name.

812
01:32:13,975 --> 01:32:15,738
My Raghoba.

813
01:32:15,810 --> 01:32:18,005
What a lovely name, My Lady.

814
01:32:22,684 --> 01:32:24,015
Welcome, Mastani.

815
01:32:29,457 --> 01:32:30,481
Welcome!

816
01:32:30,558 --> 01:32:32,822
You have come at an opportune moment.

817
01:32:34,796 --> 01:32:38,357
Glad you could come.

818
01:32:39,434 --> 01:32:40,458
Mother...

819
01:32:41,002 --> 01:32:43,971
... How can someone lose all shame..

820
01:32:44,038 --> 01:32:46,472
..and keep returning to
your doorstep to be insulted?

821
01:32:46,708 --> 01:32:48,676
What offence can come
at your own doorstep?

822
01:32:50,445 --> 01:32:52,436
No insult can come by your own people.

823
01:32:53,615 --> 01:32:55,606
l am here to bless Bajirao's child.

824
01:32:55,683 --> 01:32:58,584
Are you here to bless relations
or to beg acceptance?

825
01:32:59,087 --> 01:33:01,988
l am here with gifts on
Bajirao's behalf in his absence.

826
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:04,952
lf you had to please
your way into our family...

827
01:33:05,026 --> 01:33:10,555
Then you should've got saffron clothes
and not this green coloured poison.

828
01:33:10,732 --> 01:33:14,759
People have associated each religion
with color, but colour has no religion...

829
01:33:15,303 --> 01:33:19,933
lt is when the heart turns black that
you start differentiating on such grounds.

830
01:33:20,308 --> 01:33:21,605
Leave it, Chimaji...

831
01:33:21,676 --> 01:33:22,836
She has forgotten the difference..

832
01:33:22,911 --> 01:33:25,038
..between durga(a Hindu goddess )
and dargah(Muslim shrine).

833
01:33:25,346 --> 01:33:32,411
Perhaps you forget that idols in
temples are often adorned in green...

834
01:33:32,887 --> 01:33:36,653
... And saffron sheets
cover the purest Sufi tombs.

835
01:33:36,724 --> 01:33:38,749
Where is the thought
of colour and religion then?

836
01:33:41,329 --> 01:33:45,732
Bajirao merely holds your hand and
your tongue begins to cut like a sword.

837
01:33:46,367 --> 01:33:51,737
A warrior's instinct is to reach for her
sword even when struck by a pebble.

838
01:33:52,407 --> 01:33:53,396
Krishna Bhatt...

839
01:33:53,708 --> 01:33:57,804
This year when we pray for the
deceased, add a prayer for her too...

840
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:00,673
... So that she is dead for us.

841
01:34:01,349 --> 01:34:02,407
Leave us now!

842
01:34:02,650 --> 01:34:05,710
Those prayers are not for strangers,
Mother...

843
01:34:06,621 --> 01:34:09,647
l'm grateful you thought
of me as your own.

844
01:34:50,932 --> 01:34:52,695
Welcome!

845
01:34:53,468 --> 01:34:57,802
l want you to organise
my son's naming ceremony.

846
01:34:58,439 --> 01:35:01,431
That's already been done, My Lord.
He has a blessed birth chart.

847
01:35:01,542 --> 01:35:04,306
No, not Raghunath... l am
talking about my other son, Krishna.

848
01:35:04,379 --> 01:35:05,471
He is my son too.

849
01:35:05,546 --> 01:35:07,309
My Lord,
traditions do not permit that.

850
01:35:07,682 --> 01:35:08,876
Why?

851
01:35:09,951 --> 01:35:13,011
As per our tradition, a son
inherits his father's religion...

852
01:35:13,321 --> 01:35:14,481
lsn't that right?

853
01:35:14,622 --> 01:35:17,284
How can you be wrong, My Lord.

854
01:35:17,458 --> 01:35:20,655
But it is imperative for
the child's parents to be...

855
01:35:20,728 --> 01:35:22,628
... married under the Hindu law.

856
01:35:22,964 --> 01:35:26,764
l shall marry Mastani
as per the Hindu law.

857
01:35:26,834 --> 01:35:28,529
Begin the preparations.

858
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:30,699
l'm afraid it still won't be possible.

859
01:35:30,772 --> 01:35:31,602
Why not?

860
01:35:31,672 --> 01:35:35,631
Krishna was born out of wedlock
and he shall always remain...

861
01:35:35,777 --> 01:35:36,869
... illegitimate!

862
01:35:36,944 --> 01:35:37,842
Am l right?

863
01:35:37,912 --> 01:35:39,038
Yes, yes...

864
01:35:39,347 --> 01:35:41,474
Your thinking is illegitimate,
Krishna Bhatt.

865
01:35:42,784 --> 01:35:47,483
Religion is bigger than anything,
My Lord... Even you!

866
01:35:47,555 --> 01:35:50,683
We cannot be a part of such blasphemy!

867
01:35:50,758 --> 01:35:52,749
Your thoughts do not matter to me.

868
01:35:52,827 --> 01:35:55,955
lf you cannot initiate
him into my faith...

869
01:35:56,364 --> 01:35:58,696
... Then he shall follow his mother's.

870
01:35:59,567 --> 01:36:02,695
And from today he will not be
called Krishna, but Shamsher Bahadur!

871
01:36:04,272 --> 01:36:06,263
Leave.

872
01:36:12,013 --> 01:36:13,981
We need to speed up tax collections.

873
01:36:14,282 --> 01:36:15,874
Send a message to the collectors.

874
01:36:16,651 --> 01:36:18,642
Why are these sweets
being distributed?

875
01:36:19,287 --> 01:36:21,346
What is the occasion?

876
01:36:21,622 --> 01:36:22,782
Who are these from?

877
01:36:23,591 --> 01:36:24,717
These are from me.

878
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:26,888
Please have.

879
01:36:26,961 --> 01:36:30,658
Chimaji, it's your favourite.

880
01:36:34,402 --> 01:36:35,767
What is the occasion, brother?

881
01:36:35,837 --> 01:36:39,568
l had a naming ceremony for Krishna
and changed his name.

882
01:36:39,774 --> 01:36:41,708
And what have you named him, My Lord?

883
01:36:42,443 --> 01:36:43,774
Shamsher Bahadur.

884
01:36:47,014 --> 01:36:49,710
The name of Peshwa's Muslim lineage.

885
01:36:55,590 --> 01:36:58,753
You all may leave.

886
01:37:01,262 --> 01:37:04,720
Panth, look at his face!

887
01:37:09,570 --> 01:37:10,594
Read it.

888
01:37:12,707 --> 01:37:17,406
The Peshwa decrees two estates to
be gifted to Mastani Bajirao Ballad.

889
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:21,241
lmpossible, Bajirao!

890
01:37:21,315 --> 01:37:22,748
We do not entertain such practices.

891
01:37:22,817 --> 01:37:24,682
From this day on, we shall.

892
01:37:26,354 --> 01:37:26,945
What say, Panth?

893
01:37:27,255 --> 01:37:29,621
l fail to understand, why does
she need estates when you are here?

894
01:37:29,690 --> 01:37:31,555
Don't you see, Panth?

895
01:37:32,393 --> 01:37:35,021
lf they can throw her out of my house
while l'm alive...

896
01:37:35,296 --> 01:37:37,696
... lmagine how they'd
treat her when l'm gone.

897
01:37:38,633 --> 01:37:42,262
You have to safeguard
the future of your loved ones.

898
01:37:42,336 --> 01:37:44,702
Today it's an estate, tomorrow you'll
gift her the entire Peshwa kingdom.

899
01:37:45,006 --> 01:37:46,940
You cannot gift away
territory at whim.

900
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:50,000
But you can put up a woman
in a brothel at whim?

901
01:37:50,278 --> 01:37:50,972
That is my understanding.

902
01:37:51,279 --> 01:37:53,406
Make me understand as well.

903
01:37:53,648 --> 01:37:54,842
A dagger deserves a sheath...

904
01:37:55,349 --> 01:37:56,680
A wife deserves a home...

905
01:37:56,951 --> 01:37:58,851
And a mistress deserves a hovel!

906
01:38:10,898 --> 01:38:13,696
You missed your aim, My Lord.

907
01:38:15,970 --> 01:38:18,905
No... Our relationship
came in the way.

908
01:38:18,973 --> 01:38:20,531
That's why l say...

909
01:38:20,841 --> 01:38:23,776
You must end all relations that
become a hindrance.

910
01:38:25,613 --> 01:38:27,911
Sometimes your relations
themselves finish you.

911
01:38:30,251 --> 01:38:33,914
Seal the orders!

912
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:42,718
Bajirao fought with his brother today
in front of the entire court...

913
01:38:42,997 --> 01:38:48,435
... stripping his relationship
of dignity, all for that mistress.

914
01:38:50,404 --> 01:38:51,769
lt's wrong!

915
01:38:52,673 --> 01:38:56,666
l do not understand right or
wrong anymore mother.

916
01:38:56,811 --> 01:39:01,248
l lived my entire
life as his shadow...

917
01:39:01,549 --> 01:39:04,575
And one day he just
walked into darkness...

918
01:39:05,586 --> 01:39:08,282
Not once thinking that
this shadow will fade away.

919
01:39:08,489 --> 01:39:11,583
No one can understand
your pain like me...

920
01:39:12,526 --> 01:39:15,859
The status of the lady of this house
may be as grand as a mango orchard...

921
01:39:17,531 --> 01:39:20,295
Whose fruit is longed for by all...

922
01:39:21,302 --> 01:39:24,430
But to acquire the fruit,
one must stone the trees...

923
01:39:25,539 --> 01:39:27,507
And that is the orchard's destiny.

924
01:39:30,745 --> 01:39:31,769
Kashi...

925
01:39:32,313 --> 01:39:36,841
We should've sewn the flag green,
to the mistress's liking!

926
01:39:55,670 --> 01:39:57,729
Oh Lord!

927
01:40:15,990 --> 01:40:24,796
(Chants )

928
01:40:28,336 --> 01:40:30,736
Come, Krishna Bhatt. Hello, Mother.

929
01:40:30,805 --> 01:40:32,329
How did you know, My Lord?

930
01:40:32,406 --> 01:40:34,704
A warrior must always be alert.

931
01:40:34,775 --> 01:40:36,800
Enemy can strike at any moment.

932
01:40:38,846 --> 01:40:41,440
Raghav, greet your grandmother.

933
01:40:42,350 --> 01:40:44,682
Shamsher, you too.

934
01:40:44,852 --> 01:40:49,983
Krishna Bhatt wanted to know, when you
will perform the repentance prayers.

935
01:40:50,324 --> 01:40:51,450
Repentance?

936
01:40:51,592 --> 01:40:53,321
You used to perform it every year...

937
01:40:53,394 --> 01:40:56,761
For the gratification
of martyrs' souls.

938
01:40:56,831 --> 01:40:58,662
You haven't performed it in two years.

939
01:40:58,733 --> 01:41:01,395
Yes, and it won't happen again.

940
01:41:01,836 --> 01:41:03,667
You are refusing it being a brahmin?

941
01:41:03,838 --> 01:41:06,773
l am brahmin only by birth,
but a warrior by destiny.

942
01:41:06,941 --> 01:41:10,433
This ritual is mandatory
for the purification of our soul.

943
01:41:12,012 --> 01:41:15,675
Alright, let's purify our souls...

944
01:41:16,784 --> 01:41:21,448
l shall bring Mastani to Shaniwar Wada
and give her the rights of being my wife...

945
01:41:21,956 --> 01:41:23,981
That can be my only atonement.

946
01:41:25,693 --> 01:41:28,355
l am proud to have a son like you...

947
01:41:29,530 --> 01:41:31,691
Who knows how to respect a woman...

948
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:34,695
But what you ask for is impossible.

949
01:41:35,636 --> 01:41:36,933
Never, my son!

950
01:41:38,939 --> 01:41:40,804
On Saptami (auspicious day)...

951
01:41:41,942 --> 01:41:44,035
l shall bring Mastani
to Shaniwar Wada.

952
01:41:44,345 --> 01:41:49,874
The Brahmins shall ostracize the entire
Peshwa clan if that were to happen.

953
01:42:24,318 --> 01:42:25,649
Welcome home...

954
01:42:28,355 --> 01:42:31,290
lt shall be known
to all as Mastani Mahal.

955
01:42:35,896 --> 01:42:37,329
Panth...

956
01:42:39,333 --> 01:42:40,493
Brother...

957
01:42:41,702 --> 01:42:42,862
Chimaji....

958
01:42:52,446 --> 01:42:54,914
Everyone seems to be welcoming you
with their absence!

959
01:43:08,496 --> 01:43:10,987
Chimaji and Ambaji have
gone out to inspect lands.

960
01:43:11,732 --> 01:43:13,597
Mother has gone on a pilgrimage.

961
01:43:13,801 --> 01:43:16,326
So as the lady of this house...

962
01:43:17,404 --> 01:43:22,000
l welcome you and your guest.

963
01:43:25,613 --> 01:43:26,773
Come.

964
01:43:42,496 --> 01:43:45,590
Don't touch my feet! (A Hindu
tradition of giving blessings )

965
01:43:53,674 --> 01:43:55,767
Thank you for keeping my honour,
My Lady.

966
01:43:57,344 --> 01:43:58,936
lt lightens my mind.

967
01:44:00,314 --> 01:44:02,680
Don't forget My Lord...

968
01:44:04,285 --> 01:44:09,245
This welcome stops at the threshold,
it doesn't extend to the heart.

969
01:44:41,555 --> 01:44:43,819
Nana! When did you arrive?

970
01:44:45,826 --> 01:44:50,024
You didn't write or send
a message from the capital.

971
01:44:50,664 --> 01:44:53,599
Had l known you were coming,
l would've welcomed you in style.

972
01:44:53,667 --> 01:44:53,996
Namaste.

973
01:44:54,301 --> 01:44:55,700
Stay blessed!

974
01:44:57,972 --> 01:44:59,564
You've grown so tall.

975
01:44:59,907 --> 01:45:02,467
Your moustache has
started showing too.

976
01:45:02,776 --> 01:45:06,644
l hope you are learning
politics from the king.

977
01:45:06,747 --> 01:45:07,611
Yes.

978
01:45:07,781 --> 01:45:10,875
l wish you learnt some
politics as well, Mother.

979
01:45:10,951 --> 01:45:12,282
Meaning?

980
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:17,848
The man for whom you hold this flame,
doesn't deserve it.

981
01:45:17,925 --> 01:45:19,256
What have you done?

982
01:45:21,495 --> 01:45:22,928
What did you do, Nana?

983
01:45:24,531 --> 01:45:26,499
Do you know who you are talking about?

984
01:45:26,634 --> 01:45:27,896
Yes, Mother.

985
01:45:28,636 --> 01:45:31,537
The man who is the talk of every town
from Pune to the capital...

986
01:45:31,972 --> 01:45:34,964
For burning his own home
with Bundelkhand's torch.

987
01:45:35,576 --> 01:45:38,340
Yet you sit here praying for him!

988
01:45:38,646 --> 01:45:39,908
Nana!

989
01:45:50,357 --> 01:45:53,019
Don't worry about me so much, my son.

990
01:46:15,482 --> 01:46:16,540
My Lady!

991
01:46:17,251 --> 01:46:19,845
Shiva Bhatt, you startled me!

992
01:46:20,287 --> 01:46:21,254
The prayers are about to start

993
01:46:21,321 --> 01:46:23,380
My Lady, a grave disaster
is about to happen tonight.

994
01:46:23,924 --> 01:46:24,822
What disaster?

995
01:46:25,426 --> 01:46:27,758
While we pray,
Mastani Mahal will be attacked.

996
01:46:27,995 --> 01:46:32,295
She will be murdered.
Please save her if you can!

997
01:46:41,642 --> 01:46:54,783
Hail Lord Ganesha
(Hindu God of obstacles ).

998
01:50:56,063 --> 01:50:58,827
How shall you atone for this crime,
Krishna Bhatt?

999
01:50:58,899 --> 01:51:03,563
What proof exists that Krishna Bhatt
has murdered Shiva Bhatt?

1000
01:51:03,870 --> 01:51:04,928
Mother...

1001
01:51:06,406 --> 01:51:07,668
How shall you atone for this crime?

1002
01:51:07,741 --> 01:51:10,301
What atonement, what punishment?

1003
01:51:10,377 --> 01:51:13,574
Whoever opposes religion
will meet such an end.

1004
01:51:13,814 --> 01:51:18,717
lt was your mistress's good fortune, else
she would've been cut to pieces as well.

1005
01:52:04,765 --> 01:52:07,359
My Lord, your mother is here.

1006
01:52:07,834 --> 01:52:12,430
Why have we been summoned like
criminals, despite sharing the same roof?

1007
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:17,303
When walls come up between hearts,
they no longer hold a house together.

1008
01:52:17,644 --> 01:52:19,544
Yes, we get it!

1009
01:52:19,746 --> 01:52:21,611
Why have you summoned us?
What's our crime?

1010
01:52:21,681 --> 01:52:23,774
Krishna Bhatt!

1011
01:52:26,953 --> 01:52:30,354
Protecting a criminal is your crime.

1012
01:52:30,424 --> 01:52:32,551
How dare you talk
to mother in this manner!

1013
01:52:32,626 --> 01:52:33,820
And you?

1014
01:52:35,762 --> 01:52:37,593
How dare you talk to
the Peshwa in this manner.

1015
01:52:37,664 --> 01:52:38,460
My Lord!

1016
01:52:38,532 --> 01:52:41,729
Remind him,
l won't miss my aim every time.

1017
01:52:41,802 --> 01:52:42,962
Bajirao, this isn't you...

1018
01:52:43,870 --> 01:52:46,600
... But the influence of Bundelkhand's
gift. She has gotten to your head.

1019
01:52:48,041 --> 01:52:50,635
Bundelkhand's gifts
are on your head too...

1020
01:52:51,311 --> 01:52:56,749
These jewels on your head, around your
neck; are all Bundelkhand's gifts...

1021
01:52:56,817 --> 01:52:58,751
You can't accept these gifts?

1022
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:02,379
Then take them off!

1023
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:16,367
Bundelkhand's gifts are accepted,
not their daughter.

1024
01:53:16,937 --> 01:53:19,770
Mastani as my mistress is accepted,
not as my wife...

1025
01:53:20,941 --> 01:53:25,571
But remember mother, Bajirao's
love for Mastani is unconditional.

1026
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:30,406
Where do you find such
hatred for her, mother?

1027
01:53:30,550 --> 01:53:35,681
Peshwa blood cannot be adulterated by
an outsider, it's that simple!

1028
01:53:35,889 --> 01:53:37,584
That's been done... Now?

1029
01:53:37,657 --> 01:53:38,817
That's what!

1030
01:53:39,359 --> 01:53:43,352
You fight Muslims and yet
fell in love with one of them?

1031
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:46,922
l fight the Mughal dynasty,
not their religion.

1032
01:53:47,601 --> 01:53:49,762
l ask you one last time...

1033
01:53:50,504 --> 01:53:57,034
Bajirao shall remain Peshwa
only if Mastani is accepted...

1034
01:53:57,978 --> 01:53:59,445
Agreed?

1035
01:54:00,947 --> 01:54:02,312
No.

1036
01:54:25,539 --> 01:54:26,699
lt's yours!

1037
01:54:28,675 --> 01:54:29,767
Bajirao

1038
01:54:54,734 --> 01:54:55,826
Kashi!

1039
01:54:56,436 --> 01:55:01,931
l've been looking for you all over.
l've wished everyone except you.

1040
01:55:03,276 --> 01:55:04,868
Where are you going?

1041
01:55:05,345 --> 01:55:06,539
l'll be back soon.

1042
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,609
But where are you going?

1043
01:55:09,449 --> 01:55:10,643
Mastani Mahal

1044
01:55:29,436 --> 01:55:31,404
l'm happy to see you, sister.

1045
01:55:31,471 --> 01:55:34,531
My Lady'... Not sister.

1046
01:55:35,642 --> 01:55:37,735
l'm the Peshwa's legally wedded wife.

1047
01:55:38,678 --> 01:55:41,306
Kashi Bajirao Ballad

1048
01:55:41,548 --> 01:55:42,606
We've been related for years -

1049
01:55:42,682 --> 01:55:43,944
What relation?

1050
01:55:46,519 --> 01:55:47,486
Say?

1051
01:55:47,721 --> 01:55:50,417
The man you are married to,
is my husband as well.

1052
01:55:52,826 --> 01:55:53,850
Maybe so.

1053
01:55:54,294 --> 01:55:57,525
But as far as l know,
when a married man..

1054
01:55:57,597 --> 01:56:01,431
..takes another wife,
she's known as a concubine...

1055
01:56:04,271 --> 01:56:06,296
lt is such a heavy word...

1056
01:56:06,606 --> 01:56:08,767
There is a simpler term for it...

1057
01:56:09,376 --> 01:56:10,570
Mistress

1058
01:56:19,953 --> 01:56:21,477
Such mockery is unbecoming of you.

1059
01:56:21,554 --> 01:56:22,612
Really!

1060
01:56:23,556 --> 01:56:25,547
But who understands
mockery better than you!

1061
01:56:26,259 --> 01:56:28,352
Leaving your people
behind in Bundelkhand..

1062
01:56:28,428 --> 01:56:30,828
..to run after a man
all the way to Pune...

1063
01:56:31,731 --> 01:56:33,756
That, Mastani Saheba, is mockery.

1064
01:56:33,933 --> 01:56:35,798
Do matters of the
heart have no meaning?

1065
01:56:35,869 --> 01:56:38,599
What heart do you talk of?

1066
01:56:38,905 --> 01:56:41,465
A heart that flitters
from one to another?

1067
01:56:43,443 --> 01:56:45,911
There is no place
for such purposeless matters...

1068
01:56:46,613 --> 01:56:48,444
Then your visit must have purpose too.

1069
01:56:48,515 --> 01:56:49,413
Of course.

1070
01:56:49,983 --> 01:56:51,450
We have a festival today.

1071
01:56:51,951 --> 01:56:55,717
Married women come together to celebrate
this day for their husbands' long lives...

1072
01:56:55,789 --> 01:56:58,383
... They adorn their
foreheads with vermilion.

1073
01:57:02,595 --> 01:57:04,756
l can't demean you any further...

1074
01:57:05,465 --> 01:57:09,458
But you will have to face
a lot of humiliation here...

1075
01:57:09,703 --> 01:57:13,230
Don't take it to heart.

1076
01:57:14,808 --> 01:57:21,611
Rao's happiness lies with you
and mine with his...

1077
01:57:22,615 --> 01:57:24,810
That's my purpose.

1078
01:57:24,984 --> 01:57:26,474
Here, put.

1079
01:57:32,459 --> 01:57:34,393
This is the hand he holds...

1080
01:57:34,828 --> 01:57:38,662
He prefers holding
his sword to my hand...

1081
01:57:38,965 --> 01:57:42,366
But he holds your hand
dearer than any sword.

1082
01:57:42,502 --> 01:57:45,437
He has held my hand without
letting go of yours...

1083
01:57:45,638 --> 01:57:48,471
He has loved me,
but not broken ties with you.

1084
01:57:49,376 --> 01:57:54,473
He may call me his inspiration,
but you remain his strength...

1085
01:57:55,515 --> 01:57:57,710
His love for you has not withered.

1086
01:58:06,559 --> 01:58:09,494
l may be illegitimate,
but your coming here..

1087
01:58:10,597 --> 01:58:12,428
..has validated my
presence amongst you all.

1088
01:58:19,539 --> 01:58:20,767
Here...

1089
01:58:21,541 --> 01:58:24,908
This sari will look good on you.

1090
01:58:30,250 --> 01:58:31,478
l'll take your leave.

1091
01:58:49,702 --> 01:58:54,605
Let us celebrate the
sanctity of marriage.

1092
01:58:54,674 --> 01:59:00,010
Let us pray for our
husbands' long lives.

1093
01:59:19,933 --> 01:59:26,668
Here she comes, looking like Radha.

1094
01:59:32,745 --> 01:59:41,778
My love's innocent beloved... She
appears at my door, like a full moon.

1095
01:59:41,955 --> 01:59:52,695
Today on this occasion,
together we shall dance...

1096
02:01:31,464 --> 02:01:36,993
Your love has caused me pain,
like a dagger through my heart.

1097
02:01:39,305 --> 02:01:44,038
You may accuse me of anything,
but l'm just a soul lost in love.

1098
02:01:44,344 --> 02:01:46,642
Maybe that's our destiny...

1099
02:01:46,713 --> 02:01:50,809
To love a man who can never belong
completely to either one of us.

1100
02:02:46,806 --> 02:02:50,867
My Lord, Nizam's son, Nasirjung has
revolted against us.

1101
02:02:51,044 --> 02:02:52,602
So?

1102
02:02:54,047 --> 02:02:57,505
He has crossed the river Godavri
and is approaching Shahgarh.

1103
02:02:59,485 --> 02:03:00,474
So?

1104
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:02,854
lt appears My Lord is intoxicated.

1105
02:03:02,922 --> 02:03:03,786
So?

1106
02:03:05,391 --> 02:03:07,916
Who is not?

1107
02:03:08,394 --> 02:03:10,624
Everyone is intoxicated.

1108
02:03:11,364 --> 02:03:17,303
By wealth, religion, power... Pratinidhi,
Krishna Bhatt are all intoxicated.

1109
02:03:17,637 --> 02:03:19,628
So am l...

1110
02:03:21,574 --> 02:03:23,565
l am intoxicated by love!

1111
02:03:24,711 --> 02:03:27,305
You are unsteady, My Lord!

1112
02:03:44,430 --> 02:03:48,491
My feet may be unsteady
but my grip is firm.

1113
02:03:48,735 --> 02:03:50,498
What say, Malhar Rao?

1114
02:03:50,737 --> 02:03:51,931
Look!

1115
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:58,474
That is why we need you to
win this battle for us, Peshwa.

1116
02:03:58,544 --> 02:03:59,841
l am no longer the Peshwa!

1117
02:04:00,046 --> 02:04:01,411
But you are our Commander.

1118
02:04:01,481 --> 02:04:03,346
l am not a Commander either.

1119
02:04:09,622 --> 02:04:12,921
When you first learnt to ride,
we ran alongside your horse.

1120
02:04:13,426 --> 02:04:15,792
We put in as much sweat as your steed.

1121
02:04:15,962 --> 02:04:21,298
Malhar Rao fought battles beside you,
suffered injuries to uphold your honour.

1122
02:04:21,501 --> 02:04:25,801
Tukoji nursed you despite
being wounded himself.

1123
02:04:25,872 --> 02:04:28,500
Commanders aren't made overnight,
My Lord!

1124
02:04:28,574 --> 02:04:36,379
And when the enemy stands at our
gates, you are abdicating your duties.

1125
02:04:40,653 --> 02:04:45,420
Bajirao's heart may belong to Mastani,
but his life belongs to his homeland...

1126
02:04:47,493 --> 02:04:49,723
A thousand Bajiraos and
Mastanis will be happily..

1127
02:04:49,796 --> 02:04:52,594
..sacrificed for one
more Maratha victory.

1128
02:04:53,666 --> 02:04:55,600
Let it be known...

1129
02:04:56,569 --> 02:04:59,595
Bajirao will leave for
battle on New Year's eve.

1130
02:05:01,707 --> 02:05:02,901
Praise the Lord!

1131
02:05:03,609 --> 02:05:04,871
Praise the Lord!

1132
02:05:05,545 --> 02:05:07,240
Praise the Lord!

1133
02:05:12,785 --> 02:05:16,619
lt's a day to light lamps,
not extinguish them.

1134
02:05:17,557 --> 02:05:18,922
You didn't send word of your arrival.

1135
02:05:18,991 --> 02:05:20,925
The Peshwa doesn't
inform of his plans.

1136
02:05:20,993 --> 02:05:23,655
You haven't been here for a while.

1137
02:05:24,363 --> 02:05:26,888
Those who wander can be found...

1138
02:05:27,366 --> 02:05:32,269
But ones who lose themselves within
their own house are hard to trace.

1139
02:05:32,905 --> 02:05:33,633
Ok!

1140
02:05:34,540 --> 02:05:38,533
As the first lady of this house,
won't you see me off to war?

1141
02:05:40,012 --> 02:05:42,503
lf clothes and jewels alone
make me Lady of this house ...

1142
02:05:43,416 --> 02:05:44,542
(Calls out to Chambermaid)

1143
02:05:45,651 --> 02:05:47,516
Bring the pooja thaali
(A prayer plate).

1144
02:05:48,454 --> 02:05:51,787
Here, sit.

1145
02:05:52,592 --> 02:05:54,560
l have left you alone, Kashi.

1146
02:05:54,627 --> 02:05:55,992
l am never alone, My Lord.

1147
02:05:56,295 --> 02:05:58,855
The entire day passes
in household chores...

1148
02:05:58,931 --> 02:06:02,492
... And evenings are spent
with my Raghoba, listening to sermons.

1149
02:06:03,402 --> 02:06:09,272
The Priest told us a nice story yesterday...
Sit with me, l shall tell you.

1150
02:06:20,319 --> 02:06:23,447
The priest was saying...

1151
02:06:24,624 --> 02:06:26,717
Lord Krishna and his wife
Rukmani were having a dialogue...

1152
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:31,391
Rukmani said, l have loved you too...

1153
02:06:31,664 --> 02:06:38,331
Yet l wish l was your
beloved and not your wife.

1154
02:06:38,638 --> 02:06:39,366
Why?

1155
02:06:39,438 --> 02:06:42,464
Lord Krishna also asked, 'Why'?

1156
02:06:44,277 --> 02:06:49,510
Rukmani said however deep a
matrimonial bond may be...

1157
02:06:49,582 --> 02:06:52,346
... The world always
remembers the beloved.

1158
02:06:52,652 --> 02:06:57,521
Radhe Krishna, Radhe Krishna!
(Famous devotional chant)

1159
02:06:57,790 --> 02:07:01,351
Kashi, you are as
dear to me as Mastani.

1160
02:07:02,228 --> 02:07:05,595
Lord Krishna also said the same.

1161
02:07:06,499 --> 02:07:09,297
l have never compared you two.

1162
02:07:10,903 --> 02:07:13,463
There can be no comparison between us!

1163
02:07:13,906 --> 02:07:17,637
l didn't perform the Rasa Leela
(divine dance of passion) with you.

1164
02:07:19,245 --> 02:07:21,611
Your complaints against
Mastani and l are justified.

1165
02:07:21,681 --> 02:07:23,774
What complaints can
one have against strangers.

1166
02:07:24,984 --> 02:07:27,544
The wounds inflicted
by one's own hurt most.

1167
02:07:29,822 --> 02:07:32,757
Had you asked for my life, My Lord...

1168
02:07:32,825 --> 02:07:37,387
... l would have
sacrificed it with a smile.

1169
02:07:37,797 --> 02:07:41,631
But you've stripped me of my pride.

1170
02:07:54,680 --> 02:07:59,845
l shall happily accept your punishments
for the hurt l've caused you.

1171
02:07:59,919 --> 02:08:03,821
Punishments?
No, l shall give you good news.

1172
02:08:03,889 --> 02:08:04,719
What do you mean?

1173
02:08:08,294 --> 02:08:10,592
You shall never enter
these chambers again.

1174
02:08:13,499 --> 02:08:14,796
Do you know what you ask for?

1175
02:08:14,867 --> 02:08:19,861
l took a vow to keep you happy
when l set foot in this house...

1176
02:08:20,539 --> 02:08:21,665
l'm only trying to uphold it.

1177
02:08:41,594 --> 02:08:42,925
Here!

1178
02:09:34,280 --> 02:09:35,372
Praise the Lord!

1179
02:09:35,781 --> 02:09:37,271
Praise the Lord!

1180
02:09:39,452 --> 02:09:41,818
lt's time to bid farewell, Mastani.

1181
02:09:44,623 --> 02:09:46,682
l shall await your return.

1182
02:09:49,728 --> 02:09:53,892
We shall meet when the setting sun
and rising moon appear together in the sky.

1183
02:09:55,768 --> 02:09:58,362
The sky will change colour, and
all will be bathed in an orange glow.

1184
02:09:58,537 --> 02:10:01,700
Winds of desire will blow, And
thundering clouds will fill the skies.

1185
02:10:02,708 --> 02:10:05,905
Dry leaves will murmur and
untimely rains will wash the earth.

1186
02:10:08,614 --> 02:10:11,708
There will be no shackles of religion
or relationships to tear us apart.

1187
02:10:12,017 --> 02:10:16,351
All that will remain will
be the fire of love in our hearts...

1188
02:10:16,922 --> 02:10:21,655
On that day...
We will become one for eternity.

1189
02:11:15,514 --> 02:11:17,277
You called for me, grandmother?

1190
02:11:17,416 --> 02:11:20,749
lt's time to erase the dishonour
brought to our family, Nana.

1191
02:11:21,887 --> 02:11:23,752
Arrest Mastani.

1192
02:11:24,757 --> 02:11:26,952
What shall we tell the Peshwa?

1193
02:11:27,826 --> 02:11:29,350
Don't be scared.

1194
02:11:29,962 --> 02:11:32,453
When it comes to
protecting the kingdom...

1195
02:11:32,998 --> 02:11:35,967
... Even the closest
relations must be sacrificed.

1196
02:12:06,999 --> 02:12:12,562
You are in my heart, like a prayer.

1197
02:12:33,425 --> 02:12:48,671
The mention of your
name shall be my worship...

1198
02:13:08,460 --> 02:13:10,792
We have surrounded Nasirjung
from all sides, Bajirao.

1199
02:13:11,463 --> 02:13:12,794
Malhar Rao is in the
north with his troops...

1200
02:13:12,865 --> 02:13:14,992
Vaman Rao and Ambaji
Panth are in the south.

1201
02:13:15,634 --> 02:13:18,603
How shall we strategise the attack?

1202
02:13:18,671 --> 02:13:19,968
Head-on.

1203
02:13:21,273 --> 02:13:23,707
Like life does...

1204
02:13:26,011 --> 02:13:28,605
You don't know when it hits you!

1205
02:13:28,681 --> 02:13:29,545
My Lord!

1206
02:13:29,615 --> 02:13:31,412
What are you doing here, Veer Singh?

1207
02:13:31,483 --> 02:13:34,384
Nana Saheb has arrested
Mastani Saheba!

1208
02:13:51,303 --> 02:13:53,669
Bajirao!

1209
02:14:09,822 --> 02:14:11,653
Go with Bajirao.

1210
02:14:12,591 --> 02:14:13,853
Prepare for attack!

1211
02:14:13,926 --> 02:14:18,420
(War Cry)

1212
02:16:08,574 --> 02:16:11,873
lt's your last chance
to return to Bundelkhand.

1213
02:16:11,944 --> 02:16:14,504
l wouldn't have allowed these shackles
if l planned to return.

1214
02:16:14,580 --> 02:16:19,415
My hatred for you goes beyond
its very essence, Mastani.

1215
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:24,980
Your hatred only
immortalises my love, Nana.

1216
02:16:25,824 --> 02:16:26,722
Carry her child away!

1217
02:16:26,792 --> 02:16:28,350
No need for that.

1218
02:16:29,495 --> 02:16:31,963
Bajirao's son shall
walk out on his own feet.

1219
02:16:34,733 --> 02:16:35,995
Shamsher Bahadur.

1220
02:16:41,373 --> 02:16:42,305
Who is a warrior?

1221
02:16:42,875 --> 02:16:44,900
He, who fears none.

1222
02:16:45,711 --> 02:16:47,303
What is self belief?

1223
02:16:47,913 --> 02:16:49,505
Sign of victory.

1224
02:16:49,815 --> 02:16:50,907
Fear?

1225
02:16:50,983 --> 02:16:52,678
Another name for defeat.

1226
02:16:53,418 --> 02:16:54,646
Who shall be your ideal?

1227
02:16:54,887 --> 02:16:57,651
Peshwa Bajirao Ballad.

1228
02:17:02,594 --> 02:17:03,720
Goodbye.

1229
02:17:04,363 --> 02:17:06,297
Goodbye, Mother.

1230
02:17:37,296 --> 02:17:43,633
There's only one warrior in all of lndia
to have won forty consecutive battles.

1231
02:17:43,969 --> 02:17:46,597
Peshwa Bajirao!

1232
02:17:47,005 --> 02:17:50,441
Nasirjung has surrendered...

1233
02:17:50,776 --> 02:17:52,676
Here's to one more Maratha victory!

1234
02:17:53,645 --> 02:17:55,374
And my loss.

1235
02:17:56,481 --> 02:17:57,539
l don't understand...

1236
02:17:57,616 --> 02:18:00,949
Declare war...
l shall attack Pune next.

1237
02:18:02,888 --> 02:18:05,322
l shall release Mastani.

1238
02:18:05,591 --> 02:18:09,527
You will fight against
your own family?

1239
02:18:09,595 --> 02:18:11,859
You will turn against us for Mastani?

1240
02:18:11,930 --> 02:18:16,424
And who will you kill?
Mother, Kashi or your son...

1241
02:18:58,410 --> 02:18:58,933
Bajirao...

1242
02:18:59,578 --> 02:19:01,409
l take your leave.

1243
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:05,776
We must certify this victory before
Nasirjung can change his mind...

1244
02:19:08,587 --> 02:19:09,576
l'll be back soon.

1245
02:19:13,458 --> 02:19:14,755
Please come inside, My Lord.

1246
02:19:15,260 --> 02:19:16,818
This breeze could
aggravate your fever.

1247
02:19:16,895 --> 02:19:24,495
l am waiting for someone...

1248
02:19:26,838 --> 02:19:32,299
Mastani, you have run out of options,
so name your last wish...

1249
02:19:32,477 --> 02:19:34,809
How would you like to die?

1250
02:19:36,515 --> 02:19:38,346
With Peshwa Bajirao!

1251
02:19:45,724 --> 02:19:48,420
This ailment is beyond
my understanding, Sir.

1252
02:19:48,860 --> 02:19:52,421
The fever shows no sign of subsiding.

1253
02:19:52,698 --> 02:19:55,997
lt is time to call Kashi and Mother.

1254
02:19:56,501 --> 02:19:59,368
Being with family
might improve his health.

1255
02:20:52,023 --> 02:20:56,722
The king's orders are against us,
Grandmother.

1256
02:20:56,895 --> 02:20:58,453
Are you listening?

1257
02:20:59,464 --> 02:21:02,399
He says he cannot lose
a warrior like Bajirao...

1258
02:21:03,602 --> 02:21:06,867
And hence we must release Mastani.

1259
02:21:07,639 --> 02:21:09,334
l shall travel to
the capital tomorrow.

1260
02:21:10,275 --> 02:21:11,537
l shall speak to the king.

1261
02:21:11,610 --> 02:21:13,009
l shall travel to
Ravelkhedi tomorrow...

1262
02:21:15,013 --> 02:21:16,640
Bajirao is unwell.

1263
02:21:17,282 --> 02:21:19,375
And nothing can happen
till l return with him.

1264
02:21:25,557 --> 02:21:26,922
Are you scared, Grandmother?

1265
02:21:27,592 --> 02:21:29,617
You all may bow down before Mastani...

1266
02:21:30,629 --> 02:21:32,688
But l shall not!

1267
02:21:34,332 --> 02:21:35,822
l shall not!

1268
02:21:46,645 --> 02:21:48,875
Look who is here, My Lord.

1269
02:22:12,637 --> 02:22:13,604
Mastani

1270
02:22:27,519 --> 02:22:28,884
ls Shamsher well?

1271
02:22:30,388 --> 02:22:31,286
Yes, he is.

1272
02:22:36,695 --> 02:22:38,287
He's learning to ride.

1273
02:22:41,666 --> 02:22:42,655
Kashi?

1274
02:22:45,971 --> 02:22:47,336
She's well too...

1275
02:22:49,908 --> 02:22:54,436
Busy pretending that her heart
has turned to stone.

1276
02:23:07,425 --> 02:23:09,757
l need your stamp on this.

1277
02:23:10,295 --> 02:23:11,319
Later.

1278
02:23:11,463 --> 02:23:12,395
This can't wait.

1279
02:23:12,697 --> 02:23:13,994
What is so urgent?

1280
02:23:14,299 --> 02:23:15,664
Mastani's release orders.

1281
02:23:17,502 --> 02:23:19,436
Have you lost your mind, Kashi?

1282
02:23:19,504 --> 02:23:21,904
Only she can save Bajirao.

1283
02:23:23,508 --> 02:23:24,600
l cannot approve this.

1284
02:23:24,676 --> 02:23:26,644
l cannot see Bajirao losing himself.

1285
02:23:28,380 --> 02:23:32,874
The man who never lost a
battle is losing to his own family.

1286
02:23:32,951 --> 02:23:34,714
l cannot approve that!

1287
02:23:36,621 --> 02:23:37,610
Stamp this!

1288
02:23:38,490 --> 02:23:41,891
She has no rights
in the Peshwa family.

1289
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:44,485
But l do... And l'm demanding it.

1290
02:23:45,864 --> 02:23:47,695
As the lady of this house.

1291
02:23:49,301 --> 02:23:50,325
Stamp this.

1292
02:23:56,675 --> 02:23:58,802
Take this to Nana Saheb right away.

1293
02:24:31,476 --> 02:24:33,444
What is the news from Ravelkhedi?

1294
02:24:33,712 --> 02:24:38,649
How is the Peshwa?

1295
02:24:39,384 --> 02:24:41,511
l too await news of him.

1296
02:24:41,853 --> 02:24:44,378
Until then, pray for him.

1297
02:24:47,359 --> 02:24:52,854
(Prayers )

1298
02:25:24,796 --> 02:25:26,991
What is the message?

1299
02:25:27,265 --> 02:25:34,671
Grandmother has ordered
Mastani's release.

1300
02:25:50,989 --> 02:25:52,513
Where are you going, Bajirao?

1301
02:25:52,590 --> 02:25:53,887
Look, Shaniwar Wada is on fire!

1302
02:25:53,958 --> 02:25:55,687
No, it isn't...

1303
02:25:55,994 --> 02:26:00,328
Bajirao, this isn't Pune...
We are in Ravelkhedi.

1304
02:26:00,732 --> 02:26:02,495
You are burning up!

1305
02:26:02,567 --> 02:26:03,591
Mastani!

1306
02:26:04,569 --> 02:26:07,470
She is on her way, Bajirao.

1307
02:26:08,807 --> 02:26:11,640
You've been advised bed rest.

1308
02:26:31,896 --> 02:26:32,863
Bajirao!

1309
02:26:32,931 --> 02:26:35,491
The enemy...

1310
02:26:36,568 --> 02:26:37,728
No one's there!

1311
02:26:37,802 --> 02:26:41,294
Enemy with black flags!

1312
02:26:41,806 --> 02:26:43,000
Which enemy?

1313
02:26:43,308 --> 02:26:44,707
Destiny...

1314
02:26:45,844 --> 02:26:47,368
God...

1315
02:26:48,446 --> 02:26:50,641
Can't take Mastani away.

1316
02:26:54,886 --> 02:26:56,683
Bajirao...

1317
02:27:17,809 --> 02:27:22,269
We shall meet when the setting sun
and rising moon appear together in the sky.

1318
02:29:41,619 --> 02:29:47,285
The sky will change colour, and
all will be bathed in an orange glow.

1319
02:30:08,379 --> 02:30:12,440
Winds of desire will blow, And
thundering clouds will fill the skies.

1320
02:30:47,485 --> 02:30:51,649
Dry leaves will murmur and
untimely rains will wash the earth.

1321
02:31:06,537 --> 02:31:10,871
There will be no shackles of religion
or relationships to tear us apart.

1322
02:31:12,744 --> 02:31:15,770
All that will remain will
be the fire of love in our hearts...

1323
02:31:16,881 --> 02:31:20,715
On that day...
We will become one for eternity.

1324
02:32:15,807 --> 02:32:19,573
Our hearts beat together, Mastani.

1325
02:32:20,812 --> 02:32:23,280
And cease together, too.

1326
02:32:38,796 --> 02:32:42,892
On a day when fate
and time stood witness...

1327
02:32:42,967 --> 02:32:47,028
... Two star crossed
lovers breathed their last.

1328
02:32:47,538 --> 02:32:51,941
They say witnessing a falling
star fulfills any wish...

1329
02:32:52,477 --> 02:32:58,939
...But these two stars fell to earth
wishing only to belong to each other.

1330
02:32:59,350 --> 02:33:01,409
They stand testament
to eternal love...

1331
02:33:01,486 --> 02:33:03,681
Love, that knows no religion.

1332
02:33:04,255 --> 02:33:07,554
Love that is a gift from God...
Love that in itself is Supreme.
