1
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,240
I thought this time
you'd be captured...

2
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,568
or that I'd lose you.

3
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:25,835
To whom?

4
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,472
Roma?

5
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,247
The disc which you gave the police?

6
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,442
It's a fake.

7
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,217
There was nothing in it.

8
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,316
Don't worry sweetheart...

9
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,721
now I rule over the Asian underworld.

10
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,816
I am the King!

11
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,666
It's been five years since that day.

12
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:51,669
And I... Don... rule
over the Asian drug trade.

13
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,330
The King.

14
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,799
Now my target is Europe.

15
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,505
The European drug
cartel is aware that...

16
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,412
I will takeover their market
by undercutting the prices.

17
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,478
Once I establish my
presence in Europe...

18
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,216
they will be out of business.

19
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,283
You speak to me like that again...

20
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,447
I will have my man
here slit your throat!

21
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,717
How dare you speak to me...

22
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,122
I speak the way I want.

23
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:15,819
Gentlemen...

24
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,223
gents...

25
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,664
This is Jimmy Coogan...

26
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,427
this cartel's boss.

27
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,432
He has brought everyone together...

28
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,404
so that they can set aside
their personal issues...

29
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,704
and decide about my fate.

30
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,574
All those in favour of killing Don?

31
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:40,744
Very well then!

32
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,221
I learnt about this
meeting a little late.

33
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:35,401
Every heart is beating fast

34
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:42,540
guess who is here

35
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,673
Don.

36
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:10,407
Jaruwan says he is grateful
to see you at his door again.

37
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,205
I'm not here for Jaruwan's door...

38
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,337
but for my consignment.

39
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,778
There goes your consignment.

40
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,513
Damn!

41
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,780
Now I'll have to drive the boat.

42
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,256
You aren't going anywhere, Don.

43
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,262
What brings about this hospitality?

44
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,223
Jimmy Coogan.

45
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,667
If we want to enter
the drug trade in Europe...

46
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,229
your life is our ticket.

47
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,904
And I guess he is
the ticket collector.

48
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,439
Hello big boy!

49
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:46,871
Any last wish?

50
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,710
Which restaurant in Bangkok
serves the best italian meal?

51
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,179
Meaning?

52
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:55,379
Well, after killing all of you,

53
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,816
I was hoping to go for
a good italian dinner.

54
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,258
You know, spaghetti bolognese,
a glass of red wine...

55
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,824
No? What?

56
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,320
Nobody likes italian?

57
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:05,622
What a shame!

58
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,480
See you around.

59
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,136
Hi!

60
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,201
Good evening.
- Hi Roma!

61
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:06,771
Hi!

62
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,177
Is this the file I'd asked for?

63
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,305
Yes.

64
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,474
Thanks.

65
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,345
It's him!

66
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,687
Any plans for tonight?

67
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,625
Nothing, why?

68
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,718
Because it's your birthday.

69
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,162
We should celebrate.

70
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,225
My birthday?

71
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,336
It's not my birthday today, Arjun.

72
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,631
I know.

73
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,501
Actually it's my birthday.

74
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,177
Oh my God! I'm so sorry...

75
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,649
I completely forgot!

76
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,546
Happy birthday, Arjun.

77
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:49,712
Thanks.

78
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,314
Just a second.

79
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,182
Hello...

80
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,126
I'll be right there.

81
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,421
Okay.

82
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,133
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

83
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,499
You wanted to see me, sir?

84
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:09,866
Yes.

85
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,671
Have a seat.

86
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:18,574
Roma, do you know how long
I've served in this department?

87
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:22,779
37 years.

88
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:28,490
And in these 37 years
I've worked on 186 cases.

89
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:31,658
I've worked with very
brave and able officers.

90
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:38,497
But I know I'll miss you the most.

91
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,734
I'm sorry, sir?

92
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,675
I'm retiring, Roma.

93
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,436
What?
- Yes.

94
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,277
I wanted to tell you myself.

95
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,183
Come on, I'm not dying!

96
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,683
Come...

97
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,387
walk me to my car.

98
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,422
Sir... you could reconsider
your decision...

99
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,423
I don't want to.

100
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,361
What about Don?

101
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,229
He is the only one who got away!

102
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,338
He is your responsibility now.

103
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,537
And I know you will do it.

104
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,509
Good evening, Mr. Malik.

105
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,245
Don?

106
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,221
Put your hands up!
Up where I can see them.

107
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,716
Take it easy guys...

108
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,317
Down on your knees!

109
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,362
Really? I'm wearing white!

110
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,159
Shut up and get down on your knees.

111
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,532
I am very happy to see
you too, my wild cat.

112
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,762
Watch it!

113
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,806
Why is every one so angry?

114
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,473
Absolute immunity.

115
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,677
Drop all charges against me.

116
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:01,415
In Malaysia and in every country
where there's a warrant out for me.

117
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,550
You're a wanted man in every country!

118
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,222
How can I convince them all?

119
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,384
Really?

120
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,728
My mother would've been
so proud to hear that.

121
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:13,757
Proud?

122
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,492
She would've shot you herself!

123
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,797
Mr. Malik, you didn't know my mother.

124
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,772
Immunity or nothing!

125
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:29,312
Don, that's impossible!

126
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:32,283
I could probably save
you from the death penalty.

127
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,409
That's all!

128
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:37,845
The names of my clients, my
suppliers, every one involved...

129
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,281
for all that
information and evidence...

130
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,418
your offer is quite small, Mr. Malik.

131
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,728
Do something about it.

132
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,290
You know...

133
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,493
Make me an offer I can't refuse.

134
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,528
Okay.

135
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,296
If you don't cooperate with us...

136
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,834
believe me, along
with the prison term.

137
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,711
You'll also get the death penalty.

138
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,616
We all die, Mr. Malik.

139
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:10,179
Perhaps going to jail now
will be to my advantage.

140
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,742
I've waited far too
long for this day.

141
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:44,284
How does it feel... to be in prison?

142
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:45,849
Yeah, it's okay.

143
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,716
I'm unhappy with the
uniform colour but...

144
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,761
you don't look happy either.

145
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,162
What is it?

146
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:59,166
Your unexpected change of heart...

147
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,365
why are you putting on this act?

148
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:07,543
In this trade, when people covet
your death more than your life...

149
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,441
it's understood that
it's time to move on.

150
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,285
I figured I'd do something
good along the way but...

151
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,151
you people didn't give me a chance.

152
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,289
Very sad!

153
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:20,884
Had we given you that chance...

154
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,158
...you would've provided us
with the actual information...

155
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:25,652
Isn't that right?

156
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,255
Yeah, that's right.

157
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,658
I've lied to you once before...

158
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,529
and I didn't like it.

159
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,696
Shut up!

160
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:39,142
Your anger belies
what is in your heart.

161
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:41,906
What?

162
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,139
Roma, all that happened...

163
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,345
most of all I regret that...

164
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,213
I betrayed you.

165
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:57,862
For once, I wanted to
see you behind bars...

166
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,456
and now I have.

167
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,301
So goodbye, Don!

168
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,529
If you let me live, it
would be your biggest mistake.

169
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,511
Welcome to hell, Don.

170
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,648
Shower 14's drain is clogged.

171
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,287
Inform housekeeping.

172
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:45,864
Still upset?

173
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,645
I'm here to offer my friendship.

174
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,480
Let go of the past.

175
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:05,781
Let go of what?

176
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:10,150
I've been trapped in this cage
for five years thanks to you!

177
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,523
You're here because
of your ego, Vardhaan.

178
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,428
You don't know how to change
with time and circumstance.

179
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,864
Come on!

180
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,232
Come on!

181
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,365
Get up!

182
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,505
If you know, then
what are you doing here?

183
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,682
I've come here for you, Vardhaan.

184
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,378
With an offer.

185
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,316
Well, I have an offer too.

186
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,657
How about I cut you to pieces
and feed you to the dogs in here?

187
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,490
That will benefit
neither you nor me, Vardhaan.

188
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,132
Only the dogs!

189
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,504
And I hate dogs!

190
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,369
I'm on death row, Vardhaan.

191
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,143
Whether you kill me now or
the law does in two weeks...

192
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,571
it's all the same.

193
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,475
Think, Vardhaan!

194
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,316
I could have surrendered
myself in any country...

195
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:11,314
yet I chose this one.

196
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,486
Though I know you are here,
eager to kill me.

197
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,304
Don!

198
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,882
Get out of here! All of you... out!

199
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,650
Go on...

200
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:51,252
I've come to help you escape.

201
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,893
In exchange for?

202
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,131
You'll know when the time is right.

203
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,293
No, no...

204
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,637
You will tell me right now!

205
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,469
All you need to do
right now is to decide...

206
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,103
...whether you want
to escape or not...

207
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,806
If this is another of your tricks...

208
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,207
Trust me, no tricks.

209
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,650
What do I have to do?

210
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,246
Good.

211
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:21,449
Two days later, the kitchen
supplies are going to be delivered.

212
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:50,346
You see him?

213
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,414
I want that janitor's duty.

214
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,752
- Okay, but...
- Do it, please.

215
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,226
Okay.

216
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,336
Now what?

217
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,704
Now we wait till Saturday.

218
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,910
Why? What happens on Saturday?

219
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,675
My attorney will pay me a visit.

220
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,151
Any more questions?

221
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,248
Yes, one more. May I ask?

222
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,392
No! Got your answer?

223
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:31,920
Good night.

224
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,284
Tonight we get out of here...

225
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,350
you ready?
- Oh yes!

226
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,240
Hey, you want to eat my food?

227
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,208
- You don't want?
- Hate fish!

228
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,660
Help!

229
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,287
He's dying, we need help here.

230
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,289
He's dying.

231
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,764
Thank you... My friend is very sick.

232
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,364
Hi...

233
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,603
Hi.

234
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,269
Hope I'm not disturbing you?

235
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:08,774
No, not at all.

236
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,344
Are those for me?

237
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:14,610
Yeah!

238
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,722
- Come in.
- Thanks.

239
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,417
Who is this?

240
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,423
My brother...

241
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:28,758
Ramesh.

242
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,163
Your brother...

243
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:34,330
where is he?

244
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,536
He's dead.

245
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,149
I am sorry.

246
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:49,478
That's okay.

247
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:58,785
Roma, remember you
once told me that...

248
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,856
you didn't want to think about
anything else till Don was arrested?

249
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,227
I do.

250
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:09,697
Well now the situation is...

251
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,449
that your phone is ringing yet again.

252
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,120
I am sorry... just a second...

253
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:25,647
Hello?

254
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,123
When?

255
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:11,091
Mesmerising and alluring.

256
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:19,372
Is his magic.

257
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:40,630
Mesmerising and alluring.

258
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:48,802
Is his magic.

259
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,803
He whose eyes are stars.

260
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,709
He who is adorned with diamonds.

261
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:02,685
O heart, is it true?

262
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,780
O tell me.

263
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:11,386
He is here.

264
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:16,400
Hold on to your heart,
say it out loud.

265
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:20,332
Guess who it is.

266
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:26,708
He is here, once again

267
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:30,342
Don

268
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:54,500
I'm the mystery that no one gets.

269
00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:03,345
My moves are above everyone else

270
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:24,091
I'm the mystery that no one gets.

271
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:32,403
My moves are above everyone else

272
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,544
I'm deeper than the ocean

273
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:41,148
never standing still

274
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:46,657
I'm denser than smoke

275
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:54,696
that never stops rising.

276
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:59,666
Hold on to your heart,
say it out loud.

277
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,732
Guess who it is.

278
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:10,338
He is here, once again

279
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:14,714
Don.

280
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:43,774
You aren't like smoke,
you are the flame.

281
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:51,345
If I come closer to you,
I'll burn and die.

282
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:54,516
If it's me you desire,
what else will you get?

283
00:29:55,126 --> 00:30:01,531
Where do I go next,
even I don't have a clue.

284
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:06,468
Hold on to your heart,
say it out loud.

285
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:10,372
Guess who it is.

286
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:17,210
He is here, once again

287
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:21,480
Don

288
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,055
Don.

289
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,696
Here! Now this is
what I want from you.

290
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,338
There's a safety deposit box in
Zurich's Russian Commercial bank...

291
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:49,206
that belonged to your ex-boss, Boris.

292
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:52,942
He gave one of the set
of keys to you and...

293
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,181
...the other to your partner,
Singhania.

294
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,687
I have one key, thanks to you.

295
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,481
Come to think of it, if you had
taken the key from Singhania...

296
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:01,752
either before
poisoning him or even after...

297
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,351
it would've been to your advantage.

298
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:05,423
What's in that box?

299
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,662
You will know when we open it.

300
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,693
Where is the key, Vardhaan?

301
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,634
Zurich Airport.

302
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,342
Baggage locker number 1-3-5.

303
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,711
Combination lock number 5-4-8-1-7.

304
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:28,215
Got it.

305
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,246
Sweetheart, take the
next flight out to Zurich.

306
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,390
We'll see you there in two days.

307
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:39,591
You trust this girl completely?

308
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,558
Ayesha.

309
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,165
Sorry?

310
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,538
Ayesha, my name.

311
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,666
You were saying...

312
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,571
I was wondering if a girl
like you should do something...

313
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:58,777
...as dangerous as this!

314
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:02,715
I'm not just a pretty face,
Mr. Vardhaan.

315
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:05,653
I have a lot of other skills too.

316
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,451
See you in Zurich.

317
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:10,886
See ya.

318
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,246
Welcome to Zurich.

319
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:16,788
Know him?

320
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:21,424
Fabian Kohl.

321
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,391
President of the
German Deutsch Zentral Bank.

322
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,170
Influential, powerful
and respected by all.

323
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,140
Not many know that the
position he has occupied

324
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,441
for the past eight years...

325
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,735
was meant for someone else.

326
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,438
Who?

327
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,514
When the committee was setup to
choose the bank's president...

328
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,479
their first choice wasn't Kohl
but someone else.

329
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,219
James Werden.

330
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:46,915
So why didn't
the committee elect Werden?

331
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,425
Werden was killed in a car accident.

332
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:56,195
Kohl was behind that accident.

333
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,562
Guess who helped him?

334
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:04,397
Singhania?

335
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,639
That's right, Vardhaan!

336
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,415
But Kohl's messenger
wasn't aware that...

337
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:16,252
Singhania had recorded
their meeting in this tape.

338
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,213
Are we going to blackmail Kohl?

339
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:23,183
Yes and no.

340
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,886
I will blackmail Kohl...

341
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:30,362
through the bank's vice-president,
J. K. Diwan.

342
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,594
The vice-president
of DZB is an indian?

343
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:39,265
Well sweetheart, we are everywhere.

344
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,672
Why don't we deal with Kohl directly?

345
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:49,182
A minister is more concerned
about power than the king himself.

346
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:54,289
Kohl's messenger to
Singhania was none other than Diwan.

347
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:58,825
What's on your mind?

348
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,596
DZB has its currency
centre here in Berlin.

349
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,127
And that is where they print
the 50 and 100 Euro bills.

350
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,168
How much are we demanding?

351
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:12,835
I don't want the money!

352
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:14,636
Then what?

353
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:18,782
I want the printing plates!

354
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,483
Why on earth would
Diwan give us those plates?

355
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,481
Blackmail or no blackmail,
he will be finished, right?

356
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:26,649
Right!

357
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:28,121
Therefore it's important

358
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:31,628
to keep Fabian Kohl and
Diwan out of the picture.

359
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,756
But how?

360
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:39,260
With Diwan's help I'll
break into the currency centre.

361
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:50,209
Even if you do steal the plates,
it's no big deal to make new ones.

362
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:51,578
Of course it's no
big deal, sweetheart.

363
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:55,752
But new bills don't
make old ones worthless.

364
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,852
By the time the bank
replaces every old bill...

365
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,281
it will be years.

366
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:04,490
By then... how should I say this...

367
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,193
we will be...

368
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,525
billionaires!

369
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,233
Yes sir? - Roma, I just had
a word with German interpol.

370
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:20,642
Roma, I just had a word
with German interpol.

371
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:24,812
Vardhaan and Don
were spotted in Zurich.

372
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,543
Don and Vardhaan?

373
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:28,852
What were they doing together?

374
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,719
That's what we need to find out.

375
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:34,387
The car they were travelling in was
found at a lonely spot in Berlin...

376
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,454
Leave for Berlin immediately.

377
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:37,886
Right away, sir.

378
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:41,461
I have spoken with the Director
of intelligence, Klaus Wetland.

379
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:44,396
He is attending a
charity fundraiser tomorrow.

380
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,368
Right.
- He'll meet you there.

381
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,133
All the best.

382
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,337
Okay, sir. Thank you!

383
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:06,515
Excuse me, gentlemen...

384
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:07,848
Mr. Wetland?

385
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,217
Roma Bhagat.

386
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,817
Detective Malik may have
spoken to you about me.

387
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:12,255
Yes, he did.

388
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,191
This is Detective Jens Berkel.

389
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,729
He will be working the case with you.

390
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:17,464
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

391
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:23,304
Detective Malik wanted me to
personally thank you for all your help.

392
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,774
Tell Malik, he owes me one.

393
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,337
Big time!

394
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,472
I will, sir.

395
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:31,811
Good evening ladies and gentlemen.

396
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,112
Thank you all for
being here with us today...

397
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,878
and putting your heart
ahead of your wallet.

398
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,851
Would you please join me
to welcome here today...

399
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:42,689
our esteemed guest of honour...

400
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,194
the Vice President of the DZB...

401
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,356
Mr. J.K. Diwan.

402
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,651
We raise our glasses to your health.

403
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:11,813
Cheers!

404
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,579
Cheers!
- Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

405
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,326
Enjoy the rest of the evening.

406
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,594
Thank you.

407
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,283
What happened?

408
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:03,317
That man...

409
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,396
I don't know why but I
feel like I know him.

410
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,689
Only if he didn't look like he did...

411
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:11,292
I am sure...

412
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,263
Find him, Arjun.

413
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,345
It is extremely important because
if it wasn't for your support...

414
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:23,903
we would never be
able to raise any funds.

415
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,314
Your phone is ringing.

416
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:28,713
- My phone?
- Yeah.

417
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:37,453
Excuse me.

418
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:38,887
Hello?

419
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,687
Congratulations on
the new phone, Diwan.

420
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,394
The inbox has a video clip...

421
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:45,458
which I'm sure
you'll find interesting.

422
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,928
I suggest you see it alone...

423
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:52,175
or it could prove embarrassing.

424
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,155
I kept my word.

425
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:09,852
Now it's your turn.

426
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:12,186
Once Mr. Werden is
elected as president...

427
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,154
it will be
difficult to make our move.

428
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:15,528
Don't worry, it will be done.

429
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:23,203
I told you it was interesting.

430
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,700
Apart from this clip,
I also have a bank document.

431
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,371
It states that a million
dollars were transferred...

432
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:32,540
...to Singhania's Swiss bank account.

433
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,709
- Singhania? I don't know any...
- Signed by you!

434
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:40,156
It is your good
fortune that I am a nice guy.

435
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:44,319
What I want is no big deal for you.

436
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:49,326
There's a black car outside,
registration number BIU 103.

437
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,458
You have...

438
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:52,527
two minutes.

439
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,392
Who are you?

440
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:36,671
Don?

441
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,316
No autographs please!

442
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,785
Damn it! Get the car!

443
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,350
You are crazy!

444
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,187
Do you have any idea
what you're asking for?

445
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:52,386
Of course.

446
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,363
I want the information that
will help me get inside...

447
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:56,194
...the underground vault of the DZB.

448
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,226
Listen... if you want money...

449
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,937
please just name your amount,
you will get it.

450
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:02,934
What you're asking for is impossible.

451
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:05,873
Would you and Fabian
Kohl rather spend..

452
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,877
...the rest of your lives in prison?

453
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:12,673
The details of what I
want are on the phone.

454
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:14,809
And Diwan...

455
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,586
you have 24 hours.

456
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,432
Roma! There!

457
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:54,215
I see you... my wild cat.

458
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,663
Don! If I'm caught with you...
- Relax Diwan.

459
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,429
It is not just
difficult to catch Don...

460
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,199
It's impossible!

461
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:07,083
Roma he's gone.

462
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:09,683
Are you alright?

463
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:12,118
Everybody okay?

464
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:13,653
Step aside sir.

465
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,259
Police business.
Step away from the car!

466
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,632
It's my car...

467
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,775
Get out! Please!

468
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:33,878
Got any money?

469
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,412
There he is.

470
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,463
Times up, sorry Roma.

471
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,632
See you soon.

472
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,177
Hello.

473
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:18,346
A moment please sir.

474
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:21,590
Sorry, I have to go.

475
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:27,690
This will destroy us.

476
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,226
Do what ever you have to do Diwan.

477
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:35,737
I don't want to hear about
that man, Don, ever again.

478
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,366
Is that understood?

479
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:19,308
So Mr. Diwan...

480
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,842
how can Abdul
Jabbar be of assistance?

481
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:26,752
I've heard you are a useful man.

482
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:31,385
You've heard right.

483
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,288
What's the job?

484
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:36,628
You know of Don, of course?

485
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:38,393
Hmm...

486
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,666
He is in Berlin right now.

487
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:43,232
I want you to trace him down and...

488
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,334
you know...

489
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:57,845
Why?

490
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:01,950
Why do you want him killed,
Mr. Diwan?

491
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:05,120
You need reason or money?

492
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,195
Now you're talking!

493
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,238
Five million Euro.

494
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:20,903
Half now and...

495
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,811
the rest when I hand you his head.

496
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:26,308
That's not necessary.

497
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:31,880
I want it done. As soon as possible!

498
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:46,760
Vardhaan!

499
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,895
Now do you see why
we never get along?

500
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:54,877
It would be better if
instead of watching cartoons...

501
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,776
you were thinking about
the security at the DZB.

502
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:58,506
Really?

503
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,277
Even if Diwan does help...

504
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:03,550
stealing those plates from
the DZB won't be a cakewalk.

505
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:04,849
I know, Vardhaan.

506
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:09,522
We need a computer hacker to control
the building's security system.

507
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,294
My remote, please.

508
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:16,128
Thank you!

509
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:17,257
But who?

510
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:19,427
All our useful men are
either in prison or...

511
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,230
on the FBI and interpol watch list.

512
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,732
Relax Vardhaan.

513
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:29,672
I know just the guy for this task.

514
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:36,583
Hey! Watch out!

515
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:37,710
Are you crazy?

516
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:51,761
Thank you for coming, Sameer.

517
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,234
Not at all, sir, please... I mean...

518
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:57,268
I had to see for myself that
it really was you who called.

519
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,705
I'm just a big fan, sir.

520
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,205
Sir?

521
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,271
That sounds too 'honest'.

522
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:05,806
Call me Don.

523
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:07,477
I have a job for you.

524
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,350
The security system
at the DZB's currency centre...

525
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:15,550
is controlled by a master computer.

526
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,317
I want you to hack
into this computer...

527
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:21,523
so that it's under my control.

528
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,362
I'm really sorry sir... Don.

529
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,432
I don't think I can do it.

530
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:33,801
Really?

531
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:36,802
Is it the Sameer Ali
who at 17 hacked into...

532
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,144
...the Tokyo Stock Exchange
and stole 1.4 million dollars?

533
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:42,677
And then donated it anonymously
to 'Save the Oceans' foundation.

534
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,812
There's nothing to
prove that I did it.

535
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,914
And if there's no evidence,
you aren't guilty.

536
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:50,653
Isn't that right?

537
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,520
Toucha!

538
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:57,565
You've been quite low
key the past three years.

539
00:53:58,301 --> 00:53:59,427
I'm sure love has
something to do with it.

540
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:03,529
Actually tell me...
I like love stories.

541
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:06,207
She is a...

542
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,471
she's very special.

543
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,178
I am sure she is.

544
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:12,873
But so is your talent.

545
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:18,185
It would be a shame not to
put it to use at right time.

546
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:22,152
I can't.

547
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:28,297
I promised Yana that
I won't do anything illegal.

548
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:34,429
If there's no evidence,
you aren't guilty, right?

549
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:53,314
Hey...

550
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:56,884
where were you?

551
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:59,354
I had the interview, remember?

552
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:02,421
Oh yeah, how did it go?

553
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,090
I got the job, Yana.

554
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:09,498
That's great, Sam.

555
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:14,535
How are you feeling?

556
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:17,210
I feel good.

557
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:20,476
A little bit tired... but good.

558
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,347
He's not troubling
you too much, is he?

559
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:25,314
No. He's very well behaved.

560
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,675
Listen, Yana... I have to go
away for a couple of weeks.

561
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:56,348
There's a software expo in Amsterdam.

562
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,383
My love, it's not about
what you thinking it is...

563
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,156
I'm done with that life.

564
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:07,459
What's important to me
is you and the baby.

565
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:10,198
And I won't let
anything come between us.

566
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:27,777
At 1:18pm...

567
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:29,478
there are two people in the car.

568
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,418
Exactly 6 minutes later...

569
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,487
Here, look carefully.

570
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:40,754
Only one!

571
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:43,765
That means the passenger got off...

572
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:46,700
somewhere between
Tiergarten Strasse...

573
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:50,304
and 17th Juli Strasse.

574
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:54,170
Probably someone saw
him get out of the car.

575
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:57,802
Possible.

576
00:56:58,748 --> 00:56:59,874
I'll talk to Berkel.

577
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:03,485
If there's a witness, we'll find him.

578
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:10,217
Hello...

579
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:13,626
Diwan, I'm sure you are
impressed by my punctuality.

580
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:16,627
So, what have you decided?

581
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:18,596
I'm willing to give
you what you want.

582
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:20,727
Good.

583
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:23,662
Tomorrow morning at 8,
outside the Berlin Cathedral.

584
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:30,109
Now what?

585
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,545
You will do exactly
as he wants you to.

586
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:33,407
What do you mean?

587
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:37,352
I can't give him that information!

588
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,678
Who said it has to be real?

589
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,485
By the time Don figures it out...

590
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,454
he will be dead, Mr. Diwan.

591
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:01,701
Hello?

592
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:04,611
A sightseeing bus is
approaching from your left.

593
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:06,473
I see it.

594
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:08,483
It will stop in front of you.

595
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:10,784
Come to the upper deck!

596
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:20,621
Let's go.

597
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:44,651
Everything you've asked
for is in these discs.

598
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,752
The blueprints of the currency
centre, security protocols and...

599
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,397
all codes to access the building.

600
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,629
What about the safe
containing the plates?

601
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:02,631
That safe is in the
underground vault.

602
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:06,073
It can only be opened by
a passkey which is in...

603
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:10,176
...the custody of the centre's
chief technician, Dr. Schneider.

604
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,672
Anything else?

605
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,841
Apart from the passkey,
the safe also requires...

606
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:20,152
Dr. Schneider's
fingerprints and voice match.

607
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,763
Look honestly,
you've got to trust me.

608
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:31,197
I'm telling you the truth.

609
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:33,667
You have beautiful eyes...

610
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:36,136
I trust you.

611
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,676
Keep this phone on you.

612
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:43,870
You have a reservation
at the Hotel de Rome.

613
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:46,712
Stay there until my next call.

614
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:50,878
But what about the
tape and documents?

615
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,649
Relax Diwan.

616
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:56,723
You'll get what you deserve.

617
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:03,616
Take the stairs.

618
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,232
Karl, you stay here.

619
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:48,395
Yeah.

620
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,691
You!!

621
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:34,669
Jabbar...

622
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,212
Don may not keep in
touch with his friends...

623
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:41,678
but he always checks on his enemies.

624
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:57,857
Someone is following you, sir.

625
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,231
Thanks, Sameer.

626
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,337
You want this, right?

627
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:03,864
No, Don.

628
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:06,866
I want to kill you.

629
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:11,246
We seem to have a problem.

630
01:04:11,714 --> 01:04:12,772
You see...

631
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:15,680
I prefer to stay alive.

632
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:19,713
I think you'll have to
change your intention.

633
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:25,159
I suggest you join with me.

634
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:29,195
Whatever money Diwan
has promised you...

635
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:30,899
I'll give you three times more.

636
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:34,261
Think about it.

637
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:37,263
I don't want to put you...

638
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:41,199
under any pressure!

639
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:51,677
We found someone.

640
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:52,846
That's great!

641
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:55,447
Someone at the station
has identified Don's car.

642
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:57,921
And he also got a good look
at the person who got out.

643
01:04:58,494 --> 01:04:59,791
Super! Where is he?

644
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:00,921
He's with the sketch artist.

645
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:03,324
Okay, let me know when
the sketch is complete.

646
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:04,557
Alright then.

647
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:05,860
Arjun!

648
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:08,530
Good job.

649
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:09,627
Thanks.

650
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,121
Don...

651
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:34,660
Including Jabbar in our
plan was a big mistake.

652
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:36,130
- Really?
- Really.

653
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:39,157
Have you forgotten that
he was hired to kill you?

654
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:45,264
Don's enemies should always
remember that Don never forgets.

655
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:48,708
As for my mistake...

656
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:52,737
this Abdul Jabbar will be
our ticket to escape from DZB.

657
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:54,274
Meaning?

658
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:55,408
I mean...

659
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:57,279
My plan to get us
out of the building...

660
01:05:57,353 --> 01:06:00,186
will be a success only if...

661
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:05,122
we sacrifice Abdul
Jabbar and his goons.

662
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:14,826
Hello sweetheart!

663
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:31,445
Is he dead?

664
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,612
No, but you are!

665
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:37,152
Don? - Diwan, being
stupid enough to give me..

666
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:38,887
...blank discs is one thing...

667
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,660
but to hire assassins to kill me...

668
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:43,692
now that will be your downfall.

669
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,292
Please Don!

670
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:46,860
Don please...

671
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:48,228
please forgive me!

672
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:49,762
I'm sorry I screwed up.

673
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:50,897
I'll give you what you want.

674
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:52,299
Anything you ask of me!

675
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:54,370
Where is the information I want?

676
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:57,768
I have it with me, Don. It's with me.

677
01:06:58,214 --> 01:06:59,272
Open the door.

678
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:01,809
Knock knock...

679
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:07,281
Sir, did you order room service?

680
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,123
Say 'yes'.

681
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:11,122
Yes, I...

682
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:12,419
I ordered room service.

683
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:24,738
But you...

684
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:26,365
Give her the information.

685
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:41,414
I have got it.

686
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:46,658
As a penalty you'll have to do
another thing for me, Diwan.

687
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:48,655
Wait...

688
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:50,696
Wait for my call.

689
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:54,691
That's him.

690
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:00,803
I've seen him before...

691
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:06,740
Where...

692
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,651
He was at the charity fund raiser...

693
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:15,283
his name... the guest of honour...

694
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:17,824
J. K. Diwan.
- That's it!

695
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,618
The Vice-President of the DZB.

696
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:20,720
Isn't it?

697
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:22,093
Yeah, you are right.

698
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:25,798
But... what was he
doing in the car with Don?

699
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:27,596
That's what we have to find out!

700
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:52,386
Okay!

701
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:56,358
This building has
state of the art security!

702
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:58,527
But obviously that's..

703
01:08:58,701 --> 01:08:59,895
...not news to you.

704
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,597
Can you control
their computers or not?

705
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:06,872
Since you have put your trust
in me, I can't let you down.

706
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:12,472
I can control everything
except the underground vault.

707
01:09:12,849 --> 01:09:13,941
What about the vault?

708
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:16,541
The vault isn't linked
to the master computer.

709
01:09:16,953 --> 01:09:19,717
It's controls are in
the vault's enclosure.

710
01:09:21,057 --> 01:09:24,652
The electric supply to the
vault is from a remote source.

711
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:28,423
Okay, we'll deal with that.

712
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,328
We'll figure the
vault from the inside.

713
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:33,728
Sir...

714
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:36,496
Yeah?

715
01:09:36,973 --> 01:09:38,065
You see...

716
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:41,306
I don't mean to
demoralise anyone but...

717
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:45,313
we should realise
what we're up against.

718
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:53,255
As soon as you enter DZB is
the first security check point...

719
01:09:53,456 --> 01:09:55,515
metal detectors, baggage x-ray.

720
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:58,784
A little ahead is the lobby
with CCTV cameras all over

721
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,852
and these are
monitored round the clock

722
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,955
by security guards in
the surveillance room.

723
01:10:06,336 --> 01:10:08,600
There's a door to enter the vault...

724
01:10:08,838 --> 01:10:11,329
which can be opened by a password.

725
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,835
The stairs inside lead
to the underground vault.

726
01:10:14,344 --> 01:10:18,838
At the foot is a metal gate
manned by two security guards.

727
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:22,613
If you manage to get past them...

728
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:25,783
you'll reach the first
entrance to the printing chamber.

729
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,751
The security guards
will have the key to that.

730
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:30,953
The real problem lies ahead.

731
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:32,819
The main vault.

732
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:35,455
It is a sold steel chamber.

733
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:40,562
The emergency procedure is to lock
the door and smash the controls.

734
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,872
I mean, it's
impossible to get through it.

735
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:47,676
Fine, we'll blow it up.

736
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:50,472
No way, sir. Please don't
even think of that. - Why not?

737
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,972
Because there are two
things that will happen..

738
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,274
...If you try to blow it open.

739
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:56,776
First...

740
01:10:56,986 --> 01:10:59,682
a chemical gas will
release into the chamber.

741
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:04,382
The gas isn't lethal but it can
knock a person out for 12 hours.

742
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:06,486
The second thing?

743
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:10,388
The vault door and the safe are
separated by a 20 foot long passage.

744
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,330
Now the floor of this passage is
installed with a security system...

745
01:11:13,403 --> 01:11:15,894
that is activated by
even the slightest pressure.

746
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:19,371
What happens if the
system is activated?

747
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:21,769
I don't know, sir. But...

748
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:26,841
if I were you, I
wouldn't even breathe

749
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:53,671
Karl, Jabbar and his
team of five will wait here.

750
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:58,510
Two of you go up and wait for us
on the fifth floor by this window.

751
01:11:58,948 --> 01:12:00,245
Jabbar...

752
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:03,945
explosives, guns,
ammunition are your domain.

753
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:07,283
There is no night.

754
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:11,921
And no day here.

755
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:14,954
Is it the darkness.

756
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:16,362
This is Dr. Schneider.

757
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:18,028
I want his finger prints.

758
01:12:22,305 --> 01:12:29,040
The eyes are
betrayed but nobody knows.

759
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:35,275
Wonder what is here and isn't.

760
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,615
Good afternoon, this is
Detective Baruah from interpol.

761
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:39,845
May I speak with Dr.
Schneider please?

762
01:12:41,424 --> 01:12:42,823
Good afternoon. Dr. Schneider?

763
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:46,294
Yes, I am Diedrich Schneider.
- Thank you.

764
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:48,755
There are many fake ones
like this out on the street.

765
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:51,595
Could I have the test
results by say, Tuesday?

766
01:12:52,235 --> 01:12:55,329
You could get it by tomorrow, if
you want. - No, Tuesday is just fine.

767
01:12:56,439 --> 01:12:57,872
Thank you, Dr. Schneider.
- Here you go.

768
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:05,806
Thank you so much.

769
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:13,687
The eyes are
betrayed but nobody knows

770
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:14,847
I am Diedrich Schneider.

771
01:13:14,924 --> 01:13:23,628
Wonder what is here and isn't.

772
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:29,772
All an illusion.

773
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:27,354
The eyes are
betrayed but nobody knows.

774
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:37,268
Wonder what is here and isn't.

775
01:14:37,607 --> 01:14:43,568
All an illusion

776
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:08,895
Don?

777
01:15:09,405 --> 01:15:10,963
How do we escape from DZB?

778
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:17,474
In the basement...
is the service exit.

779
01:15:17,947 --> 01:15:20,882
Ayesha will wait for
us in a police van.

780
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:25,509
We will escape in that van,
smooth and easy.

781
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:29,916
That's it?

782
01:15:34,497 --> 01:15:36,829
Yeah, that's it...

783
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,695
You've thought of something better?

784
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:44,631
No?

785
01:15:46,976 --> 01:15:48,273
I thought so.

786
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:54,377
Then I guess we'll have
to make do with my plan.

787
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:15,695
Hello...

788
01:16:15,805 --> 01:16:16,897
Diwan...

789
01:16:20,843 --> 01:16:21,935
tomorrow at 3...

790
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,407
behind the Paul Loebe house.

791
01:16:26,482 --> 01:16:27,779
And please...

792
01:16:29,385 --> 01:16:30,579
be on time, Diwan.

793
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:41,024
Nothing can stop me now!

794
01:16:44,734 --> 01:16:46,258
I know Don.

795
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:52,503
He can sacrifice you...

796
01:16:53,676 --> 01:16:56,201
me or anyone else for his own gain.

797
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:58,572
Is that so?

798
01:17:01,717 --> 01:17:03,878
Then what are you doing with him?

799
01:17:04,754 --> 01:17:05,846
I...

800
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:08,449
wanted to figure his plan.

801
01:17:09,592 --> 01:17:11,856
I won't make the mistake
of trusting him again.

802
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:13,360
And quite frankly Jabbar...

803
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:16,294
neither should you.

804
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:18,926
Why not?

805
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:24,535
Don's exit plan says...

806
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:29,610
you won't get out alive.

807
01:17:33,549 --> 01:17:35,540
He won't leave this place alive!

808
01:17:35,618 --> 01:17:36,710
Jabbar, calm down.

809
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:39,480
Not now, Jabbar.

810
01:17:40,456 --> 01:17:41,855
Once we have the plates.

811
01:17:43,559 --> 01:17:45,754
I must say Don's plan is pretty good.

812
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:51,899
Imagine, once we have the plates...

813
01:17:53,936 --> 01:17:55,460
it will be raining money!

814
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,532
What about Don?

815
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:04,401
By the time the cops
find Don's corpse...

816
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:09,217
we would've escaped
through the service exit.

817
01:18:12,655 --> 01:18:13,781
That's it.

818
01:18:23,599 --> 01:18:24,691
Hey.

819
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:26,993
Hey... how are you?

820
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:29,532
I'm good babe. Good.

821
01:18:30,773 --> 01:18:31,831
Just miss you.

822
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:33,467
I miss you too.

823
01:18:34,577 --> 01:18:36,511
They're working you hard...
you sound tired...

824
01:18:37,446 --> 01:18:39,277
Just a few more
days and I'll be back.

825
01:18:40,749 --> 01:18:42,341
I'm really proud of you, Sam.

826
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:44,975
You know I'm doing
this for us, right?

827
01:18:46,522 --> 01:18:47,614
I Love you.

828
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:49,254
Please take care of yourself.

829
01:18:49,758 --> 01:18:50,850
Call me, alright?

830
01:19:04,373 --> 01:19:08,309
The sketch does look
like J.K. Diwan but...

831
01:19:08,377 --> 01:19:12,609
it is also a fact that we are
relying only on one man's memory.

832
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:14,040
I know sir...

833
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:16,313
but I think he is right.

834
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:21,855
Alright, fix an appointment with him.

835
01:19:22,391 --> 01:19:23,517
Thank you, sir.

836
01:19:23,993 --> 01:19:25,290
Roma...
- Yes sir?

837
01:19:25,895 --> 01:19:28,830
Do remember that J.K. Diwan
is a very important person.

838
01:19:29,632 --> 01:19:32,430
So, word your questions delicately.

839
01:19:32,902 --> 01:19:33,960
I understand, sir.

840
01:19:45,748 --> 01:19:46,737
Hello?

841
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:53,550
Sorry you had to wait
but I need to reschedule our meeting.

842
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:55,883
Go to DZB and wait for my call.

843
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,477
Hello.
- How was the drive?

844
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:23,779
Lots of traffic but it was fine.

845
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:46,398
I'm sorry.

846
01:21:04,994 --> 01:21:06,393
Hello DZB.

847
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:08,487
Now what?

848
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:09,989
Now, we record.

849
01:21:14,837 --> 01:21:15,997
Good Morning Mr. Diwan.

850
01:21:23,846 --> 01:21:24,938
Here we go!

851
01:21:51,974 --> 01:21:53,737
Sameer, can you hear me?

852
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:55,774
Yes, Don! Loud and clear.

853
01:21:56,512 --> 01:21:57,740
Cameras... now!

854
01:21:57,946 --> 01:21:59,277
Copy that.

855
01:21:59,348 --> 01:22:01,316
I'm switching the live
video with the recording.

856
01:22:04,686 --> 01:22:07,621
Did you see that? - Now they
will see what we show them.

857
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:08,848
What's going on?

858
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:10,016
Did you see that?

859
01:22:12,528 --> 01:22:14,018
Must be a glitch!

860
01:22:40,823 --> 01:22:42,051
Good day!

861
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:49,727
Hello.
- Good afternoon, sir.

862
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:51,732
I'm here for my appointment
with Dr. Schneider, please.

863
01:22:51,834 --> 01:22:53,563
He is expecting you.

864
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:01,306
Good day! Interpol.

865
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:03,369
Oh shit!

866
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:13,421
Yes?
- Whatever you do, don't turn around.

867
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:14,780
Who is it?

868
01:23:14,857 --> 01:23:16,552
Interpol officers Roma and Malik...

869
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:18,616
get out of there!

870
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:20,786
Thank you.

871
01:23:20,863 --> 01:23:21,921
Thank you.

872
01:23:22,464 --> 01:23:23,863
He will see you now
on the fourth floor.

873
01:23:24,266 --> 01:23:25,358
Thank you very much.

874
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:28,427
Good day!

875
01:23:36,278 --> 01:23:38,439
Yes, Patricia?
- Good afternoon, sir.

876
01:23:38,714 --> 01:23:40,978
There are some officers here
from the interpol to meet you.

877
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:47,686
Send them up please... in 15 minutes.

878
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:56,789
I have the results of the analysis..

879
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,560
...on the
counterfeit bill you gave me.

880
01:23:59,768 --> 01:24:00,860
Altogether...

881
01:24:00,936 --> 01:24:04,667
there are 7 points which
confirm that it is a fake.

882
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:08,437
If you see the bluring
in the corner of the ink.

883
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:22,983
The third point which clearly
confirms that we are holding...

884
01:24:23,258 --> 01:24:24,384
...a fake note in our hands...

885
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:25,926
is the microprint.

886
01:24:26,495 --> 01:24:28,656
You see here the real one...
here's the fake one.

887
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:31,025
In the real note the microprint...

888
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:35,563
You'll come across a
ladder to your left.

889
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:37,662
Above that is the
elevator shaft ventilation duct.

890
01:24:56,358 --> 01:24:57,450
Excuse me...

891
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,255
Mr. Diwan will meet you now.

892
01:25:25,921 --> 01:25:28,549
I hope it crashes after I get off!

893
01:25:47,776 --> 01:25:48,834
Bye.

894
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:56,283
Package 1 in position.

895
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:03,686
Sam, stop the
elevator when I tell you to.

896
01:26:06,395 --> 01:26:07,487
Now!

897
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:12,558
Sir button...

898
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:39,553
The doorman at your
apartment block told us that...

899
01:26:39,628 --> 01:26:42,688
on the 15th you left your
apartment at 11 in the morning...

900
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:44,957
and returned at half past two.

901
01:26:45,467 --> 01:26:46,456
Is that right?

902
01:26:46,735 --> 01:26:47,827
The 15th...

903
01:26:49,271 --> 01:26:50,329
let me see...

904
01:26:50,472 --> 01:26:52,463
Victor, where were we on the 15th?

905
01:26:52,641 --> 01:26:54,472
Mrs. Bergman's fundraiser, sir.

906
01:26:55,243 --> 01:26:57,234
And what time did we return home?

907
01:26:57,312 --> 01:26:58,404
1:30 pm, sir.

908
01:26:58,680 --> 01:26:59,704
Thank you.

909
01:27:00,248 --> 01:27:02,443
I think the doorman's
memory is off by an hour.

910
01:27:03,318 --> 01:27:05,513
Victor maintains a
record of my every activity.

911
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:09,387
And if he is saying I came home
at 1:30, then that's the truth.

912
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:11,984
Of course.

913
01:27:12,494 --> 01:27:15,827
Thank you. - No, not at all.
You are most welcome.

914
01:27:16,398 --> 01:27:18,593
If I can help you in any way...

915
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:21,692
please don't hesitate in
getting touch with me.

916
01:27:22,471 --> 01:27:27,704
As you can see here and on
this fake one and as you see...

917
01:27:27,743 --> 01:27:30,405
it is the less obvious point...

918
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:32,740
if it comes to faking a note.

919
01:27:34,616 --> 01:27:36,516
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

920
01:27:51,566 --> 01:27:52,658
Boom!

921
01:28:07,649 --> 01:28:08,843
There has been an explosion!

922
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:10,774
We have to get you
out right now, sir!

923
01:28:22,364 --> 01:28:24,355
Lock the vault immediately.

924
01:28:40,782 --> 01:28:42,409
No idea where it came from...

925
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,449
Shut up!

926
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:49,982
Let me make some calls and
find out what's going on.

927
01:29:07,642 --> 01:29:08,973
It's on the 5th floor.

928
01:29:09,478 --> 01:29:10,809
All people must leave the building.

929
01:29:10,879 --> 01:29:11,971
Come on go.

930
01:30:05,333 --> 01:30:06,664
Don't worry it's okay.

931
01:30:07,469 --> 01:30:09,960
Get in there! Get in there!

932
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:11,731
Go! Go!

933
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:18,637
Don't worry!

934
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:23,441
Hey! What are you doing?

935
01:30:44,039 --> 01:30:45,404
What's happening?

936
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:47,264
I'll check with the centre.

937
01:30:48,977 --> 01:30:50,444
Why are the gates being shut?

938
01:31:00,388 --> 01:31:01,446
Let's go.

939
01:31:01,489 --> 01:31:02,547
Okay.

940
01:31:47,268 --> 01:31:48,360
Open the gate.

941
01:32:01,683 --> 01:32:03,412
We are in the vault.
Get the hostages!

942
01:32:43,458 --> 01:32:45,619
Sam, it's too bright in here.

943
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:46,818
Do something, will you?

944
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:48,292
Copy that.

945
01:32:59,941 --> 01:33:01,806
Emergency lights activated.

946
01:33:05,847 --> 01:33:06,905
You don't understand!

947
01:33:06,981 --> 01:33:09,541
I am answerable to the
German government and its people.

948
01:33:09,784 --> 01:33:11,251
Please, I must stay.

949
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:12,377
Hello?

950
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:13,682
Good evening, Mr. Malik.

951
01:33:14,789 --> 01:33:15,847
Don?

952
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:17,281
It's Don!

953
01:33:18,293 --> 01:33:20,591
I'd like to speak with Roma, please.

954
01:33:20,695 --> 01:33:21,957
How do you know...

955
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:25,391
Oh my God!

956
01:33:26,468 --> 01:33:28,868
God won't come here, Mr. Malik.

957
01:33:29,504 --> 01:33:30,664
He is in the building.

958
01:33:31,673 --> 01:33:32,799
Let me talk to Roma.

959
01:33:32,841 --> 01:33:34,433
He wants to talk to you.

960
01:33:37,512 --> 01:33:38,604
Hello?

961
01:33:38,847 --> 01:33:41,509
Roma, Roma...

962
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:44,585
you aren't giving up, are you?

963
01:33:45,353 --> 01:33:48,811
People might think you still love me.

964
01:33:51,326 --> 01:33:52,384
What do you want?

965
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,960
I'd like to give you a last chance.

966
01:33:55,530 --> 01:33:58,260
I want you to drop
all charges against me.

967
01:33:58,299 --> 01:34:00,529
You've already seen one explosion.

968
01:34:00,602 --> 01:34:05,005
I can set off other
explosions around the building.

969
01:34:05,273 --> 01:34:10,438
And seeing you so close
to me is suffocating me.

970
01:34:10,745 --> 01:34:12,906
So everybody... move
back a little please!

971
01:34:13,348 --> 01:34:14,406
What is he saying?

972
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:15,710
If we don't move our men back...

973
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:17,547
he is going to
detonate another explosive.

974
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:21,352
He's bluffing!
- No, I am not.

975
01:34:21,956 --> 01:34:25,619
Roma, tell Commissioner
Mueller to take a look at...

976
01:34:26,294 --> 01:34:27,761
...the fire truck in front of him.

977
01:34:28,797 --> 01:34:30,355
In 30 seconds it'll blow up.

978
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:35,494
Damn it! Move all your men back,
we have only 30 seconds.

979
01:35:16,945 --> 01:35:18,537
Roma, Roma...
- What?

980
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:19,940
Hello...

981
01:35:20,281 --> 01:35:22,772
is it me you're looking for...

982
01:35:23,418 --> 01:35:25,978
What do you want?
- My wild cat...

983
01:35:26,988 --> 01:35:29,889
Anybody comes within 100
feet of this building and...

984
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:31,881
I'll set off more explosions.

985
01:35:33,995 --> 01:35:35,326
Understood?

986
01:35:35,897 --> 01:35:37,387
Yes.

987
01:35:38,266 --> 01:35:42,293
I'm watching all of you,
especially you...

988
01:35:42,437 --> 01:35:43,699
so no tricks please.

989
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:46,673
And get this damn
helicopter to buzz off!

990
01:35:46,975 --> 01:35:49,671
It's spoiling the mood, sweetheart.

991
01:35:50,945 --> 01:35:52,242
Don!

992
01:35:53,681 --> 01:35:54,773
Damn it!

993
01:36:06,561 --> 01:36:09,655
The cops are going to be busy
deciding their next strategy.

994
01:36:11,966 --> 01:36:13,593
Are all our men in position?

995
01:36:13,801 --> 01:36:14,859
Yes.

996
01:36:15,303 --> 01:36:16,429
And the bombs?

997
01:36:16,638 --> 01:36:19,004
Exactly where you wanted them.

998
01:36:19,707 --> 01:36:20,765
Very good.

999
01:36:20,975 --> 01:36:22,272
Let's get to work.

1000
01:37:10,959 --> 01:37:13,757
The gas will be effective in
the chamber for 3 minutes.

1001
01:37:15,229 --> 01:37:16,423
I leave the rest to you.

1002
01:38:36,511 --> 01:38:37,773
Alarm activated.

1003
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:42,841
Come on!

1004
01:38:43,418 --> 01:38:44,510
Get out of there.

1005
01:38:51,325 --> 01:38:53,020
- That was close!
- Yeah!

1006
01:38:53,995 --> 01:38:57,692
Where are the plates?
- You think I'd leave without them?

1007
01:38:58,499 --> 01:38:59,557
All good.

1008
01:38:59,634 --> 01:39:00,726
Pass me the bag please.

1009
01:39:04,405 --> 01:39:05,497
Thank you.

1010
01:39:12,513 --> 01:39:13,775
Sam?
- Yes?

1011
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:16,041
Time to go!

1012
01:39:16,384 --> 01:39:17,476
Got it.

1013
01:39:29,764 --> 01:39:33,029
I told you I will never
forget what you did to me.

1014
01:39:34,902 --> 01:39:36,392
Even so you trusted me.

1015
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:40,498
Plates, please...

1016
01:39:47,815 --> 01:39:48,907
bag.

1017
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:54,381
Not very smart, are you?

1018
01:40:00,928 --> 01:40:03,795
You wanted to leave
me behind to die, huh?

1019
01:40:04,499 --> 01:40:05,761
Death will come, Don.

1020
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:08,434
Not for me...

1021
01:40:09,737 --> 01:40:10,863
but you!

1022
01:40:13,307 --> 01:40:18,802
Jabbar, if you kill me how
do you plan on escaping?

1023
01:40:20,581 --> 01:40:21,946
What do you mean?
- I mean...

1024
01:40:22,717 --> 01:40:25,345
there is neither a
service exit in the basement...

1025
01:40:25,419 --> 01:40:28,320
nor is Ayesha
waiting in a police van.

1026
01:40:28,523 --> 01:40:29,615
You see...

1027
01:40:30,291 --> 01:40:33,454
I didn't have an
escape plan for you at all.

1028
01:40:38,966 --> 01:40:40,058
Jabbar!

1029
01:40:40,568 --> 01:40:41,660
That's a lie!

1030
01:40:41,736 --> 01:40:44,728
How did he plan on getting away
if he didn't have an escape plan?

1031
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:46,664
Vardhaan...

1032
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:50,002
perhaps you weren't paying attention.

1033
01:40:52,313 --> 01:40:56,272
I didn't have an
escape plan for 'you'.

1034
01:40:58,819 --> 01:41:00,946
You think you can get away from us?

1035
01:41:02,023 --> 01:41:04,491
Remember, Sameer said
he couldn't control...

1036
01:41:04,559 --> 01:41:06,686
...the electric supply in the vault?

1037
01:41:09,463 --> 01:41:10,725
He was lying.

1038
01:41:13,434 --> 01:41:14,526
Hey!

1039
01:41:14,802 --> 01:41:16,565
What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1040
01:41:20,808 --> 01:41:22,298
Karl? Karl?

1041
01:41:22,743 --> 01:41:23,801
What's going on?

1042
01:41:35,423 --> 01:41:36,720
Shocking behaviour, dude!

1043
01:41:46,601 --> 01:41:48,728
Find Don! Go!

1044
01:41:51,339 --> 01:41:52,431
Perfect timing, Sam.

1045
01:41:52,607 --> 01:41:53,733
Thanks.

1046
01:41:54,342 --> 01:41:56,401
See you outside. Switching off.

1047
01:42:08,022 --> 01:42:09,580
Good day.
- Good day.

1048
01:42:09,991 --> 01:42:11,515
Could you deliver this urgently.

1049
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,012
Hello officer...

1050
01:44:21,956 --> 01:44:23,514
listen to me very carefully.

1051
01:44:47,648 --> 01:44:49,946
So, ready to go.

1052
01:44:51,652 --> 01:44:52,744
Yeah...

1053
01:44:53,854 --> 01:44:54,946
ready.

1054
01:44:58,426 --> 01:44:59,518
Thanks.

1055
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:03,388
Drop the gun.

1056
01:45:04,732 --> 01:45:06,324
I said drop the gun!

1057
01:45:08,469 --> 01:45:09,561
Drop the gun.

1058
01:45:15,876 --> 01:45:17,002
Hands on your head!

1059
01:45:26,921 --> 01:45:28,445
You are under arrest, Don!

1060
01:45:29,023 --> 01:45:30,354
You got me.

1061
01:45:30,691 --> 01:45:31,749
I did.

1062
01:45:33,494 --> 01:45:34,518
Cuffs.

1063
01:45:36,597 --> 01:45:37,689
Hands behind you.

1064
01:45:40,534 --> 01:45:43,833
Ooh... kinky!

1065
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:47,732
Glad you like it.

1066
01:45:48,776 --> 01:45:49,868
Because they aren't coming off!

1067
01:45:53,881 --> 01:45:54,939
It's over, Don.

1068
01:45:57,318 --> 01:45:58,751
Where are your partners?

1069
01:45:59,453 --> 01:46:02,217
You may search my pockets.

1070
01:46:03,324 --> 01:46:04,450
Where are they?

1071
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:07,953
They aren't my partners...
any more, Mr. Malik.

1072
01:46:08,562 --> 01:46:09,654
What do you mean?

1073
01:46:09,697 --> 01:46:10,789
I mean...

1074
01:46:11,232 --> 01:46:15,669
Vardhaan controls them now, not me.

1075
01:46:18,672 --> 01:46:20,003
Vardhaan is in the building?

1076
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:22,843
Vardhaan, Abdul Jabbar and his goons.

1077
01:46:24,378 --> 01:46:26,403
They are a dangerous bunch...

1078
01:46:27,014 --> 01:46:28,276
be careful.

1079
01:46:30,684 --> 01:46:31,776
Come on.

1080
01:46:34,922 --> 01:46:37,356
So you let your
heart overcome your mind.

1081
01:46:37,691 --> 01:46:38,749
Very sad.

1082
01:46:40,361 --> 01:46:41,919
It was a momentary
lapse of judgment but...

1083
01:46:43,797 --> 01:46:44,821
I realised I'm not like you.

1084
01:46:44,899 --> 01:46:47,197
You definitely are not!

1085
01:46:47,935 --> 01:46:50,199
I have a long life ahead of me...

1086
01:46:50,571 --> 01:46:52,596
whereas you and Yana
don't have a future.

1087
01:46:52,940 --> 01:46:55,500
Stop it! Take him away!

1088
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:08,685
I'd like to speak to
the officer-in-charger.

1089
01:47:10,324 --> 01:47:11,416
Vardhaan...

1090
01:47:11,926 --> 01:47:13,985
It's coming from
inside the building, sir.

1091
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:15,987
Give it to me.

1092
01:47:16,964 --> 01:47:18,397
Detective Malik here.

1093
01:47:18,866 --> 01:47:19,958
Hello Malik?

1094
01:47:21,702 --> 01:47:22,794
Vardhaan.

1095
01:47:22,836 --> 01:47:24,963
You better surrender, Vardhaan.

1096
01:47:25,739 --> 01:47:26,763
Why?

1097
01:47:27,408 --> 01:47:29,706
I have 25 of DZB's
staff as hostages and...

1098
01:47:29,743 --> 01:47:33,804
you know I won't
hesitate in killing them.

1099
01:47:34,315 --> 01:47:37,978
You are already in a mess,
don't try anything stupid.

1100
01:47:38,252 --> 01:47:39,514
No, no...

1101
01:47:39,587 --> 01:47:42,556
You'll be stupid to ignore my words.

1102
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:46,657
In two hours I need a helicopter
that will take us to the airport.

1103
01:47:46,961 --> 01:47:48,895
And I need a plane waiting for us.

1104
01:47:49,897 --> 01:47:54,334
When we reach our destination,
I will set the hostages free.

1105
01:47:54,401 --> 01:47:55,527
Is that clear, Malik?

1106
01:47:55,636 --> 01:47:57,900
That's not possible.

1107
01:47:58,906 --> 01:48:00,203
Really?

1108
01:48:02,276 --> 01:48:03,368
Jabbar!

1109
01:48:09,249 --> 01:48:10,341
Vardhaan!

1110
01:48:12,553 --> 01:48:13,645
You hear that?

1111
01:48:13,921 --> 01:48:15,912
If firing into air
can have that effect...

1112
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:20,256
Imagine if I had to
shoot one of them.

1113
01:48:21,495 --> 01:48:22,587
Two hours.

1114
01:48:29,703 --> 01:48:32,536
Do you know how Don
exited the building?

1115
01:48:33,507 --> 01:48:34,804
No, really sorry.

1116
01:48:34,875 --> 01:48:37,969
I was in touch with him
till he got out of the vault.

1117
01:48:44,918 --> 01:48:46,442
What was he doing in the vault?

1118
01:48:49,590 --> 01:48:51,717
So Sameer confessed everything?

1119
01:48:51,759 --> 01:48:53,488
Answer me...

1120
01:48:53,894 --> 01:48:54,986
where are the plates?

1121
01:48:55,863 --> 01:48:57,262
Vardhaan has the plates.

1122
01:48:57,831 --> 01:48:59,321
How did you get out of the building?

1123
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:06,733
Answer my question, Don!

1124
01:49:07,041 --> 01:49:08,531
Why should I tell you?

1125
01:49:09,043 --> 01:49:12,809
The hostages could
die because of you.

1126
01:49:13,881 --> 01:49:16,372
I regret this is happening,
Mr. Malik.

1127
01:49:17,451 --> 01:49:19,043
But if you want my help...

1128
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:21,551
then I want something in return too.

1129
01:49:22,756 --> 01:49:25,486
You are in no position to negotiate.

1130
01:49:25,959 --> 01:49:27,392
Well in that case...

1131
01:49:28,495 --> 01:49:30,486
I'd like to talk to Mr. Diwan.

1132
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:34,658
Why?

1133
01:49:35,669 --> 01:49:40,038
I think he will empathise with me.

1134
01:49:45,512 --> 01:49:46,501
It's quite simple.

1135
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:49,949
If I go to prison, so
do you and Fabian Kohl.

1136
01:49:50,017 --> 01:49:51,314
Look you can't...

1137
01:49:54,955 --> 01:49:56,252
please look...

1138
01:49:56,290 --> 01:49:59,316
Look we had a deal. I gave
you everything you asked for!

1139
01:50:00,327 --> 01:50:01,988
Trust me, this is my last request.

1140
01:50:03,297 --> 01:50:04,355
Promise.

1141
01:50:11,972 --> 01:50:13,303
He will help us.

1142
01:50:14,374 --> 01:50:17,969
Mr. Diwan has promised me
immunity here in Germany.

1143
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:21,975
For some reason, I trust him.

1144
01:50:23,817 --> 01:50:29,722
In return, I'll help diffuse
the bombs and free the hostages.

1145
01:50:30,424 --> 01:50:31,755
What about the plates?

1146
01:50:31,959 --> 01:50:33,290
Don't worry.

1147
01:50:33,727 --> 01:50:34,785
You'll get the plates back.

1148
01:50:35,529 --> 01:50:36,962
Roma...

1149
01:50:38,499 --> 01:50:39,591
What?

1150
01:50:39,867 --> 01:50:41,562
I want you to believe that..

1151
01:50:41,802 --> 01:50:45,294
...this change of heart isn't an
act and as a show of good faith..

1152
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:47,869
I'm ready to deliver
the discs to you...

1153
01:50:48,408 --> 01:50:56,440
which will put an end to the
drug trade in Europe and Asia.

1154
01:50:57,985 --> 01:50:59,316
Really?

1155
01:51:04,792 --> 01:51:06,350
Roma, strange isn't it?

1156
01:51:06,693 --> 01:51:09,890
Once again life has
brought us together.

1157
01:51:10,531 --> 01:51:12,556
You and I can never be together.

1158
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:14,894
You never know.

1159
01:51:17,971 --> 01:51:19,768
Perhaps someday you
will realise that...

1160
01:51:19,807 --> 01:51:22,799
I'm no longer the same
Don that you despise.

1161
01:51:24,044 --> 01:51:27,980
Though a dog may straighten
its tail, it is still a dog.

1162
01:51:30,450 --> 01:51:33,783
No wonder I can't let
go of you, my wild cat.

1163
01:51:34,855 --> 01:51:36,948
What? Are you going to shoot me?

1164
01:51:38,792 --> 01:51:40,054
Don't tempt me.

1165
01:51:44,464 --> 01:51:45,522
Let's go.

1166
01:51:47,668 --> 01:51:48,828
Roma, please...

1167
01:51:49,269 --> 01:51:50,463
do you really need to do this?

1168
01:51:50,504 --> 01:51:51,937
Yes, I do!
- Why?

1169
01:51:52,706 --> 01:51:54,469
The S.E. K unit can do the job...

1170
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:55,667
Will you just relax?

1171
01:51:56,810 --> 01:51:59,370
Stay with Mr. Malik, got it?

1172
01:52:01,882 --> 01:52:04,248
If anything happens to her, I will...

1173
01:52:05,552 --> 01:52:06,678
You will...

1174
01:52:07,254 --> 01:52:08,312
what?

1175
01:52:14,928 --> 01:52:17,624
Your team is very
concerned about each other.

1176
01:52:19,399 --> 01:52:20,559
Sweet!

1177
01:52:27,274 --> 01:52:29,265
Gentlemen... enjoy the swim.

1178
01:52:38,752 --> 01:52:39,946
Where's Don?

1179
01:52:40,354 --> 01:52:41,446
Forget him!

1180
01:52:41,955 --> 01:52:44,753
If he wants to live,
he won't come back.

1181
01:52:48,762 --> 01:52:50,252
Okay, which way now?

1182
01:52:51,398 --> 01:52:52,456
Follow me.

1183
01:53:00,774 --> 01:53:03,709
So, what's the deal
between you and... Arjun?

1184
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:07,747
It doesn't concern you.

1185
01:53:08,315 --> 01:53:11,580
Thought we'd catch up. Is that wrong?

1186
01:53:11,685 --> 01:53:15,519
You? Besides yourself, you are
incapable of thinking about anything.

1187
01:53:16,456 --> 01:53:17,514
And you.

1188
01:53:29,536 --> 01:53:31,299
You guys take cover behind the door.

1189
01:53:34,274 --> 01:53:35,901
Herman, go.

1190
01:53:55,963 --> 01:53:57,260
Roma.

1191
01:53:58,665 --> 01:53:59,757
What?

1192
01:54:01,368 --> 01:54:04,667
When I said, I was ready to
give the police the disc...

1193
01:54:05,839 --> 01:54:06,965
how did you feel?

1194
01:54:14,548 --> 01:54:17,517
Your words no longer
have an effect on me.

1195
01:54:18,018 --> 01:54:19,280
I know...

1196
01:54:19,786 --> 01:54:21,913
but still you were surprised.

1197
01:54:23,757 --> 01:54:27,420
Roma, the fact is
I'm tired of my life.

1198
01:54:28,762 --> 01:54:31,560
Now I loathe people
like Vardhaan and Coogan.

1199
01:54:33,367 --> 01:54:35,767
I want to be free
from them and the law.

1200
01:54:35,836 --> 01:54:39,328
I want to be a free man.

1201
01:54:43,276 --> 01:54:44,334
Please...

1202
01:54:46,747 --> 01:54:47,839
forgive me.

1203
01:54:49,583 --> 01:54:50,811
Come on, we are clear.

1204
01:55:12,406 --> 01:55:13,464
Wait Roma.

1205
01:55:14,574 --> 01:55:15,836
There are security cameras outside.

1206
01:55:16,009 --> 01:55:18,500
Jabbar's goons can monitor
everything in the surveillance room.

1207
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:21,345
This was your brilliant plan?

1208
01:55:22,849 --> 01:55:24,817
I had planted one bomb
in the there so that...

1209
01:55:24,885 --> 01:55:28,321
we could destroy all
evidence as we escape.

1210
01:55:45,839 --> 01:55:46,863
Karl!

1211
01:55:46,973 --> 01:55:48,304
Check where the blast happened.

1212
01:55:48,542 --> 01:55:49,770
All positions... report in.

1213
01:55:50,343 --> 01:55:53,437
Position 1, all clear.
Position 2, all clear.

1214
01:55:54,815 --> 01:55:56,339
Position 3 come in...

1215
01:55:57,784 --> 01:55:58,876
Position 3?

1216
01:56:01,855 --> 01:56:02,981
Ladies first.

1217
01:56:06,927 --> 01:56:08,258
Position 3?

1218
01:56:10,897 --> 01:56:12,865
No reply from the
surveillance room, Jabbar.

1219
01:56:16,903 --> 01:56:17,961
Don!

1220
01:56:19,706 --> 01:56:20,798
Karl...

1221
01:56:21,708 --> 01:56:22,834
bring me his head.

1222
01:56:23,844 --> 01:56:24,902
Ulrich! Sven!

1223
01:56:39,759 --> 01:56:41,351
Sven and Ulrich are dead.

1224
01:59:07,374 --> 01:59:08,432
You're welcome.

1225
01:59:11,611 --> 01:59:12,805
You are shot.

1226
01:59:13,513 --> 01:59:14,639
Merely grazed me.

1227
01:59:15,582 --> 01:59:17,447
Sorry.
- You okay?

1228
01:59:18,051 --> 01:59:19,484
We're good.

1229
01:59:20,854 --> 01:59:22,446
Stay down. I'm going
to check on the others.

1230
01:59:24,291 --> 01:59:25,986
May I ask you something?

1231
01:59:26,459 --> 01:59:27,585
Yeah.

1232
01:59:28,561 --> 01:59:30,961
What's the deal
between you and Arjun?

1233
01:59:32,866 --> 01:59:34,060
He likes you.

1234
01:59:37,437 --> 01:59:40,406
It's not difficult to
understand why he likes you.

1235
01:59:41,875 --> 01:59:43,001
And you...

1236
01:59:43,643 --> 01:59:44,735
Do you like him?

1237
01:59:47,314 --> 01:59:49,407
I don't need to answer anything.

1238
01:59:50,817 --> 01:59:52,250
You know what I think?

1239
01:59:53,653 --> 01:59:54,881
You don't like him...

1240
01:59:56,456 --> 01:59:58,356
because you still love me.

1241
01:59:59,826 --> 02:00:01,851
I don't love you.

1242
02:00:02,696 --> 02:00:03,754
Just checking!

1243
02:00:04,964 --> 02:00:06,022
Herman's dead.

1244
02:00:06,533 --> 02:00:07,795
And the bomb is still armed.

1245
02:00:08,335 --> 02:00:09,495
Karl, can you hear me?

1246
02:00:10,737 --> 02:00:11,829
Karl, come in...

1247
02:00:12,839 --> 02:00:14,704
Ulrich... come in... Damn it!

1248
02:00:16,543 --> 02:00:17,703
Something is wrong.

1249
02:00:17,911 --> 02:00:19,003
Jabbar...

1250
02:00:19,512 --> 02:00:21,309
detonate the bombs.

1251
02:00:21,748 --> 02:00:24,546
Let them know how it
feels to mess with us!

1252
02:00:36,062 --> 02:00:37,461
Try the other one!

1253
02:00:49,008 --> 02:00:50,600
It's not working...

1254
02:00:51,411 --> 02:00:53,242
Jabbar...

1255
02:01:00,286 --> 02:01:01,844
Let her go, please!

1256
02:01:02,255 --> 02:01:03,745
Please don't kill her!

1257
02:01:07,293 --> 02:01:11,923
Malik, if the helicopter
isn't here in five minutes...

1258
02:01:11,998 --> 02:01:13,761
this poor woman will lose her life.

1259
02:01:13,900 --> 02:01:15,299
Vardhaan...

1260
02:01:15,368 --> 02:01:18,303
2 hours aren't up yet.
20 minutes to go.

1261
02:01:18,371 --> 02:01:19,736
You're lying, Malik.

1262
02:01:20,306 --> 02:01:22,740
When I throw this woman's
body out of the window...

1263
02:01:22,876 --> 02:01:26,277
you'll know we weren't lying.

1264
02:01:27,647 --> 02:01:28,909
Jabbar, don't!

1265
02:01:29,582 --> 02:01:31,379
The police didn't betray you, I did.

1266
02:01:32,285 --> 02:01:33,479
Let the woman go.

1267
02:01:33,987 --> 02:01:35,420
I'm coming there.

1268
02:01:36,423 --> 02:01:40,018
Vardhaan, the helicopter
has left the airbase.

1269
02:01:40,727 --> 02:01:42,388
It will be here in ten minutes.

1270
02:01:43,496 --> 02:01:47,956
Trust me! If you shoot,
I won't be able to help you.

1271
02:01:50,003 --> 02:01:51,698
Ten minutes, Malik!

1272
02:01:52,472 --> 02:01:53,564
Don...

1273
02:01:54,674 --> 02:01:57,837
come here right now!

1274
02:02:02,782 --> 02:02:03,840
Just a second.

1275
02:02:04,784 --> 02:02:06,012
Philip needs medical help.

1276
02:02:06,653 --> 02:02:07,847
I think you should stay with him.

1277
02:02:08,321 --> 02:02:09,447
I'm going with Don, okay?

1278
02:02:09,689 --> 02:02:10,747
Good luck.

1279
02:02:10,824 --> 02:02:11,916
Thanks.

1280
02:02:12,492 --> 02:02:13,550
Roma, what are you doing?

1281
02:02:13,726 --> 02:02:14,852
It's not safe for you.

1282
02:02:15,328 --> 02:02:17,353
That woman needs me.

1283
02:02:17,497 --> 02:02:18,521
But it's too dangerous.

1284
02:02:18,698 --> 02:02:20,029
Vardhaan and Jabbar can't be trusted.

1285
02:02:20,433 --> 02:02:22,924
It's my duty to get
those hostages out.

1286
02:02:23,336 --> 02:02:25,896
Try to understand, Roma!

1287
02:02:26,873 --> 02:02:28,272
If something were to happen to you...

1288
02:02:33,746 --> 02:02:35,441
I'm coming with you.

1289
02:02:36,583 --> 02:02:37,811
That's it.

1290
02:02:38,418 --> 02:02:39,544
Let's go.

1291
02:02:49,262 --> 02:02:50,957
Well, well, well!

1292
02:02:51,598 --> 02:02:52,997
What a happy reunion!

1293
02:02:54,567 --> 02:02:55,693
Hello Roma.

1294
02:02:56,402 --> 02:02:58,768
Your weapons on the floor.

1295
02:02:59,405 --> 02:03:01,430
I mean really!
Do I need to spell it out?

1296
02:03:08,882 --> 02:03:11,248
Please remove
your bullet proof vest.

1297
02:03:16,022 --> 02:03:19,583
Vardhaan, the police is giving
you everything you asked for.

1298
02:03:20,293 --> 02:03:22,784
In return, at least let the women go.

1299
02:03:22,829 --> 02:03:24,023
No, not a chance.

1300
02:03:25,465 --> 02:03:27,592
I've realised that women are...

1301
02:03:29,736 --> 02:03:31,294
...more useful in these situations.

1302
02:03:32,338 --> 02:03:34,499
If we must let someone go...

1303
02:03:36,576 --> 02:03:37,736
let it be Don.

1304
02:03:37,977 --> 02:03:39,808
Sorry.
- Don't be!

1305
02:03:41,548 --> 02:03:44,881
I want to kill Don
and so does Jabbar.

1306
02:03:45,418 --> 02:03:48,854
And I'm sure you won't regret
if he is killed. Right?

1307
02:03:50,924 --> 02:03:52,221
Right?

1308
02:03:55,428 --> 02:03:56,520
Give her the gun.

1309
02:04:10,643 --> 02:04:11,701
Good.

1310
02:04:13,513 --> 02:04:14,673
Now...

1311
02:04:16,849 --> 02:04:17,975
kill him.

1312
02:04:29,028 --> 02:04:30,393
Amazing!

1313
02:04:31,698 --> 02:04:33,859
Now I've seen it all.

1314
02:04:35,935 --> 02:04:37,800
You seem to have cast
a spell on her, Don.

1315
02:04:39,339 --> 02:04:40,431
Anyway.

1316
02:04:42,508 --> 02:04:43,770
Let's try again.

1317
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:45,436
Let's try again.

1318
02:04:45,778 --> 02:04:46,836
Jabbar!

1319
02:04:47,714 --> 02:04:50,808
If she doesn't shoot Don
by the time I count three...

1320
02:04:53,586 --> 02:04:54,644
shoot her!

1321
02:05:00,293 --> 02:05:01,453
One...

1322
02:05:03,663 --> 02:05:04,789
Pull the trigger, Roma.

1323
02:05:05,298 --> 02:05:06,424
Two...

1324
02:05:07,333 --> 02:05:08,493
Shoot me, Roma!

1325
02:05:12,538 --> 02:05:14,233
Three!
- Do it!

1326
02:05:42,735 --> 02:05:44,635
So, both of you were under a spell.

1327
02:05:50,843 --> 02:05:52,276
You're next, Don.

1328
02:05:53,579 --> 02:05:55,570
Vardhaan, you seem
to forget something.

1329
02:05:55,915 --> 02:05:57,212
What's that?

1330
02:05:57,583 --> 02:06:00,416
Before Don's enemy can
make his first move...

1331
02:06:01,688 --> 02:06:03,986
Don has made his next move!

1332
02:07:38,251 --> 02:07:39,411
Is everybody okay?

1333
02:07:39,919 --> 02:07:41,546
No. Not yet.

1334
02:07:41,721 --> 02:07:43,746
Stay right there! Please!

1335
02:07:47,326 --> 02:07:48,554
Mr. Malik?

1336
02:07:50,496 --> 02:07:51,622
Malik here.

1337
02:07:51,798 --> 02:07:54,790
Mr. Malik, Jabbar is dead.

1338
02:07:54,934 --> 02:07:58,700
And you won't have any issue in
taking Vardhaan back to prison.

1339
02:08:00,339 --> 02:08:02,432
The plates and hostages are with me.

1340
02:08:03,442 --> 02:08:04,568
So now...

1341
02:08:04,877 --> 02:08:08,369
I hope you have the papers
for my immunity.

1342
02:08:11,217 --> 02:08:12,411
We have the papers.

1343
02:08:12,552 --> 02:08:13,849
Very good, Mr. Malik.

1344
02:08:14,787 --> 02:08:16,254
Send them in...

1345
02:08:18,791 --> 02:08:19,985
with Sameer!

1346
02:08:20,827 --> 02:08:21,919
Sameer?

1347
02:08:22,395 --> 02:08:26,764
I want to see that
traitor one last time.

1348
02:08:53,426 --> 02:08:54,552
She's alive.

1349
02:08:56,028 --> 02:08:57,325
Bring the file here.

1350
02:09:08,441 --> 02:09:09,999
Let him go! Now!

1351
02:09:11,577 --> 02:09:14,011
You better find a safe hiding place.

1352
02:09:14,780 --> 02:09:16,407
Because the day I find you...

1353
02:09:17,283 --> 02:09:18,580
you'll be dead!

1354
02:09:19,352 --> 02:09:21,650
You know where I live,
drop in any time.

1355
02:09:23,823 --> 02:09:24,949
Of course!

1356
02:09:25,024 --> 02:09:26,548
I know where you live.

1357
02:09:26,926 --> 02:09:28,791
Drop the weapon. Right now!

1358
02:09:52,752 --> 02:09:53,980
What happened to Roma?

1359
02:10:00,893 --> 02:10:02,292
Yours I believe...

1360
02:10:04,463 --> 02:10:05,589
do take care of her.

1361
02:10:07,900 --> 02:10:08,958
Here! Hurry!

1362
02:10:17,977 --> 02:10:19,308
Gentlemen...

1363
02:10:20,379 --> 02:10:22,040
is there anything
else I can do for you?

1364
02:10:22,949 --> 02:10:24,507
Where is the disc?

1365
02:10:24,951 --> 02:10:26,646
In the bag with the plates.

1366
02:10:27,486 --> 02:10:30,717
Can I leave now?

1367
02:10:30,990 --> 02:10:33,481
Once I check the disc...

1368
02:10:33,559 --> 02:10:34,617
Of course.

1369
02:10:35,661 --> 02:10:39,825
And how long will that take?

1370
02:10:42,935 --> 02:10:43,993
Take him away!

1371
02:10:45,571 --> 02:10:46,697
Good night, everyone.

1372
02:10:50,810 --> 02:10:51,902
Thank you.

1373
02:11:34,453 --> 02:11:35,511
Check this out!

1374
02:11:39,725 --> 02:11:41,454
What about these plates, Mr. Diwan?

1375
02:11:41,527 --> 02:11:42,585
I'll take them.

1376
02:11:43,763 --> 02:11:45,993
They need to be checked for damages.

1377
02:11:53,706 --> 02:11:55,503
Is it good?
- Good?

1378
02:11:55,975 --> 02:11:57,465
It's priceless, Mr. Malik.

1379
02:11:59,445 --> 02:12:01,310
You want Mr. Kohl
to become president...

1380
02:12:01,614 --> 02:12:02,911
he will be the president.

1381
02:12:03,416 --> 02:12:05,008
That's my responsibility.

1382
02:12:05,351 --> 02:12:06,409
Oh my God!

1383
02:12:25,037 --> 02:12:26,766
Remember I said...

1384
02:12:27,006 --> 02:12:32,945
'Don's enemies should always
remember that Don never forgets.'

1385
02:12:37,983 --> 02:12:39,883
The people who
wanted to get rid of me..

1386
02:12:39,952 --> 02:12:41,647
...are themselves in the docks now.

1387
02:12:42,521 --> 02:12:44,512
Jimmy Coogan, you are under arrest.

1388
02:12:45,357 --> 02:12:49,794
Jimmy Coogan and all his ilk.

1389
02:12:52,698 --> 02:12:57,533
The police had to accept that
it was because of my help...

1390
02:12:57,703 --> 02:12:59,898
...that Fabian Kohl was exposed.

1391
02:13:02,341 --> 02:13:05,936
Vardhaan got back to
where he belonged.

1392
02:13:10,583 --> 02:13:14,917
Now to take care of one last thing.

1393
02:13:19,825 --> 02:13:21,690
Yes?
- Package for Mr. Ali?

1394
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:22,818
Yes, that's me.

1395
02:13:22,895 --> 02:13:24,362
Please sign here, sir.

1396
02:13:26,432 --> 02:13:27,490
Here you go.

1397
02:13:29,535 --> 02:13:30,695
- Thanks, - Bye.

1398
02:13:45,718 --> 02:13:47,379
Hello?
- Don.

1399
02:13:48,754 --> 02:13:50,813
I sent you a present.

1400
02:13:53,325 --> 02:13:54,656
I hope you like it.

1401
02:14:46,946 --> 02:14:48,675
I missed you sweetheart.

1402
02:14:56,288 --> 02:14:57,448
Where is he?

1403
02:14:58,490 --> 02:14:59,650
He's right here.

1404
02:15:07,333 --> 02:15:11,394
When I get out of the DZB,
hand me over to the police.

1405
02:15:12,638 --> 02:15:13,730
Sorry?

1406
02:15:14,807 --> 02:15:15,865
Don't worry.

1407
02:15:16,475 --> 02:15:17,635
It's part of the plan.

1408
02:15:18,611 --> 02:15:21,603
This disc has all the
information and details.

1409
02:15:24,450 --> 02:15:27,283
Here's what I want you to do with it.

1410
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:35,618
Check this out.

1411
02:15:41,634 --> 02:15:43,431
The perfect crime!

1412
02:15:46,038 --> 02:15:47,437
Plates please...

1413
02:16:22,808 --> 02:16:23,866
- Thanks.
- Bye.

1414
02:16:25,978 --> 02:16:29,539
Everybody thinks the real
plates were destroyed in the blast.

1415
02:16:30,015 --> 02:16:33,246
But here they are with me.

1416
02:16:58,310 --> 02:16:59,402
Now what?

1417
02:17:00,279 --> 02:17:03,442
My enemies are
either dead or in prison.

1418
02:17:03,749 --> 02:17:06,877
And the police have nothing on me.

1419
02:17:06,952 --> 02:17:08,249
So now...

1420
02:17:08,754 --> 02:17:10,915
Now... I am a free man!

1421
02:17:13,826 --> 02:17:14,918
What about Roma?

1422
02:17:16,562 --> 02:17:18,553
Why did you have to save her life?

1423
02:17:21,633 --> 02:17:23,498
Roma is like a bad habit.

1424
02:17:24,336 --> 02:17:25,963
And it's not easy to give up a habit.

1425
02:17:28,607 --> 02:17:29,904
Forget about her sweetheart.

1426
02:17:30,709 --> 02:17:33,837
Imagine how rich we're going to be!

1427
02:17:33,912 --> 02:17:34,970
Really!

1428
02:17:35,481 --> 02:17:37,813
I still can't believe
you got out alive.

1429
02:17:41,387 --> 02:17:43,378
Remember this...

1430
02:17:44,723 --> 02:17:46,623
It's not just difficult
to catch Don...

1431
02:18:09,782 --> 02:18:16,711
"No one knows...
What is this restlessness?."

1432
02:18:16,789 --> 02:18:19,952
"There's pain in my heart."

1433
02:18:20,426 --> 02:18:23,827
"Who is causing it?."

1434
02:18:23,896 --> 02:18:30,893
"The one I am looking for...
cannot escape me."

1435
02:18:30,969 --> 02:18:38,637
"Somewhere...
someday I will find him."

1436
02:18:40,879 --> 02:18:45,009
"My enemy."

1437
02:19:10,409 --> 02:19:16,370
"It's not easy to find me."

1438
02:19:17,416 --> 02:19:22,786
"Whether you search
on land or the sky."

1439
02:19:24,623 --> 02:19:29,925
"I am here and I am there."

1440
02:19:31,763 --> 02:19:36,962
"You will never find my clue."

1441
02:19:38,770 --> 02:19:42,729
"Anyone who's looking for me."

1442
02:19:43,542 --> 02:19:45,806
"Won't find a clue."

1443
02:19:45,878 --> 02:19:53,250
"Their desires will...
remain unfulfilled."

1444
02:19:53,318 --> 02:19:58,449
"My enemies should know that."

1445
02:20:21,747 --> 02:20:28,414
"What's that fire in your eyes?."

1446
02:20:28,854 --> 02:20:35,657
"Take my advice,
don't ever let it douse."

1447
02:20:35,994 --> 02:20:42,866
"You look so charming
when you are angry."

1448
02:20:43,335 --> 02:20:46,335
"Stay angry as long as you can."

1449
02:20:53,679 --> 02:21:00,676
"Someday you will... face my anger."

1450
02:21:00,719 --> 02:21:07,625
"One day you will know...
what's in my heart."

1451
02:21:07,726 --> 02:21:11,856

1452
02:21:12,331 --> 02:21:14,925
"When that day arrives."

1453
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:22,406
"Those desires will...
remain unfulfilled."

1454
02:21:22,474 --> 02:21:25,474
"My enemies should know this."
