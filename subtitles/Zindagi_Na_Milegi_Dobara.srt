1
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:43,670
Will you marry me?

2
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,228
Kabir... please.

3
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:46,705
Okay.

4
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,236
Will you marry me, please?

5
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:51,703
Why are you doing this?

6
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,345
Because sooner or later we will.

7
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,980
We love each other.

8
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,982
Our families seem to tolerate each other.

9
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,989
I'm an architect and
you're an interior designer.

10
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:05,848
We're perfect.

11
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,220
What do you say?

12
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:12,788
Are you sure?

13
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,592
Natasha, please make it quick...

14
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:16,396
my knee is hurting.

15
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,472
Yes!

16
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:42,053
It seems like only yesterday
that Natasha came into this world.

17
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,826
And today she's getting engaged.

18
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,423
Kabir, I'm not losing a daughter.

19
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,025
I'm gaining a son.

20
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:51,831
You're so filmy, dad.

21
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:57,266
Harryji

22
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,744
Two years ago you commissioned me
to build your hotel.

23
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:06,446
Who would've imagined that
one day we'll be a big family.

24
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,980
On behalf of my family,
I welcome you all.

25
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:11,287
Thank you so much.

26
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,326
Did you ever know that you're my hero

27
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,789
You're everything I wish I could be

28
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:24,264
I can fly like an eagle

29
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:29,799
Cause you're the wind beneath my wings

30
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:36,980
You're the wind beneath my wings

31
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,847
- That was lovely.

32
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,229
Hello everyone.

33
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,389
I am lmran.

34
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,688
Kabir and I have been friends
since school.

35
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,127
The three Musketeers!

36
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,301
That's right, it was the name
uncle had given the three of us.

37
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,537
The three Musketeers.

38
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,608
Unfortunately, the third musketeer...

39
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,803
Arjun is not with us anymore.

40
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,503
Don't worry, he's alive.
He just isn't here right now.

41
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:11,707
Anyway, Natasha...

42
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,613
Kabir is one of the nicest guys ever.

43
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,223
So, if you ever smash his BMW,
don't worry.

44
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,549
Good excuse to get a new car.

45
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,463
He's also very intelligent.

46
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,957
So leave the kid's homework to him.

47
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,769
You're a true friend, thanks.

48
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,736
You're welcome, bro.

49
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,569
He's very large hearted.

50
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,075
So, don't think twice...

51
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,702
just buy those diamonds.

52
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,377
Basically Natasha...

53
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,010
Kabir is a solid guy.

54
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,422
Put your hand in his and
walk with him.

55
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,149
Because no matter what...

56
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,520
he will never let you down.

57
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,986
- So sweet.
- Hear, hear!

58
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,500
Thank you.

59
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:02,666
You can send the cheque now.

60
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:05,465
Tanya...

61
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:07,470
thank you.

62
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,840
Let me warn you...

63
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,409
Nikhil is planning a
full power bachelor party.

64
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:13,713
Too late.

65
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,409
His school friends have planned
a bachelor holiday.

66
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:17,705
A road trip...

67
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:18,747
through Spain.

68
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,050
- A road trip?
- Don't ask.

69
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,990
They had made some pact
in college that...

70
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,060
each one would choose
an adventure sport...

71
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,085
Are you serious?
Like Fear Factor?

72
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:30,584
Exactly!

73
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,154
And the other two would have to do it.

74
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,094
So, what have you picked?

75
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,067
That I can't say.

76
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,636
Not in front of me, at least.

77
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,838
You see...

78
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:45,139
the sport we pick
is a surprise for the other two.

79
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:46,600
Shut up!

80
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,211
- Seriously.
- Are you kidding me?

81
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,570
No.

82
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,749
That ensures none of us back out.

83
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,243
Whose idea was this?

84
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:56,414
Mine.

85
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:57,850
Three weeks.

86
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,388
You know how these boys are.

87
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:00,449
Not Kabir.

88
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,420
Oh please!

89
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,322
All guys go crazy at bachelor parties.

90
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,626
In fact...

91
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,433
Nikhil still hasn't told me
what happened at his.

92
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,737
I don't know.

93
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,135
I heard something about
your bachelor party.

94
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,614
Who told you?

95
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,851
So it is true.

96
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:27,751
Does Natasha know?

97
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:29,949
No man, why would I tell her?

98
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,746
Please... don't tell her.

99
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,482
She was from Ukraine.

100
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,259
- Bloody hot!
- Nice.

101
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:38,527
I was sloshed.

102
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,123
Okay, listen...

103
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,992
If Sameera finds out about this,
she'll kill me.

104
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,969
I know, don't worry.

105
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,208
It was my last night as a bachelor.
You know I'd never do it otherwise.

106
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,244
I understand, don't worry about it.

107
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,233
- Please.
- It happens.

108
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:54,813
Sameera!

109
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,375
Sorry, I couldn't resist.

110
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,084
- Take care, man.
- See you.

111
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,855
Trust me, this trick never fails.

112
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,929
What do you mean?

113
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:14,457
Well, you tell people you know
something about them...

114
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,737
and before you know it,
they tell you their secrets.

115
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,071
Shut up!

116
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,266
You didn't know about the Ukrainian?

117
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,039
No, he just told me.

118
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,038
Mind blowing!

119
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,214
- Yeah, well time equals money, Simon.
You want money, stop wasting my time.

120
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,818
Sell 50,000 June contracts!

121
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,116
50,000 and don't screw up
my stop losses this time!

122
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,153
How much?

123
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,690
Damn! That's horrendous!

124
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,657
Sell it. Sell everything.

125
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,538
Listen Joe, if you continue to give me
bullshit fills like that...

126
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,665
I'm going to have to trade
my Ferrari in for a Ford Fiesta!

127
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,871
We have white and gold and...

128
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,607
tonnes of champagne.

129
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:02,944
And...

130
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,244
- the centre peice.
- This is nice.

131
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,117
Finally!

132
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:08,381
Kabira!

133
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,413
Sorry man.

134
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,219
You have no idea what's happening here.

135
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,552
And you have no idea
what a nice party you missed.

136
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,723
I'm sure, man.

137
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,220
Listen...

138
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:19,926
I've a problem.

139
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,201
I can't make it to Spain.

140
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:22,724
- What?!

141
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,505
Arjun, you promised!

142
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,273
I know but...

143
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,299
I thought this deal I'm working on
would come through...

144
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:31,102
- but I'm stuck.

145
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,509
I can't believe you're ditching me
on my bachelor trip.

146
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,816
It's not that...

147
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,181
- Then what is it?

148
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,908
We had decided to do this together.

149
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,054
If you can't make it,
I'm calling it off.

150
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,621
Don't get sentimental.
It's my work!

151
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,395
I'm not.

152
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,265
It's been cancelled once before,
so let's do it again.

153
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,562
It's fine.

154
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:58,392
It's either the three of us going
or none at all.

155
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,553
Hey...

156
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,258
Hi.

157
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,157
How are you?

158
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,530
Good.

159
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,903
Looking good,
you've been working out?

160
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:31,994
Yes.

161
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,028
I usually come in the morning.

162
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,176
I was going to call you.

163
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,070
Then why didn't you?

164
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,015
I'm getting married.

165
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,747
- That was quick.
- Arjun, please!

166
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:58,994
All the best, Rohini.

167
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,516
- Arjun, it's me again.

168
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,920
- Don't ditch me.

169
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,411
- I know why you're making excuses.

170
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,058
- But it's been four years
for that incident.

171
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,047
- I'm getting married now.

172
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,255
- Even today, I only have two friends.

173
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,529
- We're the three Musketeers.
All for one, one for all.

174
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,298
Have you thought about...

175
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,566
what we spoke?

176
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,003
About what?

177
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,741
Are you moving back to Bombay?

178
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,339
Ammi...

179
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:56,154
I like Delhi and living on my own.

180
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,765
And this trip to Spain...

181
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,427
is it a coincidence or
did you plan it?

182
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,070
Why don't you just say
what you're really thinking?

183
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:15,540
Fine.

184
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,336
Do you intend to meet Salman?

185
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,113
I don't know.

186
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,138
Imran, why don't you trust me?

187
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,551
It's not about you Ammi.

188
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,920
- He is my father.
- He's your father?

189
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,085
Has he ever called you
or tried to find out how you are?

190
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,150
Maybe he did and
you kept it from me.

191
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:39,028
Until recently I wasrt even aware
that he is my father.

192
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,423
Alright.

193
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,169
Do what you want.

194
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,705
But please remember this.

195
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,730
Faisal was your only father.

196
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,906
- Hello there.
- Hello.

197
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,683
I can see you.

198
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,852
I miss you, baby.

199
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,343
Now we can see each other everyday.

200
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,056
I'm only going for
three weeks, Natasha.

201
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,131
What will I do in London all alone?

202
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,771
You'll shop.

203
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:22,969
And in three weeks I'll come to London
to carry your shopping bags.

204
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,033
- Very funny.
- I know.

205
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,069
- I don't see Madrid in this plan.
- Because it's not there.

206
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,934
- We travel to Spain but
we're not going to see the capital?

207
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,073
- We don't have enough time.

208
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,768
- We can't change it now.
- I think we should.

209
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,172
Look who's here!

210
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,671
- Welcome! How was your flight?
- Hello.

211
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:22,948
Well...

212
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,142
it flew.

213
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,744
Funny!

214
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,895
- Good to see you.
- You too.

215
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:37,953
I'm sorry about Abu.

216
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,458
I got your email.

217
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,262
- How's Ammi?
- She's fine.

218
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,066
It's not easy to get over these things.

219
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,495
How've you been?

220
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:49,772
I'm good.

221
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,176
Pretty good actually.

222
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,303
I've a new apartment.
Three bedrooms, big space.

223
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,047
Nice.

224
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,349
I can't believe we're together again.

225
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,044
- Yeah.
- Finally!

226
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,316
Should we sit?

227
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,184
So, here is the plan.

228
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,890
First...

229
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,450
we go to Costa Brava,
which is my choice.

230
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,056
Then Arjun wants to go to Seville.

231
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,097
And then we'll head to...

232
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,621
Pampalona which you've chosen.

233
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,894
Tomorrow morning we leave for
Costa Brava.

234
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,669
What are you doing with the laptop?

235
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,577
I'm looking for an address.

236
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:26,874
Hola Kabira.

237
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,739
Kabira...

238
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,209
Your treasure.

239
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,115
Brilliant. Thanks a ton.

240
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,986
What have you done to this?

241
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,452
Dude!

242
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:47,199
First of all, be thankful that
I bought this 12,000 Euro bag for you!

243
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,097
What?

244
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,227
Here... show, show...

245
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,671
12,000 Euro for this purse?

246
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,507
Way more than your salary.

247
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,471
What?

248
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,139
Natasha loves these bags.

249
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,812
And I love cars, Kabir.

250
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,780
Always remember.

251
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,913
If you ever want to gift
me an expensive car...

252
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,658
don't hesitate.

253
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,093
I won't.

254
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:14,616
Good.

255
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:15,694
Let's go.

256
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,025
I can't.

257
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,598
I need to make some calls.

258
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,394
I'll see you guys later.

259
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,199
Adios amigos.

260
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,564
- I thought this was a holiday.
- Me too.

261
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,933
Let's go.

262
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,175
We take the next right.

263
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,813
- Looks quite old.
- There it is.

264
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:40,911
There is the cathedral.

265
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,313
- Do you know where this place is?
- Yes, straight ahead.

266
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,213
How far is this gallery?

267
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,026
Shut up!

268
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,657
It's just here.

269
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,729
This is the street.
Catonia... whatever.

270
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:55,960
And that's the place.

271
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,194
I guess.

272
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,208
Hey!

273
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,777
Salman Habib.

274
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,048
It's a desi name.

275
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,752
He must be Pakistani or Indian.

276
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,303
Thanks.

277
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,347
I wish you'd come with us.

278
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,508
We walked all over
looking for his gallery.

279
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,812
Man, this city is beautiful.

280
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,911
Well, today I made
a 2,000 Pound commission, so...

281
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,353
excuse me if I don't complain.

282
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:52,818
Cheers.

283
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,358
- 2,000 Pounds?
- Yup!

284
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:55,192
Cheers.

285
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:00,798
Dude...

286
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,697
I heard something about you.

287
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:04,596
What?

288
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:07,963
You know what it is.

289
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:10,738
Mom told you?

290
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:14,738
Yes.

291
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,050
But did she tell you I was forced?

292
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,876
- Okay?
- Okay.

293
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,312
God man!
She can't keep anything to herself.

294
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,418
She's driving me crazy, man.

295
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:27,859
Yeah.

296
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,528
She came to London a few days ago.

297
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,697
And dragged me to
some friend's relative's place.

298
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:32,527
To see a girl.

299
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,128
Neelu aunty and
Gogi uncle's daughter Cookie.

300
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,334
I'd decided that I'd go,
have some tea...

301
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,405
exchange pleasantries and
decline the match.

302
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,744
As I took the first sip...

303
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,972
Cookie said 'no'!

304
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,536
So... you know...

305
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:49,881
What?!

306
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,542
I mean, so what!
What is there?

307
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:57,683
What?

308
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:01,959
Come on, man!

309
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,458
You were set up for
an arranged marriage...

310
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,765
and you got rejected?

311
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,097
But I didn't even try
to create an impression.

312
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,036
- Now you're just saying it.
- I didn't want to impress her!

313
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,367
You've ruined our reputation.

314
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,270
Shut up, please stop it!

315
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,003
Why did she have to tell you?
What's wrong with her?

316
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,214
Actually, your mom said nothing.

317
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,684
It's his latest trick.
And you're his latest victim.

318
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:26,708
- Cheers!

319
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,644
2,000 Pounds!

320
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,654
Grow up, man!

321
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:37,393
How old are you?

322
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:39,955
You know what...

323
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,933
we have to have some shots.

324
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,265
- One for Cookie.
- We'll raise a toast to Cookie.

325
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,394
Okay.

326
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,874
Not for me.

327
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,364
I have a conference call
in an hour.

328
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,334
Same old plan?

329
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,038
Mint money and retire at 40?

330
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,437
Yup!

331
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:56,412
That's the plan.

332
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,927
Listen...

333
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:09,951
thank you.

334
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,629
For what?

335
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,455
For coming on this trip.
It means a lot to me.

336
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,562
I'm sure it does.

337
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,713
Literacy is the key.

338
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:29,340
It's not that simple.

339
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,151
Oh - my - God!

340
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:41,685
Kabira, amazing choice.

341
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,620
She's gorgeous but she isn't ours.

342
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,686
What?

343
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:48,890
An SUV will be a lot comfortable.

344
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:52,398
To hell with the comfort.
Just look at her!

345
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,435
Guys?

346
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,446
- Hola, good morning.
Your name?

347
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:02,413
- Kabir Dewan.
- Guys!

348
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:04,976
Kabir... Arjun...

349
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:06,878
She's beautiful.

350
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:13,013
I've booked an SUV and
they've charged me, sorry.

351
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,124
Sell Natasha's purse.

352
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,362
Funny.

353
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,223
Please!

354
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,199
What are you doing?
Behave yourself!

355
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,327
Oh, don't even
think about it, dude.

356
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,506
All my life I sat in your car.

357
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,341
Now it's my turn.

358
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:36,915
What are you doing?

359
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,315
12,000 Euro. She rides first class.

360
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,912
Hey Sarah, what's up?
Mr. Yamamoto called?

361
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,617
Well, he'll have
the docket in two days.

362
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:54,253
No, no don't say I'm on a holiday.
Just get Joe to call me back. Bye.

363
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,688
Hey Joe, what's up?

364
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,059
Like... 'now' now?

365
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:09,806
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, I'll do it, bye.

366
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,110
Sorry guys.

367
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:36,331
Guys... ten minutes tops!

368
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,065
Moshi moshi, Arjun-san.

369
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,402
Moshi moshi, Yamamoto-san.

370
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,378
How are you?

371
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,073
I'm fine, thank you.

372
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,545
Moshi, moshi?

373
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,082
It's Japanese for hello.

374
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,717
- I assure you,
I will always be here for you.

375
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,589
Kabira...

376
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,354
Look at this amazing view.

377
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,956
And, now look at our friend.

378
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,566
My team is going to
put together all the information.

379
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,124
And you will have
the docket with you in three days.

380
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:11,891
What happened to him, dude?

381
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,429
If you ask me...

382
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,338
he has become mantally sick.

383
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,803
And he needs the psychaitrixt.

384
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:23,541
Isn't this from school?

385
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,143
Not school.

386
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:27,707
- Eschool!
- Eschool.

387
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:28,720
Eschool!

388
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,121
Because only the Mr. The Dubey
can the talk like this.

389
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:34,752
The Mr. The Dubey.

390
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:39,126
Are you mantally challanged my buy?

391
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:41,532
Not buy.

392
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,002
Bwoy.

393
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,171
- Bwoy.

394
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,073
Mantally challangedmy bwoy...

395
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,062
Mantal bwoy.

396
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,074
Thank you, Mr. Yamamoto.

397
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,575
Let's go. I'm done.

398
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:57,906
Arjun, my bwoy...

399
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:01,249
you look the mantalin this the uniform!

400
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,018
Let's go.

401
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,317
Okay, the very the well the saids.

402
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,385
Guys...

403
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,216
just do as I say.

404
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:39,057
It's been ten years since college.
Please grow up.

405
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,617
- Don't do this, please.
- Trust me.

406
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,593
You'll kiss me later.

407
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,897
When I shout...

408
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:49,094
point to the urinal and
scream loudly.

409
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,247
Bye!

410
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,053
Dude, you're the mantallythe sick!

411
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,991
People are the same everywhere.

412
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,557
It's just human nature.

413
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,135
What are you doing?

414
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,238
Poor thing's feeling hot.

415
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:36,643
Poor thing?

416
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,143
Kabira...

417
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,482
meet Bagwati.

418
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,346
What's happened to your jokes?

419
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,855
Are they sick?

420
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,491
Well, they've taken after you.

421
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:54,254
Hey Joe, yes I spoke to
Mr. Yamamoto and...

422
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,058
Somebody please
throw his phone out.

423
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:00,762
What the...

424
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:03,908
- Are you mad?

425
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,066
Did you just...

426
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,618
You think we'll get it?

427
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,564
Sorry, I didn't think he would do it.

428
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,259
Of course you didn't know, Kabir.

429
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,526
Now go find my phone.

430
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:31,959
- Where?
- I don't know.

431
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,333
I want my phone, that's all.

432
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,439
It could've broken.

433
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,634
Arjun, don't be silly...
we won't find it.

434
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,538
Silly?

435
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,339
You threw my phone out
of a moving car, you moron!

436
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,307
He said it, I threw it.

437
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:43,870
Didrt you?

438
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,447
Kabir...

439
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,075
please tell me to slap him.

440
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,052
Don't be silly.

441
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:48,950
Just tell me to slap him.

442
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:50,719
Just tell me to slap him.

443
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,152
Slap him.

444
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:55,989
- What's wrong with you?
- Guys!

445
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:58,793
I'll get you a new phone.
I was just joking.

446
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,598
Well, it's not funny.

447
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,225
That call was important.

448
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:06,232
You think being 'cool and funny'
gives you the license to do anything?

449
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,840
It's always like,
'lmran said this. He's so funny.'

450
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,608
Lmran did that, he is so cool'.

451
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:11,943
Grow up!

452
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,934
Throwing my phone
out the window is not funny!

453
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:17,311
Hooking up with my girlfriend
was not funny!

454
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:24,155
Listen...

455
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:26,247
it's been four years.

456
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,892
And I've apologised for it.

457
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,450
Now let it go.

458
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,493
Or what? Huh, what?

459
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,994
Stop it. Stop it, you two.

460
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,894
You're behaving like kids.

461
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,795
If there's a problem,
deal with it.

462
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:41,497
Like adults.

463
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,033
Who made you the judge?

464
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:44,442
Do you see anyone else here?

465
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:45,170
Listen.

466
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,078
Let's get this straight.

467
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,238
I don't have any problem with him.

468
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,050
Why would you have a problem?

469
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,449
Sonali was my girlfriend.

470
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,309
Come on, Sonali and me
fell in love.

471
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,087
It happens. Shit happens.

472
00:30:59,023 --> 00:30:59,421
Yeah.

473
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:01,454
It was shit.

474
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,323
For me.

475
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,795
And I'm sure you didn't
give it a second thought.

476
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,160
Imran man...

477
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,328
I would never do that to you.

478
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:14,467
Arjun...

479
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,234
I screwed up.
Now what do you want me to do?

480
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:18,501
What do I do?

481
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,041
Should I wear a 'Sorry, Arjur t-shirt
and walk around?

482
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,036
What should I do?

483
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:23,273
Just look at him.

484
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:26,047
Listen to me, okay.
You two, please!

485
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,707
Sonali was a bitch.

486
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:29,209
Understand?

487
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,718
I'm sorry, really.

488
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,480
She used you.

489
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,956
Then gave you a BPL
and used him.

490
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,723
And she dumped you as well.

491
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:38,795
She was a waste of time then
and she is a waste of time now.

492
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:42,930
Four years ago we cancelled
this trip because of her.

493
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,993
Today we're here for me.
Don't let her ruin this.

494
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,101
Please!

495
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,397
How many times
do I have to apologise?

496
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,875
How many times?
Let's just make it clear.

497
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,048
Till it doesn't come from here.

498
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,047
What's BPL?

499
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:07,855
Bum Pe Laat.
[Kick in the arse.]

500
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,200
You're crazy.

501
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,725
Speak with him.
He slapped me.

502
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,097
I can't believe this.

503
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,118
Hi baby...

504
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:38,950
Good.

505
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,616
We've left Barcelona.

506
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,191
On the road.

507
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:46,620
Yes, it's beautiful.

508
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:50,901
Of course, they're with me.
Where will they go?

509
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:54,436
Everything is cool.

510
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:57,574
Yeah.

511
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,561
All ready.

512
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:17,858
Come on.

513
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:21,322
Yes!

514
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,934
Now this is a house.

515
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,629
- I like.
- Cool.

516
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:25,903
It's lovely.

517
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,803
You haven't seen the half of it yet.

518
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,464
Can we slide?

519
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:31,840
No, you can't.

520
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:33,611
- Captain.
- Amazing.

521
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:34,942
Wow, man!

522
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:37,274
This is nicer than the pictures.

523
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:43,755
Amazing.

524
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:44,744
What a view!

525
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,053
Someday.

526
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:36,674
How was it?

527
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:37,698
Refreshing.

528
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,840
Who is she?

529
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,039
How should I know, dude?

530
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,474
She's nice.

531
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:49,316
Really nice.

532
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,350
What's happening?

533
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,919
She's got me.
She's pulling me towards her.

534
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,326
She's pulling me.

535
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,727
I saw her first.

536
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:02,290
So true.

537
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:06,196
But has she seen you?

538
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:09,801
What?

539
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,067
- Hola.
- Hola.

540
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,105
Can I try that?

541
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:18,380
Yeah.

542
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:19,777
Thanks.

543
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,023
Where are you from?

544
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:26,751
Brazil?

545
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:29,220
Half US, half India.

546
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:30,621
India?

547
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,530
What a coincidence!
Which part?

548
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,495
My dad's from Delhi but
I live in London.

549
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,226
Hindi? Not bad!

550
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,661
You too... wow!

551
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,878
If you're free,
want to join me for a drink?

552
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,206
I have an early morning.

553
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:56,250
Sorry.

554
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,127
Thanks.

555
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:13,260
Bye.

556
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,299
What's your name?

557
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,173
Laila.

558
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,372
Imran.

559
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:24,809
But my friends call me 'Romeo'.

560
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,095
Romeo?

561
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,393
Seriously man... Romeo?

562
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,098
I mean, chee!

563
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:44,295
Arjun...

564
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,404
It's a mars duty to try.

565
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,935
Success and failure are in His hands.

566
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:52,936
Great, professor.

567
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:55,905
Seriously?

568
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,011
You got me this time!

569
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:09,721
What the hell is this?

570
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:11,624
What?

571
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:16,597
This! What the hell is this?

572
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,203
You said I had to
get you a new phone.

573
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:20,397
You didn't specify which one.

574
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,373
I'm a trader.

575
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:23,567
Not a Japanese school girl.

576
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:25,338
Moshi moshi.

577
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,508
Shut up, just shut up!

578
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,381
- Just don't talk to me.
- Guys that's enough!

579
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,341
Look at this.
What's wrong with him?

580
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,317
What's wrong with you?

581
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,052
It's funny.

582
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,324
Anyway, now listen.

583
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:41,951
Why we are here in Costa Brava.

584
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,091
Ready for this?

585
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:45,427
Yeah.

586
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,393
Deep... sea...

587
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:50,624
diving.

588
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:53,362
What?

589
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,366
Yes, our training begins
first thing tomorrow.

590
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,709
I'm sorry but...

591
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,878
why is this turning into a
let's torture Arjun holiday?

592
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,246
I just don't understand.

593
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:03,914
Relax, I know.

594
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,814
I spoke with the people
at the diving school.

595
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,885
You don't need to know how to swim.

596
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:09,750
At least you know how to drown.

597
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,223
Listen, just keep quiet. Just...

598
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:13,383
keep quiet.

599
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,120
Kabir...

600
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,554
I don't understand how you thought
I'll do this.

601
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:18,988
What's wrong with you?

602
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:27,531
Bathroom... to the left.

603
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,576
Okay, listen.

604
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,641
I know you're scared of water.

605
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:40,179
Okay.

606
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:43,544
But then that's the challenge.
And it's completely safe.

607
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,356
Think about it.

608
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,914
Blue waters... okay?

609
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,618
Fish swimming close to you.

610
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,487
Corals...

611
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,187
It'll be amazing.

612
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:00,560
Look, if you're not comfortable,
no one's going to force you.

613
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:03,763
No, I'm serious, it's okay.

614
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,539
Okay. Fine.

615
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:19,213
Kabir Dewan?

616
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,259
Laila?

617
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:22,748
Hey.

618
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,226
Hi, what are you doing here?

619
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,386
Following you, I guess.

620
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,061
Really?

621
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:29,790
No.

622
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,134
I'm here to train you.

623
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,234
I'm an instructor here.

624
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:34,465
Wow!

625
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,575
- Hi, I'm Kabir.
- Laila.

626
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:38,974
- This is Arjun.
- Hi.

627
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:39,509
Laila.

628
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:42,402
Romeo?

629
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:44,142
You remember?

630
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,585
Arjun...

631
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:51,043
If you don't want to dive,
it's totally fine.

632
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:53,581
He can't swim.

633
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:57,524
It's okay, doesn't matter.

634
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:59,129
You'll be fine.

635
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:01,690
Thank you.

636
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,125
Shall we start?

637
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:05,699
Let's go.

638
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,295
It's a little difficult to
talk under water.

639
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:09,839
For obvious reasons.

640
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,598
So these signs are very important.

641
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:13,941
Up.

642
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:16,641
Down.

643
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,746
Okay.

644
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,710
Not okay.

645
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:23,212
Air guage.

646
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:25,579
Okay?

647
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:28,350
Okay?

648
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,386
Alright!

649
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,693
You have to wear a wet suit.

650
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,357
The water is pretty cold.

651
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,503
Next is the BCD.
Your buoyancy control device.

652
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,964
All okay?

653
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,837
These weights will help you
remain underwater.

654
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,447
Finally, your fins.

655
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,112
Cheers. Salut.

656
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:29,010
Good job, boys.

657
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:36,250
So, when is the wedding?

658
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,089
In two months.

659
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:41,751
- That's like now, man.
- Yeah, I know.

660
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:44,316
We only started dating
about six months ago.

661
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:45,922
Well, you know what they say...

662
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:47,020
when it's right, it's right.

663
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,387
That's what I said.

664
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:49,829
Actually, she said it.

665
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:53,833
What does she do?

666
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,102
Interior design.
And she's bloody good.

667
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:57,502
Okay.

668
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,304
And of course,
her father has a hotel business...

669
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:00,570
that's evaluated at...

670
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:02,471
Ten billion?

671
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:03,777
Ten billion.

672
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,779
I'm not marrying her for her money.

673
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,753
Kabir, of course not.

674
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,812
But you've got to admit,
it's a plus point.

675
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,880
Plus point?
Are you serious?

676
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,919
Would you marry for money?

677
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:19,593
Depends.

678
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:20,962
How much?

679
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,058
Ten billion!

680
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:25,933
Definitely.

681
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,635
And what if she's a bore?

682
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:34,508
When you have ten billion in your bank
who needs the wife for entertainment?

683
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:36,976
- Romantic.
- I agree, it's true.

684
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:38,838
- Cheers!

685
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:42,676
Are you seeing someone?

686
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:45,447
Do you have a girlfriend?

687
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,079
No.

688
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:51,028
Hey... what about Rohini?
What happened there?

689
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,097
- She was nice.
- Well...

690
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:55,292
I guess she wanted
different things out of life.

691
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:57,000
Laila...

692
00:43:57,768 --> 00:44:00,794
apart from my body
what else do you want out of life?

693
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:09,676
I don't know.
I haven't really made a list.

694
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:10,981
Still...

695
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,472
there must be something.

696
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,548
I guess, I want that...

697
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:22,255
life should continue to surprise me.

698
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,020
Inspire me.

699
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,562
Make me meet new people.

700
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:28,425
Hola.

701
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:30,697
Hola.

702
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,499
Hola?

703
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:34,226
Sorry.

704
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,302
Give me new experiences.

705
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:37,964
And...

706
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,202
I want...

707
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:42,806
you to get me a drink.

708
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:46,304
Your wish is my command.

709
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:47,950
- One for me, please.
- Arjun?

710
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:49,777
I'm okay.

711
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:59,954
- Keep it down.
- Guys we're gonna get arrested.

712
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,963
He's here. Quiet.

713
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,563
I was just telling...

714
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:14,070
that's the problem you see.

715
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:28,949
Sorry.

716
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,914
Your life is about to change.

717
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,547
That's if I survive!

718
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:02,681
We'll see.

719
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,821
Yup, we'll see.

720
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,851
The moment flows by like molten sapphire

721
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,393
Deep blue silences

722
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:08,169
No earth below, no sky above

723
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:13,533
The rustling branches and leaves

724
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,045
Are saying only you are here

725
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:21,508
Only me

726
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:24,810
My breath and my heartbeat

727
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:30,057
Such depth, such solitude

728
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:33,252
And me

729
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:34,527
Only me

730
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,565
I now believe I esist

731
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,847
Baby, it was amazing.
You should definitely do it.

732
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,879
I have no interest.

733
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,255
Hey!

734
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:58,914
Hey...

735
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:01,457
Sorry. Can I use your loo?
Lmran is taking a shower.

736
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:02,383
Sure.

737
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,024
Who is that?

738
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:05,793
Wait. First say hi to Natasha.

739
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:08,164
Okay.

740
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,930
Hey... I'm Laila.

741
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:13,296
Hi.

742
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,935
Kabir has told me a lot about you.

743
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,371
Congratulations in advance.

744
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:18,806
Thanks.

745
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:21,200
Well, it's really nice to meet you.

746
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:23,970
- Bye.
- Bye.

747
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:26,838
Who is that?

748
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:28,852
That's Laila, our instructor.

749
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:30,353
She's studying fashion in London but...

750
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:33,256
three months a year she works
at dive sites around the world.

751
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,424
Isn't that cool?

752
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,258
Very cool.

753
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,055
What is she doing in your room?

754
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,792
She's using the bathroom.

755
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:44,935
Imran invited her over for dinner.

756
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,096
To celebrate our first dive.

757
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:48,595
D'you think I'm stupid?

758
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,839
What? It's the truth.

759
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:51,931
Arjun is cooking.

760
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:54,336
Yeah, you must be very busy.
I'll speak to you later.

761
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,569
Natasha, why are you getting upset?

762
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,075
I'm not upset.
I've a flight to catch.

763
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,181
You're being really silly.

764
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,342
Yeah, I know. Bye.

765
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:05,618
Bye.

766
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:11,893
- All okay?
- Yeah, fine.

767
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,294
- See you downstairs.
- See you.

768
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,711
Need some help?

769
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,406
Nope. Almost done.

770
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,484
Paella.

771
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:35,451
- Yup.
- Very nice.

772
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,017
Thanks.

773
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:43,226
So...

774
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,552
you didn't tell me how it was.

775
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:49,732
Thank you.

776
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:53,066
Don't thank me.
You did it.

777
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:57,707
So, how was it?

778
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:02,242
It was magical.

779
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:07,006
It felt like the
most peaceful place on earth.

780
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,679
It was beautiful.

781
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,846
I was 16 when I did my first dive.

782
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:18,226
And then stopping myself
was impossible.

783
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:20,926
Yeah, it could be addictive.

784
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:22,194
Addictive?

785
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:23,922
No.

786
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:25,892
Addiction is such a negative word.

787
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:27,730
Diving is...

788
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:29,702
something else for me.

789
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,936
It's like meditation.

790
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:37,203
You're conscious of
every breath, every moment.

791
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:39,313
Just imagine...

792
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,714
living your whole life like that.

793
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,785
Be fully alive to each and every moment.

794
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:49,823
Delicious.

795
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:50,757
- Seriously.
- Thank you.

796
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:51,885
You should cook more often.

797
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:53,286
I know man but...

798
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:54,721
where's the time!

799
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:00,829
So, the fear of water still there?

800
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:02,838
Now there's no fear.

801
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:04,931
Not even of life.

802
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,738
Wow! In one dunk
you've unravelled the mystery of life!

803
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:10,941
Well done, my lad.

804
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:14,473
Actually, it's quite simple.

805
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:16,686
What is it?

806
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:20,189
Just...

807
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:22,391
keep breathing.

808
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:30,092
Laila!

809
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,300
Finally, our old friend has surfaced.

810
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,296
And to avoid a relapse...

811
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,799
why don't you join us on the trip?

812
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,602
I'd love to.

813
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:42,201
But I'm off to Buñol tomorrow.

814
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,045
It's the Tomatina festival.

815
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:45,112
- Too bad!
- Is it?

816
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,083
Toma-tina, what's that?

817
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,414
Arjun!

818
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:50,587
How can you not know that...

819
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:54,148
it is world s largest tomato fight?!

820
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:59,062
It's like our festival of colours.
But played with tomatoes instead.

821
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:00,063
Really?

822
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,599
Actually, you guys should come.

823
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:03,793
It'll be a blast.

824
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:05,791
I'm in.

825
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:07,270
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm in.

826
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:08,999
What? No!

827
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:10,273
We're leaving for Seville tomorrow.

828
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:12,002
That's perfect.
Buñol is en-route.

829
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:13,703
- Come on.

830
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:17,144
Look, Seville is Arjurs choice.

831
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:19,040
He made the reservations.

832
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:23,575
To mess with Arjurs reservations is...

833
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,120
like inviting Death!

834
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,226
Come on.

835
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:38,924
Alright, let me see what I can do.

836
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:43,966
Is that your phone?

837
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,169
It's a long story.

838
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:53,071
Let's not go there.

839
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:54,446
No, it's nice.

840
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:56,920
He's very much in touch
with his feminine side.

841
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,978
Eat your food.

842
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:00,557
Don't worry, even I like pink.

843
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:01,956
Great, I feel much better.
Thank you.

844
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:11,226
How could you do this?

845
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:13,603
Rohini, I'm really sorry but...

846
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:15,298
can't you see that
this deal could help me.

847
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,101
Can't you see that maybe I don't care!

848
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,441
You don't care.

849
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:20,671
- You don't care about my life?
- Stop it, Arjun.

850
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:23,144
Don't confuse your work with your life.

851
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,406
Your work isn't your life.
It's just a part of it.

852
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,753
Just like this relationship
is a part of your life.

853
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:31,653
- What about this?
- What about this?

854
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:34,588
I bought this apartment so that
we could live together.

855
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,559
What? Please!

856
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:41,064
You bought this apartment to impress people
with your up market address.

857
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,732
I can't believe you just said that.

858
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,929
- I'm planning a future with you.
- Our future will come tomorrow, Arjun.

859
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:48,037
- Don't scream!
- Where is our today?

860
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:49,205
Don't scream.

861
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:50,331
Then listen to me.

862
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:53,767
What do you want?

863
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,802
I want to spend time with you.

864
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:59,416
I want a relationship.
Not a retirement plan.

865
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,906
Please, Rohini.

866
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:04,087
The chairman of Nakatomi Corporation
wants a meeting with me.

867
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,816
What do I do?
I have to go.

868
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:11,087
If the presentation does it,
he'll give us the entire account.

869
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:13,530
That will boost my career.

870
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,088
Can't you see that?

871
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:16,325
What about our deal?

872
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,062
We can go next month.

873
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:22,766
It's my birthday, Arjun.

874
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,742
- I know.
- It won't come next month.

875
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:31,876
You had promised that we would
go to Italy no matter what.

876
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:35,050
And you cancelled the tickets
without even talking to me.

877
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:39,781
Rohini, I really am sorry.

878
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:42,884
Please understand. Just a second.

879
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,186
It's an important call.
Just one second.

880
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:48,897
Rohini, one second.
Hello...

881
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:52,391
Yes, Alex...

882
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,698
I'll be there in ten minutes.

883
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:22,699
Hey babe, I guess you're on the plane.

884
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:27,570
I called to say that we're going to
Buñol tomorrow, for the Tomatina festiva

885
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,561
Laila is taking us.

886
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:31,763
Please don't be upset.

887
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:37,205
Please call when you get this message.
I love you.

888
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:44,013
Where the hell is he?

889
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:54,427
Oh - my - God!

890
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:04,601
- I love it.
- Unbelievable!

891
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,699
- Okay.
- Yes?

892
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:08,738
- Can I drive?
- No.

893
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:10,678
Kabira...

894
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:14,551
if four days of diving
can do this to you.

895
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,247
Trust me, you should stay under water.

896
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,390
Who knows if I'll be with you guys again...

897
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,592
I decided, it's all or bust!

898
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:24,253
- Right?
- Correct.

899
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,429
Dude, you're getting married.

900
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:28,624
You're not going to prison.

901
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:29,756
Thanks.

902
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:31,724
All set?

903
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:33,025
- Arjun...

904
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:34,461
can you help me?

905
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:37,273
- It's to the right.
- It's jammed, what did you do?

906
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:38,001
Dude!

907
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:41,400
You have to apply some force.

908
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:52,655
- Hi.
- Hello.

909
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:55,624
Child!

910
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:57,527
Relax in the front seat.

911
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:59,085
Driver... Buñol.

912
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:02,730
So Lailaji, hale and hearty
both packed in the bag?

913
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:10,306
No, thanks.

914
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:27,313
What are you doing?

915
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:31,325
Laila, meet Bagwati.

916
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:36,054
Hi Bagwati.

917
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:41,235
Bagwatithinks you are very beautiful.

918
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:43,336
Thank you, Bagwati.

919
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:48,533
The evening was hazy...

920
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:51,206
The mood was sad...

921
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:54,677
A thousand memories vanished as they came...

922
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:59,422
That's really nice.
You wrote it?

923
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:00,650
I wish...

924
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:02,953
It's by Raghupati Sahai Firaq.

925
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:05,824
Even our man writes quite well.

926
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:07,385
- Really?
- Thanks man.

927
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:10,563
- What say, Kabir?
- Of course.

928
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:18,604
Diamond biscuit Diamond biscuit...
Whenever in a mood just have it...

929
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,177
Diamond biscuit Diamond biscuit...
For a healthy life just taste it...

930
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:25,136
Whenever mummy daddy bring it out...
All the happy kids squeal and shout...

931
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:30,250
Diamond biscuit Diamond biscuit...
For a healthy life just taste it...

932
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:35,218
Now available in a new coconut flavour.

933
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:40,163
- So beautiful.
- One has to do it, assholes!

934
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:42,063
Inspired writing.

935
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:45,398
- It's kind of nice.
- Isn't it?

936
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:48,404
Brought a smile to your face, didn't it?

937
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:49,393
Hello.

938
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,306
Hi, it's me.

939
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:54,405
- Where are you?
- Just landed in London.

940
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,180
Look...

941
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,842
I'm sorry I hung up yesterday.

942
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,777
It's okay.
You know what, just forget about it.

943
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,379
Thank you.

944
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:06,911
So, you're going Buñol?

945
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,064
Chee!

946
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,362
- What happened?
- What are you doing?

947
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:22,561
Sorry.

948
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:25,199
Yes.

949
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:30,536
- Laila, where are we staying?
- Hotel Venta Pilar.

950
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,307
Some Venta Pilar...

951
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:35,749
Venta Pilar.

952
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:38,218
Okay, fine.

953
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:40,687
Well you have fun, okay.

954
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:42,484
Okay, of course.

955
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:45,925
Arjun...

956
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:47,996
what are you doing man?

957
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,657
- Again?
- What are you doing?

958
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:53,236
I'm sorry, it's the wind.
I'm really sorry.

959
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:53,895
Really?

960
01:02:55,505 --> 01:03:01,068
By the way, Bagwatiis feeling kinda hot.
I'll let her get some wind by the window.

961
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:17,624
- Turn left here.
- Yeah?

962
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:22,291
- I know I'll see her somewhere.

963
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:24,355
There she is.

964
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:34,699
- Hola!

965
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:41,375
Everybody this is Nuria.

966
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:43,379
- Hola.
- Arjun.

967
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:45,347
- That's Kabir.
- Hello.

968
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:46,816
And that's lmran in the corner.

969
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:49,221
- Hola!

970
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:56,626
She's saying it's already started.

971
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:57,825
We have to go.
We're going to miss it.

972
01:03:58,534 --> 01:03:59,262
Imran.

973
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,496
- The bags?
- These guys will take care of them.

974
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:05,037
- But my laptop.
- Arjun, let's go. Come on!

975
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:06,875
- Okay.
- Imran.

976
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:09,304
We're leaving you.

977
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:18,782
Laila...

978
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:21,289
your friend is very cute.

979
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:23,259
Is that so?

980
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:24,658
You've already forgotten me?!

981
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:26,217
You're pathetic!

982
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:27,830
Laila...

983
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:31,360
You will go down in history
as my first love.

984
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:36,705
Okay listen guys,
there are two rules.

985
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:38,774
You have to make way for the trucks.

986
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:41,004
And squash the tomatoes
before throwing them.

987
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:42,778
Otherwise it hurts.

988
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:44,405
Alright? Let's go!

989
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:49,841
- Kabira, squash it.
- Did it hurt?

990
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:51,784
- Of course.
- Shit man!

991
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:57,658
What are you guys doing?
There are rules.

992
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,563
Have you ever followed a rule in your life?
You bastard, now you want rules!

993
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,030
Come here!

994
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:06,065
Come here I'll tell you the rules.

995
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,007
Come on!

996
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:36,098
Ooh aah... take the world and paint it red

997
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:39,090
Ooh aah... paint it red

998
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:42,665
There's a passion, a madness

999
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:45,469
All around

1000
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:49,874
A carefree gladness

1001
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:53,078
All around

1002
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:58,581
Somewhere lightly, the colours fall

1003
01:05:58,654 --> 01:06:01,817
Stories of yesterday, you can't recall

1004
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:06,122
Someone softly tells my heart

1005
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:10,188
Give yourself away, let the magic start

1006
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:58,638
This moment that's so whole
Seems high on its own

1007
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:02,244
This moment unveils its intosication on you

1008
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:06,419
Now you're in the mood
You hold hands with the groove

1009
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,715
As voices blend in with the hues

1010
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:44,213
And it's stinking too.

1011
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:51,515
You're going to get this.

1012
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:56,425
- She's going to get it.
- Put me down!

1013
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:04,335
Kabir?

1014
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:07,231
Natasha?

1015
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:11,410
What are you doing?

1016
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:16,714
Hi...

1017
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:34,596
I came here to surprise you.

1018
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,467
I thought you'd be
happy to see me.

1019
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:38,437
I am happy.

1020
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:39,496
Yeah, you look it.

1021
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:41,839
Natasha...

1022
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:43,913
this is my bachelor trip.

1023
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:46,541
And you know, I want to
spend this time with my friends.

1024
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:48,476
Really? Laila is your friend?

1025
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:53,088
She's our diving instructor.
I told you on the phone.

1026
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:54,646
And the other one... Nancy?

1027
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:56,225
Nuria.

1028
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:57,556
Whatever!

1029
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:02,198
Oh God, Natasha!
I just met her this morning!

1030
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:05,861
She was kind enough to give us her room.
We'll probably never see each other again!

1031
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:08,270
That's just perfect!

1032
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:10,135
No one will ever know what happened.

1033
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:13,841
Is that why you are here?

1034
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:17,439
The apology on the phone was
just an excuse to get the address.

1035
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,809
How dare you, Kabir?

1036
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:22,180
- That's really mature...
- Shut up!

1037
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:24,484
Who is it?

1038
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:25,544
Lmran.

1039
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:28,049
Come in.

1040
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:31,260
- Hi.
- Hey.

1041
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,160
I'm sorry, I just need my bag.

1042
01:10:33,596 --> 01:10:35,393
Don't apologise, it's totally cool.

1043
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:36,498
Thanks.

1044
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:44,502
Thanks.

1045
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:47,065
We've made dinner plans,
would you like to join us?

1046
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:49,445
- Actually...
- Yes.

1047
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:51,208
Definitely, sounds like fun.

1048
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:54,616
Okay, I'll call when we're heading out.

1049
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:00,589
We don't have to go.

1050
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:02,989
I don't want your friends to
think I'm a witch!

1051
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,191
Witch alert!

1052
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:09,087
Our holiday is in danger.

1053
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:10,728
Who is next?

1054
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:14,032
Mind if I go first?

1055
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:16,699
Even I love you very much.

1056
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:25,277
Dude, I can't believe Natasha's here.

1057
01:11:25,347 --> 01:11:26,405
I'm shocked!

1058
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:29,443
Why?
What's the big deal?

1059
01:11:29,718 --> 01:11:30,946
Laila...

1060
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:34,922
your fiancée can't crash your bachelor party.
That's the only rule!

1061
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:36,287
Rule?

1062
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,955
- You guys are so stupid.
- What?

1063
01:11:40,262 --> 01:11:41,597
Stupid?

1064
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:42,495
You're stupid.

1065
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:45,265
Natasha hates you.

1066
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:46,535
What?

1067
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:48,264
Yes, she said...

1068
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:49,634
Is Laila your friend?

1069
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:50,903
She asked you that?

1070
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:54,240
No, she asked Kabir.
I was eavesdropping outside the door.

1071
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:57,004
Of course.

1072
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,347
How do you say,
'can I come ir, in Spanish?

1073
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:07,215
Dude, what're you doing?
Don't be stupid!

1074
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:11,956
Yes?

1075
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:20,925
See you in the lobby.

1076
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:52,591
I want to learn Flamenco.
It looks like so much fun.

1077
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:55,398
Laila, you live in Spain?

1078
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:57,170
No, in London.

1079
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,602
So does Arjun.

1080
01:13:00,776 --> 01:13:01,299
Yeah.

1081
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:04,546
Kabir and I will be there
after this holiday.

1082
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:05,945
We should definitely get together.

1083
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:07,683
Yeah, we should.

1084
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:10,584
I'd love to but I'm off to
Morocco from here.

1085
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:12,142
For a month.

1086
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:13,343
Wow!

1087
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:16,413
I think all of you
should come to Seville with us.

1088
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:19,191
I'm going back to London tomorrow.

1089
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:21,397
You only came here for a day?

1090
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:22,091
Yeah.

1091
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,525
Kabir wants to hang with the two of you.

1092
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,936
I don't want to disturb your plans.

1093
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:30,632
Don't be silly, Natasha.
You're hardly a disturbance.

1094
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:35,267
- That's really sweet, lmran.
Thank you.

1095
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:39,644
But, Kabir said it's a miracle to
get you two together.

1096
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:43,443
And you have to attend the wedding.
No excuses.

1097
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:44,743
100 percent!

1098
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:46,243
Of course!

1099
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:48,914
Excuses...

1100
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:51,249
Could we get the more
the red the wines?

1101
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:56,396
Arjun, the translation into the Españols?

1102
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:00,829
Lmran, please!

1103
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:05,067
It's because of such behaviour
that Indians have a bad reputation.

1104
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:07,169
Will you please tell him?

1105
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:10,434
Lmran, don't do it.

1106
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:12,737
Chee!

1107
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:15,014
What chee? He is right!

1108
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:18,720
I agree with you.
Imran, it's wrong.

1109
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,888
No.

1110
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:21,014
I'm the very the sorry

1111
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:23,525
No, I'm sorry.

1112
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:24,423
Not funny!

1113
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:32,901
- Been to Morocco?
- Morocco? No!

1114
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:34,300
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.

1115
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:35,935
Let's go?

1116
01:14:37,339 --> 01:14:38,465
In a bit.

1117
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:40,866
Moshi moshi.

1118
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:43,436
- Will you do me a favour?
- No way!

1119
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:48,647
Why don't you both take a long walk?

1120
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:55,757
Dude, it's late, we're tired.
You must be tired.

1121
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:57,759
- You must be tired.
- No, not really.

1122
01:14:57,759 --> 01:15:00,125
That's the spirit.
The night is young.

1123
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:02,254
You two aren't that old either!

1124
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,322
I'm sure you'll come up
with some plan.

1125
01:15:07,736 --> 01:15:09,966
- You sure?
- Come on.

1126
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:50,142
Shit! I forgot my phone.

1127
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:52,740
Arert you on a holiday?

1128
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:56,807
And, you are absolutely right.

1129
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:02,049
Do you have a boyfriend?

1130
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:03,592
No.

1131
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:04,388
Really?

1132
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:06,294
Why not?

1133
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:09,765
You see, the guys I liked...

1134
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:12,666
wanted different things out of life.

1135
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:19,935
What kind of guys do you like?

1136
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:21,376
What's your type?

1137
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:22,866
I don't have a type.

1138
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:24,371
Come on, everyone has a type.

1139
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:26,544
Really?

1140
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:30,586
Like I know, a guy who gets
only three weeks off in a year...

1141
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:31,985
isn't your type.

1142
01:16:32,054 --> 01:16:34,579
He can't be anyone's type.

1143
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:37,092
He has no time.

1144
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:38,760
He is a slave.

1145
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:42,431
And one who only thinks of his career,
isn't your type either.

1146
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:45,559
If he only thinks about his career,
then he is a bore.

1147
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:49,831
Or someone who thinks money is
the most important thing in life.

1148
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:52,029
Like you!

1149
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:57,474
You don't know anything about me.

1150
01:16:58,914 --> 01:16:59,881
So?

1151
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:02,748
So, don't judge me.

1152
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:07,450
I wasrt judging you.

1153
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:10,392
I'm merely asking...

1154
01:17:10,392 --> 01:17:13,190
does money really make you happy?

1155
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:17,489
I was eight when my dad passed away.

1156
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,597
Leaving behind a huge debt
for my mother.

1157
01:17:22,571 --> 01:17:25,062
Very early I understood that...

1158
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:27,576
only money makes the world go round.

1159
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:29,203
Simple as that.

1160
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:35,774
- I understand, Arjun.

1161
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:38,149
But you still haven't
answered my question.

1162
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:41,781
Yes, money makes me happy.

1163
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:44,388
Then why did you cry,
the other day...

1164
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:46,821
after the dive?

1165
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:51,589
Has a paycheque ever brought
tears to your eyes?

1166
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,131
- No,

1167
01:17:54,736 --> 01:17:56,033
Think about it.

1168
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:59,335
When you've done so well in life...

1169
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:00,875
are you really happy?

1170
01:18:03,378 --> 01:18:05,744
Even today if you feel
something is missing...

1171
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:08,612
what is it?

1172
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:12,087
Take time out for things that...

1173
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:14,078
give you genuine joy.

1174
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:15,357
Like cooking.

1175
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:17,257
Well, that's the plan, I mean...

1176
01:18:17,325 --> 01:18:19,161
I'll retire at 40 and...

1177
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:20,128
Dude!

1178
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:23,089
How do you know
if you'll be alive till then?

1179
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:27,626
Seize the day, my friend.

1180
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,105
First, live this day to the fullest.

1181
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:31,766
Then think about 40.

1182
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,110
Come on.

1183
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:52,356
My friends don't know
why I made them come here.

1184
01:18:54,696 --> 01:18:56,994
Your skin is beautiful.

1185
01:18:58,033 --> 01:18:59,557
I love your colour.

1186
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:05,301
I want to meet Salman Habib.

1187
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:18,475
I've never met him.

1188
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,147
I have never met my father.

1189
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,231
What if he
doesn't want to meet me?

1190
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:50,551
- You're welcome.

1191
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:55,783
Why are we lying here?

1192
01:19:57,726 --> 01:20:00,126
I mean, it's ridiculous.

1193
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:01,423
No.

1194
01:20:01,496 --> 01:20:04,897
It's ridiculous that
you've never done this before.

1195
01:20:06,568 --> 01:20:07,592
What to do?

1196
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:10,596
I'm stuck with
a beautiful home in London.

1197
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:16,878
Only someone who has
never slept under the stars...

1198
01:20:16,878 --> 01:20:19,005
can say something so stupid.

1199
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:22,876
Wow man.

1200
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:27,078
I should learn from you.

1201
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:33,619
I feel like I've spent my life in a box.

1202
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:37,665
But you...

1203
01:20:40,101 --> 01:20:41,591
you are free.

1204
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:47,803
You're free, Laila.

1205
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,011
Arjun...

1206
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:57,986
The only time a man
should be in a box...

1207
01:20:57,986 --> 01:20:59,954
is when he's dead.

1208
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:25,375
Natasha, stay for a few more days.

1209
01:21:25,747 --> 01:21:26,611
You don't mean that.

1210
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:28,243
No, I do.

1211
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:30,147
I don't like it that you're so sad.

1212
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:32,076
What do you expect?

1213
01:21:32,153 --> 01:21:35,850
How would you feel if I just left you
and took off with my friends?

1214
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:38,386
You have your own life.

1215
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:41,485
And if you and Sameera
ever decide to go on a trip...

1216
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:43,458
why would I stop you?

1217
01:21:43,665 --> 01:21:46,902
And if I told you
that we've met some guys...

1218
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,234
and made dinner plans
with them, then?

1219
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:50,602
Then what?

1220
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:51,902
Then what?

1221
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:54,442
I trust you.

1222
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:57,570
Of course I'd want
you both to be safe...

1223
01:21:58,246 --> 01:21:59,645
but besides that,
I won't suspect you.

1224
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:02,046
I'm sorry, but it's easier said than done.

1225
01:22:04,219 --> 01:22:04,878
Babe...

1226
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:08,416
you're welcome to stay
if you want to.

1227
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:11,220
But if you don't,
I'll drive you to the airport tomorrow.

1228
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:15,294
Good night.

1229
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:29,536
- I'll miss you.
- Take care.

1230
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:32,478
- Stay in touch. See at the wedding.

1231
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:34,105
- Imran, can you help me?
- Of course.

1232
01:22:34,182 --> 01:22:35,383
For sure. Okay?

1233
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:37,085
- Email me.
- I will.

1234
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:37,915
Good luck.

1235
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:42,114
Hey...

1236
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:48,957
Yesterday was...

1237
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:54,524
I had the best time yesterday.

1238
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:57,230
Me too.

1239
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:00,942
And good luck...

1240
01:23:00,942 --> 01:23:03,240
for your upcoming adventures.

1241
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:06,575
Thanks.

1242
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:22,330
I'll see you.

1243
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,259
Bye.

1244
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:31,038
Bye.

1245
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:32,370
Ciao.

1246
01:23:56,398 --> 01:23:59,267
A thought came alive, but away it hid

1247
01:23:59,267 --> 01:24:01,997
It stole a glance, from under the eyelids

1248
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:06,302
Sometimes from you, sometimes from me
it asked for words to set it free

1249
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:12,414
Words to wear, so from the lips it can flee

1250
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:15,975
A voice it can embrace and sway with glee

1251
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:20,986
But this thought
Is a feeling... just a feeling

1
00:00:03,431 --> 00:00:05,729
Like a fragrance floating in the breeze

2
00:00:06,434 --> 00:00:08,732
A fragrance that is unspeaking

3
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:12,173
You live with it

4
00:00:12,173 --> 00:00:14,232
I'm aware of it

5
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:16,867
Out in the open for the world to see

6
00:00:16,945 --> 00:00:19,175
What is this unknown mystery?

7
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:05,241
Laila?

8
00:02:13,695 --> 00:02:14,992
You'll forgot something?

9
00:02:35,683 --> 00:02:37,412
I hate regrets.

10
00:02:40,088 --> 00:02:41,555
Then you shouldn't have any.

11
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:00,596
Bye.

12
00:03:20,094 --> 00:03:24,332
Flying away in the open sky...

13
00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:28,632
Are the birds of my dreams

14
00:03:31,372 --> 00:03:34,205
Flying away...

15
00:03:34,943 --> 00:03:39,642
To the land of my heart
are the birds of my dreams

16
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:50,189
Don't know where they'll go nest

17
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:58,392
Wings have taken flight and
now says my sight you've flnally awoken

18
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:04,065
What was on your mind is left behind
You've moved far ahead in time

19
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,033
Life is floating on a breeze

20
00:04:10,712 --> 00:04:15,581
Life is telling you and me

21
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,389
Now whatever will be will be

22
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:06,399
A touch from someone
and I've been wandering without a thought

23
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:12,874
Somewhere new words were spoken
and since then I've been lost

24
00:05:12,874 --> 00:05:17,902
Something made the heart melt

25
00:05:18,613 --> 00:05:23,414
In a blink, I was someone else

26
00:05:26,821 --> 00:05:31,019
Now whatever will be will be

27
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:48,909
A light shone down
Now there's a beauty being showered on the streets

28
00:05:51,846 --> 00:06:00,379
Happiness came down
Now there's a zest being showered upon me

29
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:08,059
Now I flnally know who I was meant to be

30
00:06:11,499 --> 00:06:17,233
Do you remember that moment yesterday
The one with the magic force?

31
00:06:17,305 --> 00:06:23,369
It transformed us into something new
I wonder which moment it was?

32
00:06:23,444 --> 00:06:27,278
The heart says just blindly go to

33
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:33,816
Any place that desire takes you

34
00:06:37,425 --> 00:06:43,421
Now whatever will be will be

35
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,729
What do you mean,
you've quit your job?

36
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:16,464
What do you mean,
you've quit your job?

37
00:07:16,464 --> 00:07:17,698
Meaning?

38
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:19,859
We're getting married in two months.

39
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:22,164
So? You can resume after the wedding.

40
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:24,161
How?

41
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,197
First, we'll go on the honeymoon...

42
00:07:26,274 --> 00:07:28,876
then I want to redo the house.

43
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:31,071
That will take about a year.

44
00:07:31,646 --> 00:07:34,215
And if you're going
to Singapore for your new project...

45
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:36,046
I'll be coming with you.

46
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:39,620
But...

47
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,952
that hotel is your dream project, Natasha.

48
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,814
Dreams change baby.

49
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,829
Then, I didn't know I'd be getting married.

50
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:48,796
Married?

51
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:51,862
What does marriage have to do with it?

52
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:53,868
What do you mean?

53
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:55,495
Obviously, priorities change.

54
00:07:56,337 --> 00:07:59,864
After the wedding, even you wouldn't
want to go on this kind of boys holiday

55
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:14,280
- When is her flight?
- At 6 p.m.

56
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:19,490
Don't worry man, we'll make it.

57
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:21,491
Yeah.

58
00:08:27,268 --> 00:08:28,394
Very funny!

59
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:32,369
All okay, babe?

60
00:08:32,974 --> 00:08:33,702
Yeah.

61
00:08:34,475 --> 00:08:35,669
Can I drive?

62
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,408
Can you drive?

63
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:51,626
Babe, the speed limit is 120.
You can go faster.

64
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:53,787
Yes, we may just miss that flight.

65
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:56,429
I'm not going to drive rashly.

66
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,991
Watch out!

67
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:02,094
Please keep your eyes on the road, please!

68
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,672
Then tell him not to talk to me.

69
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:06,003
Don't talk to her.

70
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:12,338
I love this song.

71
00:09:15,983 --> 00:09:19,510
Rock chick in a hard rock world...

72
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,583
I'm a rock chick in a hard rock world...

73
00:09:29,764 --> 00:09:33,791
Nothing rocks better than a rock chick girl...

74
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:40,904
I'm a rock chick in a hard rock world...

75
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:46,206
I had fun.

76
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,514
Listen...

77
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:55,279
I'm sorry.

78
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,655
Me too.

79
00:09:58,426 --> 00:09:59,654
Bye Bagwati.

80
00:10:10,538 --> 00:10:11,368
Tell me...

81
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,939
what do you think about them?

82
00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:19,870
- Kabir is not himself when Natasha is around.
- That's what I thought.

83
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:21,378
Correct.

84
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,515
I sense some tension.

85
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:27,352
Did you speak with him?

86
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:29,984
Why should I?

87
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,419
If a friend doesn't address
a personal problem, then who will?

88
00:10:35,096 --> 00:10:36,497
Forget it man!

89
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:38,829
They'll sort their problem
and we'll get screwed in the middle.

90
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:39,830
Chee, man!

91
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:42,303
You are seriously shameless.

92
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,167
What?

93
00:10:45,006 --> 00:10:47,375
Look... he is our friend.

94
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,275
When he is back,
let's talk to him.

95
00:10:51,545 --> 00:10:52,341
Okay?

96
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:54,838
Okay.

97
00:11:17,304 --> 00:11:18,032
God!

98
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:19,831
Now what has he done?

99
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:24,001
He's buried inside his diary again.
He's too boring.

100
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:26,072
What do you write in it?

101
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:27,510
It's private.

102
00:11:28,516 --> 00:11:29,448
Rascal...

103
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:31,414
you've always been secretive.

104
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:34,789
- But there's nothing to tell.
- No, no, no!

105
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:37,019
You're obviously struggling
with an emotional problem.

106
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,854
What? Me?

107
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:41,095
Arjun...

108
00:11:41,095 --> 00:11:42,963
I truly believe that...

109
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:46,956
if a friend doesn't address
a personal problem, then who will?

110
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:50,171
- Continue.
- Yes, absolutely.

111
00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:52,571
To figure out the problem
we have to do a test.

112
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,475
- I'll say a word.
- Okay.

113
00:11:54,475 --> 00:11:58,536
And you have to say the first thing
that comes to your mind.

114
00:11:58,612 --> 00:12:00,214
Without deliberating.

115
00:12:00,214 --> 00:12:01,579
- Alright?
- Okay.

116
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:03,310
- Ready, doctor.
- Fine.

117
00:12:03,751 --> 00:12:04,718
Car.

118
00:12:04,952 --> 00:12:05,853
Road.

119
00:12:05,853 --> 00:12:06,820
Arjun.

120
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:07,985
Brother.

121
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:09,019
Diary.

122
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:09,924
Poetry.

123
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:10,791
Heart.

124
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:11,348
Love.

125
00:12:11,425 --> 00:12:12,293
Mumbai.

126
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:13,160
Traffic.

127
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,218
Father.

128
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,997
- Father?
- Mother.

129
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:22,226
According to my test...

130
00:12:22,303 --> 00:12:25,206
your father is the root of
your emotional problem.

131
00:12:25,206 --> 00:12:26,764
And you're keeping this from the world.

132
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:31,712
And, in my opinion,
Dr. Sigmund Fraud...

133
00:12:31,712 --> 00:12:35,409
it's time to shred your degree.
Please stop practicing, please!

134
00:12:35,683 --> 00:12:37,173
You hurt my feelings, man.

135
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:49,425
My bwoys!

136
00:12:50,364 --> 00:12:52,924
If you want a view,
look that way.

137
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:03,537
We should talk to him.

138
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:13,687
Natasha is really sweet.
It was really nice to meet her.

139
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:17,316
Yeah... even she was glad
to have met you.

140
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:21,555
Kabir...

141
00:13:24,031 --> 00:13:26,431
- are you happy?
- Yes.

142
00:13:30,638 --> 00:13:33,471
Why... are you asking like this?

143
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,705
I don't know man. Listen...

144
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,641
it's possible I may be wrong.

145
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,547
But, we are friends.
And I just...

146
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,746
I just have to ask you.

147
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:52,793
Are you happy with Natasha?

148
00:13:54,028 --> 00:13:58,226
Dude, you just met her.
And the poor girl was a bit tense.

149
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:01,559
She thought there was something
between Laila and me.

150
00:14:03,304 --> 00:14:04,202
Yeah.

151
00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:07,965
But, now there's no problem.
Thanks to you, my bwoys!

152
00:14:09,043 --> 00:14:10,271
Okay?

153
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:11,538
She's sweet.

154
00:14:12,046 --> 00:14:13,707
Imran, you've met her.
You spent time with her.

155
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:14,645
Tell him.

156
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:16,346
Yes, she is very sweet.

157
00:14:20,454 --> 00:14:21,689
Well that's good, man.

158
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:22,519
I'm happy for you.

159
00:14:28,295 --> 00:14:29,819
Hey... here's an extra pillow!

160
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:36,162
Good night, bwoys.

161
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:38,531
Good night.

162
00:14:53,354 --> 00:14:56,881
Guys, do you mind
if we take a detour?

163
00:14:57,925 --> 00:14:58,721
Why?

164
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,990
There is an artist, Salman Habib.

165
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:04,331
He lives around here.
The lady at the gallery told me.

166
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:06,390
That he sells his paintings from home.

167
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:08,068
Really?

168
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:10,067
Sounds good.

169
00:15:10,137 --> 00:15:12,435
Anyway, I'm a bit bored
hanging with just the two of you.

170
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,351
The map says we should take
the next right for Grazalema.

171
00:15:33,594 --> 00:15:35,095
- Salman Habib.

172
00:15:35,095 --> 00:15:37,222
- You'll find Indians in
every corner of the world.

173
00:15:37,965 --> 00:15:39,990
- Really, man. We're everywhere!

174
00:15:41,302 --> 00:15:43,099
Grazalema. Turn right over here.

175
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:54,738
- Dude, I said right.
- Forget it.

176
00:15:54,815 --> 00:15:58,352
Don't feel like it.
Let's go to Seville.

177
00:15:58,352 --> 00:16:00,752
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

178
00:16:00,821 --> 00:16:02,789
We can go on the way back.
It's okay.

179
00:16:04,091 --> 00:16:05,058
Okay!

180
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:10,061
It's time to see
what I've planned for us.

181
00:16:15,502 --> 00:16:17,470
Check it out, bwoys!

182
00:16:18,872 --> 00:16:21,170
Look at that guys!

183
00:16:22,343 --> 00:16:25,244
- Arjun, my pal. You rock!
- Look at that dude!

184
00:16:25,312 --> 00:16:26,870
- Wow!
- You b******!

185
00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:29,116
You're purposely doing this.

186
00:16:29,116 --> 00:16:30,818
You know I'm scared of heights.

187
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:32,046
Don't be silly.

188
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:34,177
I want to do this.
It's my dream.

189
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:35,881
- Yeah right!
- Just imagine...

190
00:16:36,657 --> 00:16:39,785
jumping from 15,000 feet
and flying towards the earth.

191
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,887
That's not flying, that's falling.

192
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,797
It will be fun.

193
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:45,187
Relax.

194
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:47,267
Remember he eventually enjoyed diving.

195
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:48,002
- Correct.
- Big deal.

196
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:50,368
With a beautiful instructor
like Laila, who wouldn't!

197
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:52,870
You never know,
you also might get lucky.

198
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:56,610
You people ready to
jump out of a plane?

199
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,599
- Oh yeah!

200
00:16:57,845 --> 00:17:00,405
Are you ready to enter the air?

201
00:17:00,781 --> 00:17:01,770
Yeah!

202
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,521
Head up. Eyes to the horizon.

203
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:09,250
Legs at 45 degrees.

204
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:12,053
Arch! Arch!

205
00:17:15,863 --> 00:17:17,262
- Did I say relax?
- No.

206
00:17:17,831 --> 00:17:21,358
I said arch.
I didn't say relax.

207
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:34,971
These are total malfunctions.

208
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:38,452
In case of a total malfunction
what you have to do is this.

209
00:17:38,452 --> 00:17:40,613
Cut away your main and
deploy your reserve.

210
00:17:41,088 --> 00:17:42,715
What is that?
You have a malfunction.

211
00:17:45,592 --> 00:17:47,828
Cut away my main and
deploy my reserve.

212
00:17:47,828 --> 00:17:49,159
What are you doing?

213
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:52,522
- It's a broken line.
- Are you sure it's a broken line?

214
00:17:53,434 --> 00:17:56,597
Scissor kick... scissor kick...

215
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:58,599
Cut! Deploy!

216
00:17:59,606 --> 00:18:00,470
Perfect!

217
00:18:05,512 --> 00:18:06,171
What's this?

218
00:18:06,613 --> 00:18:07,548
Waiver form.

219
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:08,276
Waiver form?

220
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:11,681
If something happens to us... like death,
these guys aren't responsible.

221
00:18:11,752 --> 00:18:13,320
We are responsible for it.

222
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,048
What?

223
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:18,849
I'll see you outside.

224
00:18:54,628 --> 00:18:56,459
- I'm feeling sick.
- What?

225
00:18:58,098 --> 00:18:59,463
I'm going to throw up.

226
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:04,336
I'm scared too.

227
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:06,630
But that's why we are here.

228
00:19:08,842 --> 00:19:10,400
Everybody get ready.

229
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:11,871
Okay!

230
00:19:20,654 --> 00:19:22,713
Alright, guys. This is it!

231
00:19:43,177 --> 00:19:44,166
Bye!

232
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,208
Dude!

233
00:19:51,685 --> 00:19:52,652
I'm next.

234
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:55,614
Adios amigo!

235
00:19:57,691 --> 00:19:58,885
See you downstairs!

236
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:13,962
Let go, lmran.

237
00:20:16,176 --> 00:20:17,871
Just let it all go!

238
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:49,007
Push me!

239
00:21:45,265 --> 00:21:46,630
Come on, lmran!

240
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,796
Lmran!

241
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,507
Who are you?
Where have you been?

242
00:24:18,151 --> 00:24:20,711
I've moved the heaven and the earth
but I couldn't flnd you

243
00:24:21,955 --> 00:24:25,288
But you arrive today,
so suddenly

244
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:28,885
And you give meaning to
my whole life with your love

245
00:24:29,596 --> 00:24:31,223
I don't understand

246
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:33,426
I don't know

247
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,667
What you've said to me, Señorita

248
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,828
Even then, I have no idea why

249
00:24:41,608 --> 00:24:44,805
I like what I heard, Señorita

250
00:24:55,322 --> 00:24:57,654
Don't look away

251
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:01,520
Stay close to me

252
00:25:03,196 --> 00:25:05,756
Take me in your arms

253
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:09,029
Hope you've understood Señorita

254
00:25:10,036 --> 00:25:13,164
Even a few moments of love

255
00:25:14,774 --> 00:25:17,677
Are never too less

256
00:25:17,677 --> 00:25:20,805
Come let's lose ourselves in them

257
00:25:22,516 --> 00:25:24,848
And forget we ever knew sadness

258
00:25:24,918 --> 00:25:28,718
Señorita, listen to us
Señorita, d'you hear what we're saying

259
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:32,617
I will never understand

260
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,720
The meaning of the words
you dedicate to me

261
00:25:37,264 --> 00:25:40,233
But the warmth of your gaze

262
00:25:41,468 --> 00:25:44,699
Makes me feel like
the most beautiful Señorita

263
00:25:45,105 --> 00:25:49,342
Our eyes looked at each other

264
00:25:49,342 --> 00:25:52,243
And recounted tales of desire Señorita

265
00:25:52,946 --> 00:25:56,746
That for affection and for love

266
00:25:56,983 --> 00:26:01,283
There is only one language
in the world Señorita

267
00:26:01,788 --> 00:26:04,188
Don't look away from me now

268
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:07,820
Come closer to me

269
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:12,262
Take me in your arms

270
00:26:12,699 --> 00:26:16,032
Hope you've understood Señorita

271
00:26:16,102 --> 00:26:19,560
Even a few moments of love

272
00:26:21,107 --> 00:26:23,473
Are never too less

273
00:26:24,044 --> 00:26:27,844
Come let's lose ourselves in them

274
00:26:28,949 --> 00:26:31,318
And forget we ever knew sadness

275
00:26:31,318 --> 00:26:35,687
Señorita, listen to us
Señorita, d'you hear what we're saying

276
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,621
With every moment that has passed

277
00:26:48,635 --> 00:26:50,830
Oh Señorita

278
00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:55,372
You've managed to win my heart

279
00:26:55,775 --> 00:26:57,640
And that's all there is to it

280
00:26:58,345 --> 00:27:00,370
Don't look away

281
00:27:02,282 --> 00:27:04,443
Stay close to me

282
00:27:05,986 --> 00:27:08,352
Take me in your arms

283
00:27:09,322 --> 00:27:12,314
Hope you've understood Señorita

284
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:15,818
Even a few moments of love

285
00:27:17,697 --> 00:27:19,722
Are never too less

286
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,127
Come let's lose ourselves in them

287
00:27:25,505 --> 00:27:27,837
And forget we ever knew sadness

288
00:28:07,313 --> 00:28:10,077
Remember before cable TV
we only had one national channel?

289
00:28:12,318 --> 00:28:14,843
And every Sunday
they showed a Hindi film.

290
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,883
Get to the point.

291
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,383
The point is...

292
00:28:21,261 --> 00:28:23,320
before the film there was this animation.

293
00:28:24,364 --> 00:28:26,855
A white circle went round and round
and formed the channel logo.

294
00:28:29,469 --> 00:28:30,663
Do you remember the tune?

295
00:28:50,857 --> 00:28:51,687
Brilliant!

296
00:29:03,436 --> 00:29:05,734
That tune never failed to depress me.

297
00:29:06,806 --> 00:29:07,795
Depressed.

298
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:11,237
I'm feeling the same right now.

299
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,473
Weekend's over and school begins.

300
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:19,853
- And you wanted to cancel this trip!
- I know, man!

301
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:21,081
Can you imagine?

302
00:29:25,091 --> 00:29:26,217
You know what that means?

303
00:29:27,694 --> 00:29:28,922
It means...

304
00:29:30,096 --> 00:29:32,257
that everything is predestined.

305
00:29:34,934 --> 00:29:35,992
Everything!

306
00:29:37,103 --> 00:29:40,561
This holiday was in our destiny.

307
00:29:41,775 --> 00:29:42,742
You know!

308
00:29:45,545 --> 00:29:47,342
You, me and asshole.

309
00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:50,309
- Cheers asshole.
- Where's asshole?

310
00:29:52,452 --> 00:29:52,975
Cheers!

311
00:29:55,855 --> 00:29:57,345
Laila too.

312
00:30:01,427 --> 00:30:03,554
I was meant to meet her.

313
00:30:04,864 --> 00:30:06,229
You are in louw, my bwoy.

314
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:08,159
No, man!

315
00:30:08,668 --> 00:30:10,033
You are in louw...

316
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,038
- You are in louw...

317
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:14,905
- You are in louw...
- Kabir, man!

318
00:30:14,974 --> 00:30:17,340
Everything is written.
Listen to me.

319
00:30:17,544 --> 00:30:19,034
It's all predestined.

320
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,113
You know what I'm saying?

321
00:30:20,113 --> 00:30:22,282
This moment... us right now...

322
00:30:22,282 --> 00:30:23,750
it's predestined.

323
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,308
Predestined.

324
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:28,110
Please stop saying, 'predestined... '!

325
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:29,945
I beg of you!

326
00:30:30,423 --> 00:30:32,959
This too is predestined.
It's all written.

327
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,961
Alright, we get it.

328
00:30:34,961 --> 00:30:36,861
Listen, we get it, zip!

329
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,090
Come on, man!

330
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:40,766
It's true.

331
00:30:41,868 --> 00:30:43,036
It's predestined...

332
00:30:43,036 --> 00:30:43,934
Guys...

333
00:30:55,615 --> 00:30:56,479
Hola...

334
00:31:08,928 --> 00:31:10,418
Guys, watch out!

335
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:14,257
What the hell, guys?

336
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:21,936
Yes?

337
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:40,360
- Our man is back.
- Their mobiles are switched off.

338
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,349
- What?
- Yup.

339
00:31:41,427 --> 00:31:42,528
Even Nuria's?

340
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:44,086
Yes, I'm shocked.

341
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:47,223
When she knew we'd land up in jail,
she should've kept the phone switched on

342
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:50,603
If our bail isn't posted...

343
00:31:50,603 --> 00:31:53,128
we'll be stuck here for days.

344
00:31:57,777 --> 00:31:58,641
Arjun...

345
00:32:00,313 --> 00:32:02,110
tell them I want to make a call.

346
00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:04,275
To whom?

347
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:06,579
Salman Habib.

348
00:32:07,086 --> 00:32:08,110
The artist?

349
00:32:09,956 --> 00:32:10,650
Yeah.

350
00:32:12,025 --> 00:32:13,822
Why will he come to post our bail?

351
00:32:15,595 --> 00:32:16,755
Are you alright?

352
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,033
Just because we can't reach anyone,
he's losing it.

353
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:21,091
He's my father.

354
00:32:21,968 --> 00:32:22,662
What?

355
00:32:25,138 --> 00:32:26,264
I am his son.

356
00:32:36,616 --> 00:32:37,810
Just let it go lmran.

357
00:32:40,486 --> 00:32:41,544
Just let it go.

358
00:32:42,121 --> 00:32:42,780
- Hello...

359
00:32:44,157 --> 00:32:45,525
Hello, may I...

360
00:32:45,525 --> 00:32:47,686
speak with Mr. Salman Habib, please?

361
00:32:48,428 --> 00:32:49,156
- Yes?

362
00:32:50,797 --> 00:32:52,526
Sir, I am lmran.

363
00:32:54,467 --> 00:32:56,958
I am Rahila's son.

364
00:33:01,274 --> 00:33:02,741
When did you find out?

365
00:33:06,045 --> 00:33:07,945
Afew days after Abu died.

366
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:14,208
In his stuff, I found a letter
that Ammi had written to him.

367
00:33:15,655 --> 00:33:17,384
The letter stated that...

368
00:33:17,457 --> 00:33:23,157
Ammi was grateful that Abu had
accepted her and her unborn child.

369
00:33:26,499 --> 00:33:28,057
Why didn't you tell us?

370
00:33:31,104 --> 00:33:32,435
I was a bit shaken up.

371
00:33:34,173 --> 00:33:36,698
What would I tell you?
Abu is not my father.

372
00:33:39,345 --> 00:33:41,313
He loved you a lot.

373
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:44,476
He really loved you.

374
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:47,750
And us.

375
00:33:48,454 --> 00:33:50,456
I mean, think about it.

376
00:33:50,456 --> 00:33:52,992
Be it sports day or
parent-teacher meetings...

377
00:33:52,992 --> 00:33:56,325
our fathers seldom came,
but Abu was always there.

378
00:33:57,964 --> 00:34:00,159
Well, my father was dead.

379
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:03,999
So, if he showed up for sports day
it would've been a bit strange.

380
00:34:10,943 --> 00:34:12,342
- You've got bail.

381
00:34:15,615 --> 00:34:16,912
They're here.

382
00:34:28,628 --> 00:34:29,492
Hi.

383
00:34:32,532 --> 00:34:33,328
Imran.

384
00:34:35,535 --> 00:34:36,502
Imran...

385
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,634
I'm Salman.

386
00:34:43,309 --> 00:34:45,378
My friends, Arjun and Kabir.

387
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:46,572
- Hello.
- Thank you.

388
00:34:46,646 --> 00:34:47,943
Hi... thank you.

389
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:50,872
You three look pretty hungover.

390
00:34:54,187 --> 00:34:56,985
You're welcome to come over to
my place and freshen up.

391
00:34:57,657 --> 00:35:00,387
Our bags and car are at the hotel.

392
00:35:00,593 --> 00:35:01,992
I'll drive you there.

393
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,524
Come.

394
00:35:19,512 --> 00:35:21,537
- Wow, this is beautiful.

395
00:35:23,282 --> 00:35:24,306
It's really nice.

396
00:35:25,518 --> 00:35:27,713
Are you always so polite?

397
00:35:29,188 --> 00:35:32,487
It's absolute rubbish.
Anyone can do that.

398
00:35:33,292 --> 00:35:35,795
This gentleman, my neighbour...

399
00:35:35,795 --> 00:35:38,998
was obsessed with having his wife
immortalised in a potrait.

400
00:35:38,998 --> 00:35:42,525
So, I applied my brush
and fulfilled his desire.

401
00:35:42,602 --> 00:35:44,934
And with his money, paid my bills.

402
00:35:47,306 --> 00:35:49,638
So, what are you guys doing in Seville?

403
00:35:50,343 --> 00:35:51,711
Skydiving.

404
00:35:51,711 --> 00:35:52,871
- Really?
- Yeah.

405
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:55,072
So, you jumped out of a plane
and landed in jail?

406
00:35:56,349 --> 00:35:57,714
You could say that.

407
00:35:58,184 --> 00:36:02,314
That apart, what do you do?

408
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:04,916
Well, I'm a financial broker.

409
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:06,258
In London.

410
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:07,817
Money man.

411
00:36:09,262 --> 00:36:09,990
And you?

412
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,325
My family is in the construction business.

413
00:36:13,366 --> 00:36:15,732
Well, never mind.
Everyone makes mistakes.

414
00:36:16,702 --> 00:36:17,498
That's funny.

415
00:36:18,137 --> 00:36:20,128
You're a Xerox copy of him.

416
00:36:23,843 --> 00:36:25,538
And, what about you?

417
00:36:26,946 --> 00:36:27,844
I write.

418
00:36:29,515 --> 00:36:30,072
What?

419
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,679
I'm a copywriter in advertising.

420
00:36:33,753 --> 00:36:36,813
Writing copy for ads is like
a buffet for the masses.

421
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,886
For instance, this painting is
for someone else.

422
00:36:41,327 --> 00:36:44,125
Do you write anything
to feed your own soul?

423
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:47,162
I do.

424
00:36:51,971 --> 00:36:52,460
Sir?

425
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:53,668
Salman.

426
00:36:54,373 --> 00:36:56,102
Right. We'll be outside.

427
00:37:13,593 --> 00:37:16,756
Your hands are very similar to mine.

428
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:21,133
Sit.

429
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,768
Do you live alone?

430
00:37:26,272 --> 00:37:27,239
No.

431
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,804
I have a wife.

432
00:37:29,175 --> 00:37:31,302
But she is away... in Paris.

433
00:37:31,811 --> 00:37:32,505
Sit.

434
00:37:35,615 --> 00:37:36,547
And any...

435
00:37:36,782 --> 00:37:37,942
children?

436
00:37:44,523 --> 00:37:45,751
Do you ever come to India?

437
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:47,860
Yes.

438
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,727
I was there four years ago
when my mother passed away.

439
00:37:52,098 --> 00:37:53,799
- Sorry.
- I have a brother there...

440
00:37:53,799 --> 00:37:54,766
but...

441
00:37:56,369 --> 00:37:57,666
we don't meet.

442
00:38:03,276 --> 00:38:05,642
I've often thought about you.

443
00:38:07,613 --> 00:38:08,637
I mean...

444
00:38:10,116 --> 00:38:14,576
that someday, somewhere we might meet.

445
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:18,691
But I never figured...

446
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:21,251
what I would say to you.

447
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:24,088
Just say the truth.

448
00:38:26,866 --> 00:38:29,061
The truth... what is the truth?

449
00:38:30,303 --> 00:38:32,863
Everyone has their own version.

450
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:40,379
Look... I was...

451
00:38:40,379 --> 00:38:42,244
25 then.

452
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:46,385
Rahila was a few years younger.

453
00:38:47,787 --> 00:38:50,523
When you're young
the future doesn't matter.

454
00:38:50,523 --> 00:38:52,150
We were just kids.

455
00:38:54,794 --> 00:38:56,853
One day...

456
00:38:56,929 --> 00:38:59,420
Rahila told me that she's...

457
00:39:00,032 --> 00:39:02,899
expecting a baby.

458
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:05,869
I wasrt ready for
the responsibility then.

459
00:39:05,938 --> 00:39:07,838
And nor am I now.

460
00:39:14,347 --> 00:39:17,282
So... you just abandoned her?

461
00:39:21,153 --> 00:39:24,145
I guess, you could say that.

462
00:39:29,328 --> 00:39:33,856
Rahila wanted a family,
she wanted to be a mother.

463
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,795
I had other dreams.
I wanted to be an artist.

464
00:39:38,804 --> 00:39:40,806
I wanted to paint...

465
00:39:40,806 --> 00:39:42,273
travel the world.

466
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:46,212
I loved her but...

467
00:39:46,212 --> 00:39:49,238
she made her choice
and I made mine.

468
00:39:49,315 --> 00:39:51,112
That's all.

469
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,250
I found out about you
only last year.

470
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:02,160
But...

471
00:40:03,863 --> 00:40:06,491
you've always known about me.

472
00:40:08,334 --> 00:40:10,996
Did you never want to see me?

473
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:15,039
I thought it was better this way.

474
00:40:23,015 --> 00:40:25,506
You asked for the truth.

475
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:28,045
Well, this is it.

476
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,155
I... am sorry, lmran.

477
00:40:34,093 --> 00:40:35,117
No, you're not.

478
00:40:40,032 --> 00:40:42,432
Is there something
I can do for you?

479
00:40:44,003 --> 00:40:46,995
Apologise only when it comes from here.

480
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:13,231
When clouds of pain loom in the sky

481
00:41:13,933 --> 00:41:16,902
When a shadow of sadness flickers by

482
00:41:17,703 --> 00:41:20,672
When a tear flnds it's way to the eye

483
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,009
When fear keeps the loneliness alive

484
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:29,648
I try and console my heart
Why is it that you cry? I ask

485
00:41:29,648 --> 00:41:32,173
This is only what life imparts

486
00:41:32,918 --> 00:41:35,318
These deep silences within

487
00:41:35,821 --> 00:41:38,449
Have been handed out to all by time

488
00:41:39,692 --> 00:41:42,183
Everyone's story has a little sorrow

489
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:45,423
Everyone's share has a little Sunshine

490
00:41:46,799 --> 00:41:48,858
No need for water in your eyes

491
00:41:50,269 --> 00:41:52,567
Every moment can be a new life

492
00:41:53,973 --> 00:41:56,168
Why do you let them pass you by

493
00:41:57,643 --> 00:41:59,611
Oh heart, why is it that you cry?

494
00:42:08,854 --> 00:42:10,014
Morning...

495
00:42:16,262 --> 00:42:17,286
Did you sleep or not?

496
00:42:18,931 --> 00:42:19,659
No.

497
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:31,469
I think, we should get going.

498
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:34,167
Let's go.

499
00:42:35,614 --> 00:42:36,239
Arjun...

500
00:42:40,419 --> 00:42:42,250
I'm really sorry.

501
00:43:07,146 --> 00:43:08,204
I'll see you at the car.

502
00:43:08,447 --> 00:43:09,277
Yeah.

503
00:43:13,419 --> 00:43:15,319
What do you mean,
'you slept in the car'?

504
00:43:16,088 --> 00:43:17,385
Long story, babe.

505
00:43:18,457 --> 00:43:19,481
Tell me, what happened?

506
00:43:20,759 --> 00:43:22,727
Well, lmran just...

507
00:43:24,663 --> 00:43:25,823
I'll tell you later, okay.

508
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:28,428
Why? Tell me now,
what happened?

509
00:43:28,767 --> 00:43:31,736
I can't tell you right now.
I'll tell you when I'm back.

510
00:43:32,104 --> 00:43:33,571
Why are you getting irritated?

511
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,704
Why are you going on about it?

512
00:43:35,941 --> 00:43:37,238
Okay, forget it.

513
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,612
See.

514
00:43:42,982 --> 00:43:44,609
It's our wedding card.
Can you see it?

515
00:43:45,017 --> 00:43:46,416
Isn't it gorgeous?

516
00:43:46,952 --> 00:43:48,579
I'm just so happy with it.

517
00:43:49,421 --> 00:43:52,024
Oh... I've emailed a few options
for your suit.

518
00:43:52,024 --> 00:43:54,720
Please select one. Okay?
Don't forget.

519
00:43:55,194 --> 00:43:56,092
Okay.

520
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,525
You are so far away.

521
00:44:01,834 --> 00:44:03,301
You love me, right?

522
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:05,637
Yeah.

523
00:44:06,338 --> 00:44:08,203
Then stop fighting with me.

524
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:12,169
Everything was fine before you
went on this holiday.

525
00:44:12,845 --> 00:44:14,642
Kabir, just come home.

526
00:44:15,147 --> 00:44:18,583
To me, your family, your friends.

527
00:44:18,984 --> 00:44:20,781
My friends are with me.

528
00:44:21,086 --> 00:44:23,054
Yeah, I know.
But you know what I mean.

529
00:44:34,633 --> 00:44:41,539
Happy birthday to you...

530
00:44:42,508 --> 00:44:46,137
Happy birthday dear Anjali...

531
00:44:46,812 --> 00:44:49,337
Happy birthday to you...

532
00:44:55,988 --> 00:44:56,886
Oh my God!

533
00:44:57,923 --> 00:44:59,117
It's beautiful!

534
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:00,549
- Nice, right?
- Yes!

535
00:45:02,661 --> 00:45:03,525
Tanya?

536
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:14,832
What are you doing, baby?

537
00:45:15,441 --> 00:45:16,840
I'm sorry, I'm so happy.

538
00:45:17,309 --> 00:45:19,539
Kabir just proposed to Natasha.

539
00:45:19,611 --> 00:45:20,846
- What??

540
00:45:20,846 --> 00:45:22,848
Oh my God!

541
00:45:22,848 --> 00:45:25,517
You could've waited until
your mother had cut the cake.

542
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:28,509
Kabir, this is the best birthday gift, ever!

543
00:45:28,587 --> 00:45:29,688
I love you, son.

544
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:30,746
- The shy guy!

545
00:45:31,423 --> 00:45:33,525
- It's a double celebration.

546
00:45:33,525 --> 00:45:34,992
I'm so happy.

547
00:45:35,761 --> 00:45:36,750
Now you have to call me 'mummy'.

548
00:45:38,263 --> 00:45:40,128
- Get some champagne!

549
00:45:42,835 --> 00:45:43,324
Come here.

550
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:47,237
Very good decision.

551
00:45:49,475 --> 00:45:51,443
I'm so happy.

552
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:55,236
Babe, what just happened in there?

553
00:45:55,314 --> 00:45:57,612
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

554
00:45:58,117 --> 00:45:59,852
This ring...

555
00:45:59,852 --> 00:46:01,251
I got it for my mom.

556
00:46:03,255 --> 00:46:05,052
It's her birthday gift.

557
00:46:05,657 --> 00:46:06,715
This is for your mom?

558
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,226
Look at it sweety...
it's a mummy ring.

559
00:46:10,295 --> 00:46:11,697
What?

560
00:46:11,697 --> 00:46:13,062
Why didn't you say something?

561
00:46:13,532 --> 00:46:15,056
I tried.

562
00:46:15,134 --> 00:46:19,036
But you were excited and screaming.
And Tanya made an announcement.

563
00:46:19,705 --> 00:46:21,866
So you don't want to marry me?

564
00:46:22,307 --> 00:46:25,834
It's not about you.
I haven't even thought about marriage.

565
00:46:28,514 --> 00:46:30,311
What do I tell my father?

566
00:46:35,287 --> 00:46:38,190
We'll say that
we gave it some more thought and...

567
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:40,590
we need more time.
That's all.

568
00:46:40,659 --> 00:46:42,286
This is so embarrassing.

569
00:46:43,128 --> 00:46:45,187
I'm so sorry, sweety.

570
00:46:46,131 --> 00:46:48,827
You don't ever want to marry me?

571
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:51,937
It's not like that.

572
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:54,462
If it is, you better tell me right now!

573
00:46:55,774 --> 00:46:58,477
I really love you, Kabir.
And I don't...

574
00:46:58,477 --> 00:47:01,708
No, no... no sweety.
Don't cry.

575
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,712
Not now.

576
00:47:10,088 --> 00:47:10,816
Kabir...

577
00:47:12,758 --> 00:47:16,455
are you even serious
about this relationship or not?

578
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:20,628
You know what...

579
00:47:31,677 --> 00:47:32,701
Will you marry me?

580
00:47:56,835 --> 00:47:57,893
Who is it?

581
00:48:12,784 --> 00:48:13,648
Room service.

582
00:48:14,853 --> 00:48:15,478
Laila?

583
00:48:16,521 --> 00:48:17,545
Hi!

584
00:48:17,623 --> 00:48:18,453
Oh my God!

585
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:21,325
You're here... how... I mean...

586
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,456
Imran called and
he begged me to come.

587
00:48:24,796 --> 00:48:25,990
- So I came.
- Imran?

588
00:48:26,465 --> 00:48:27,489
I knew it.

589
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:29,724
He is my best friend.

590
00:48:32,871 --> 00:48:35,032
I am... so glad you're here.

591
00:48:36,475 --> 00:48:38,136
I'm glad you are glad.

592
00:48:40,812 --> 00:48:42,973
Hello... my the two the love the birds!

593
00:48:43,448 --> 00:48:44,779
Hello!

594
00:48:44,917 --> 00:48:45,975
Surprised, Arjun?

595
00:48:47,286 --> 00:48:48,344
Thank you.

596
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:49,821
It's good to see you.

597
00:48:49,821 --> 00:48:51,015
- And you.
- Hey gorgeous.

598
00:48:51,089 --> 00:48:53,158
- I love you too.
- Nice to have you back.

599
00:48:53,158 --> 00:48:54,523
You got a tan!

600
00:48:55,294 --> 00:48:56,295
Get dressed, soon!

601
00:48:56,295 --> 00:48:57,629
- We had to leave at seven.
- Correct.

602
00:48:57,629 --> 00:48:58,830
- Two minutes?
- You missed me?

603
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:00,499
I always miss you, darling.

604
00:49:00,499 --> 00:49:01,523
Where are we going?

605
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,227
It's a surprise.
Can't tell you in front of him.

606
00:49:21,286 --> 00:49:22,446
What's going on?

607
00:49:22,854 --> 00:49:23,912
What do you mean?

608
00:49:24,156 --> 00:49:25,214
It's San Fermin.

609
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:26,325
Running with the bulls.

610
00:49:26,325 --> 00:49:27,724
- Really?
- Didrt you know?

611
00:49:27,793 --> 00:49:28,919
Just follow me...

612
00:49:37,202 --> 00:49:38,260
Holy shit!

613
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:46,937
Are these guys mad?
What are they doing?

614
00:49:47,179 --> 00:49:47,975
Suicide.

615
00:49:48,513 --> 00:49:49,878
Isn't that why you are here?

616
00:50:00,592 --> 00:50:02,651
I felt this should be the
last experience of our trip.

617
00:50:03,362 --> 00:50:05,830
This could be the
last experience of our life!

618
00:50:06,164 --> 00:50:08,333
Stop it, Arjun.
Let's grab a bite.

619
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:08,890
Come on.

620
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:11,036
- Excuse me.
- Dude are you...

621
00:50:11,036 --> 00:50:12,264
- I'm starving!

622
00:50:13,872 --> 00:50:15,362
This is not an adventure sport.

623
00:50:16,041 --> 00:50:17,338
I object, Judge sahab!

624
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:20,145
I agree it's not as safe as regular sports.

625
00:50:20,145 --> 00:50:21,713
And is illegal in some countries.

626
00:50:21,713 --> 00:50:24,511
But according to the
Spanish tradition and culture...

627
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:25,517
it is allowed.

628
00:50:25,517 --> 00:50:27,508
And technically,
according to our deal...

629
00:50:27,586 --> 00:50:29,986
we can choose any sport, remember?

630
00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:31,823
Lmran, it's really dangerous, you know.

631
00:50:31,823 --> 00:50:34,018
Yes, those bulls could kill us, alright?

632
00:50:34,259 --> 00:50:36,928
We'll be dangling on their horns
like tandoori chicken on skewers!

633
00:50:36,928 --> 00:50:38,657
Precisely the point.

634
00:50:39,798 --> 00:50:41,857
You want to get rid of
the fear within you?

635
00:50:42,134 --> 00:50:44,295
Well then, here's
our deepest fear. Death.

636
00:50:45,337 --> 00:50:46,361
Let's face it.

637
00:50:46,972 --> 00:50:48,340
Because beyond this fear...

638
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:49,238
lies victory!

639
00:50:49,307 --> 00:50:51,332
Please spare us the tag lines!

640
00:50:51,777 --> 00:50:53,472
Dude, think about it!

641
00:50:53,712 --> 00:50:57,341
No training, no instructors.
Just us, my amigos!

642
00:50:58,083 --> 00:50:59,880
And some bulls running after us.

643
00:51:00,118 --> 00:51:02,416
If you want to live... just run!

644
00:51:02,821 --> 00:51:04,982
Laila, do you know
any psychiatrist around here?

645
00:51:05,757 --> 00:51:07,987
Because our amigo has
completely lost it!

646
00:51:08,827 --> 00:51:10,852
I'll be at the starting line
at seven tomorrow morning.

647
00:51:11,496 --> 00:51:13,464
With or without you.

648
00:51:19,004 --> 00:51:19,404
I have something for you, lmran.

649
00:51:19,404 --> 00:51:20,393
I have something for you, lmran.

650
00:51:21,273 --> 00:51:22,103
It's from Nuria.

651
00:51:25,877 --> 00:51:26,673
It's in Spanish.

652
00:51:27,646 --> 00:51:28,908
Love has no language.

653
00:51:29,514 --> 00:51:30,208
So true.

654
00:51:33,251 --> 00:51:34,582
I think you should
buy her something.

655
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,250
You're absolutely right.

656
00:51:36,822 --> 00:51:38,380
Guys... next stop - shopping.

657
00:51:39,825 --> 00:51:41,383
Count me out,
I'm going back to the hotel.

658
00:51:42,461 --> 00:51:43,587
Are you alright?

659
00:51:45,964 --> 00:51:46,794
I'm fine.

660
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:49,634
That we'll only know after a test.

661
00:51:50,502 --> 00:51:51,298
Test?

662
00:51:52,537 --> 00:51:53,765
What do you say, Dr. Fraud?

663
00:51:54,673 --> 00:51:55,367
Are you game?

664
00:51:55,974 --> 00:51:56,702
Bring it on.

665
00:51:57,375 --> 00:51:58,569
You have to say the first thing...

666
00:51:58,643 --> 00:52:00,611
I know the drill. Ask!

667
00:52:01,513 --> 00:52:02,241
Black.

668
00:52:02,481 --> 00:52:03,038
Night.

669
00:52:03,115 --> 00:52:03,979
Sea.

670
00:52:04,149 --> 00:52:04,877
Salty.

671
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:05,784
Work.

672
00:52:05,784 --> 00:52:06,785
Money.

673
00:52:06,785 --> 00:52:07,649
Sex.

674
00:52:07,853 --> 00:52:08,687
I like!

675
00:52:08,687 --> 00:52:09,210
Friend.

676
00:52:09,588 --> 00:52:10,316
You.

677
00:52:10,522 --> 00:52:11,489
Marriage.

678
00:52:12,824 --> 00:52:13,984
Family.

679
00:52:20,832 --> 00:52:21,662
What?

680
00:52:23,468 --> 00:52:24,970
Is that all?

681
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:26,267
It was enough.

682
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,808
Smartass...

683
00:52:29,808 --> 00:52:33,505
You're using my trick on me?
Just say what you want to.

684
00:52:34,045 --> 00:52:34,943
Okay.

685
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,080
You hesitated on 'marriage'.

686
00:52:38,517 --> 00:52:39,916
So?

687
00:52:39,985 --> 00:52:43,443
I'm just saying...
you hesitated... on marriage.

688
00:52:47,425 --> 00:52:48,289
Look...

689
00:52:49,294 --> 00:52:52,821
I don't have the time for this crap.
See you later.

690
00:52:56,601 --> 00:52:59,229
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, I'm going to...

691
00:53:07,145 --> 00:53:08,112
Kabir.

692
00:53:13,251 --> 00:53:14,047
Go!

693
00:53:16,955 --> 00:53:18,081
Kabir!

694
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:20,557
Kabir... man, just stop!

695
00:53:21,259 --> 00:53:22,385
What?

696
00:53:23,495 --> 00:53:25,360
Talk to us man.
What's going on?

697
00:53:25,764 --> 00:53:27,629
It's nothing, really.

698
00:53:29,601 --> 00:53:30,568
Kabir...

699
00:53:32,537 --> 00:53:34,835
Look, I'm sorry I lost my cool.

700
00:53:36,141 --> 00:53:38,473
Because I said you have
a problem with marriage?

701
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:42,609
I guess, I'm freaking out.
I don't know what's happening.

702
00:53:43,014 --> 00:53:45,350
It's normal to be nervous.

703
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:47,852
It's not like you're having
an arranged marriage.

704
00:53:47,852 --> 00:53:50,514
Yeah, but she isn't
the same person I met.

705
00:53:51,189 --> 00:53:53,350
She's changed,
she's become possessive.

706
00:53:53,959 --> 00:53:57,258
The girl I knew was a
talented, independent interior designer.

707
00:53:57,429 --> 00:53:59,464
She enjoyed her work.

708
00:53:59,464 --> 00:54:00,431
But now...

709
00:54:00,999 --> 00:54:02,967
she's bid adieu to her passion and...

710
00:54:03,201 --> 00:54:05,101
taken over my life.

711
00:54:06,037 --> 00:54:08,039
Of course, I want a partner but...

712
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:09,734
I want my own life too!

713
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:13,841
The whole two bodies, one soul thing
I won't be able to handle it.

714
00:54:24,522 --> 00:54:26,513
- May I ask you something?
- Yes.

715
00:54:27,826 --> 00:54:30,056
Don't you think
you proposed to her too soon?

716
00:54:30,795 --> 00:54:32,964
Actually, I didn't even propose.

717
00:54:32,964 --> 00:54:34,532
- What?

718
00:54:34,532 --> 00:54:36,864
I'd bought a ring for my mom
as a birthday gift.

719
00:54:37,135 --> 00:54:40,536
Before giving it, I happened to show
it to Natasha and she thought...

720
00:54:40,972 --> 00:54:42,439
it was meant for her.

721
00:54:44,209 --> 00:54:45,904
- Are you crazy?
- What are you doing?

722
00:54:46,378 --> 00:54:48,175
- What's wrong with him?
- What's wrong with him?

723
00:54:53,485 --> 00:54:55,851
No wonder this vacation was
so important for you.

724
00:54:56,588 --> 00:54:57,247
Meaning?

725
00:54:58,356 --> 00:55:01,587
Basically, you wanted to hear from someone else
that you shouldn't get married

726
00:55:01,793 --> 00:55:04,496
And besides us,
who would've told you this.

727
00:55:04,496 --> 00:55:06,364
Have you totally lost it?

728
00:55:06,364 --> 00:55:09,026
The invites are printed.
This isn't the time to overreact!

729
00:55:10,001 --> 00:55:10,968
Kabir.

730
00:55:12,504 --> 00:55:14,165
We know Natasha is a great girl.

731
00:55:14,439 --> 00:55:16,407
And we know you like her.

732
00:55:16,941 --> 00:55:18,431
And of course,
you don't want to hurt her.

733
00:55:19,477 --> 00:55:22,446
But ask yourself...
Do you really want to marry her?

734
00:55:23,181 --> 00:55:24,842
And if not, be honest.

735
00:55:24,916 --> 00:55:26,406
To yourself and to her.

736
00:55:27,118 --> 00:55:30,019
Of course, she'll be hurt.
But in the long run its best for both of you.

737
00:55:30,188 --> 00:55:31,815
He is absolutely right, Kabir.

738
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:33,887
But I've made a commitment.

739
00:55:34,259 --> 00:55:35,994
Okay, you screwed up.

740
00:55:35,994 --> 00:55:38,019
No one's going to send you to prison.

741
00:55:38,096 --> 00:55:40,656
It's not that simple.
Our parents are involved.

742
00:55:40,865 --> 00:55:41,695
Parents?

743
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:43,259
Dude, it's your life.

744
00:55:46,338 --> 00:55:47,669
You won't get it.

745
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,670
Just...

746
00:55:50,342 --> 00:55:52,503
Just let it be, okay?
I'm sorry.

747
00:55:53,345 --> 00:55:54,471
Kabir...

748
00:55:58,249 --> 00:55:59,216
What a guy!

749
00:56:17,469 --> 00:56:18,493
Laila?

750
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,464
Why're you shouting?

751
00:56:24,542 --> 00:56:26,169
Why are you so far?

752
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:41,356
Better?

753
00:56:42,694 --> 00:56:43,524
Best.

754
00:56:46,598 --> 00:56:47,326
Ammi?

755
00:56:48,466 --> 00:56:49,933
How are you?

756
00:56:52,837 --> 00:56:54,805
I met Salman.

757
00:57:01,179 --> 00:57:04,205
I now know why you and Abu
kept this from me.

758
00:57:07,819 --> 00:57:08,877
I'm sorry, Ammi.

759
00:57:11,823 --> 00:57:12,881
- I love you.

760
00:57:14,659 --> 00:57:16,183
I love you too, my boy.

761
00:57:52,497 --> 00:57:55,955
It took a while but

762
00:58:00,872 --> 00:58:05,275
I've now learnt to live

763
00:58:09,747 --> 00:58:13,444
Without the consolation of tears

764
00:58:18,122 --> 00:58:22,786
I've now learnt to live

765
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:49,354
There is someone who brought to mind

766
00:58:49,354 --> 00:58:53,916
How I had gotten left behind

767
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:01,326
Life is like a caravan

768
00:59:02,467 --> 00:59:06,426
Why are you lonely, my man

769
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:13,300
Just know that we are all here

770
00:59:36,501 --> 00:59:39,561
The first rocket indicates that
the pen gates have been opened.

771
00:59:39,971 --> 00:59:42,439
Second rocket indicates that
the bulls are coming towards us.

772
00:59:42,774 --> 00:59:44,475
We run at the second rocket.

773
00:59:44,475 --> 00:59:45,339
Second rocket.

774
00:59:46,978 --> 00:59:48,536
Oh San Fermin, please protect us.

775
00:59:50,481 --> 00:59:51,812
If I die...

776
00:59:52,183 --> 00:59:53,912
my spirit will come back to haunt you.

777
00:59:54,352 --> 00:59:55,876
Why are you thinking about death?

778
00:59:55,954 --> 00:59:57,922
Think about what you'll do
if you survive.

779
01:00:02,493 --> 01:00:02,982
Listen...

780
01:00:03,661 --> 01:00:04,559
a new pact.

781
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:07,125
An if-l-get out-alive pact.

782
01:00:08,299 --> 01:00:10,859
If I get out alive,
I'll let you read my poetry.

783
01:00:12,036 --> 01:00:13,538
Why just you? I'll just...

784
01:00:13,538 --> 01:00:14,732
get it published.

785
01:00:15,607 --> 01:00:16,574
You write poetry?

786
01:00:16,808 --> 01:00:17,638
Yes.

787
01:00:19,444 --> 01:00:20,411
Okay.

788
01:00:20,712 --> 01:00:22,543
If I get out alive...

789
01:00:25,617 --> 01:00:26,311
Okay!

790
01:00:26,784 --> 01:00:28,620
If I get out alive...

791
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,655
I'll go to Morocco with Laila.

792
01:00:30,655 --> 01:00:31,485
Yeah!

793
01:00:31,823 --> 01:00:32,847
That's what I'll do.

794
01:00:33,257 --> 01:00:35,426
What's the worst that could happen?
I'll get fired.

795
01:00:35,426 --> 01:00:36,427
- Right?
- Yeah.

796
01:00:36,427 --> 01:00:37,629
Who cares man?

797
01:00:37,629 --> 01:00:38,823
I'll be with her and I will live.

798
01:00:39,197 --> 01:00:40,357
Well done, my bro!

799
01:00:41,366 --> 01:00:42,196
Come on, Kabir.

800
01:00:44,602 --> 01:00:45,269
Okay.

801
01:00:45,269 --> 01:00:46,964
If I get out alive...

802
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:52,667
Shit guys!
The gates are open!

803
01:00:53,011 --> 01:00:54,069
Kabir just say it.

804
01:00:54,145 --> 01:00:55,840
It's okay, just say it.

805
01:01:03,121 --> 01:01:05,957
If I get out alive,
I'll go to London...

806
01:01:05,957 --> 01:01:07,686
and tell Natasha that...

807
01:01:17,502 --> 01:01:18,901
Say what?
Just say it!

808
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:20,398
Come on, Kabir!

809
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:26,275
- Come on, Kabir!
- Come on!

810
01:01:26,344 --> 01:01:28,938
I'm sorry but I can't marry you.

811
01:01:31,149 --> 01:01:31,816
- Congratulations!
- Look out!

812
01:01:31,816 --> 01:01:33,044
- Congratulations!
- Look out!

813
01:04:15,613 --> 01:04:18,316
If you're carrying
your restlessness in your heart

814
01:04:18,316 --> 01:04:20,375
You are alive

815
01:04:20,451 --> 01:04:23,011
If you're carrying
the lightning of dreams in your eyes

816
01:04:23,087 --> 01:04:24,281
You are alive

817
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:28,582
Like a gust of wind,
learn to live free

818
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:32,229
Learn to flow like
the waves that make a sea

819
01:04:32,864 --> 01:04:35,992
Let your arms be wide open,
to every moment you meet

820
01:04:36,701 --> 01:04:40,193
May every moment gift you
a new sight to greet

821
01:04:40,805 --> 01:04:43,205
If you're carrying
your wonder in your eyes

822
01:04:43,274 --> 01:04:45,139
You are alive

823
01:04:45,843 --> 01:04:48,937
If you're carrying
your restlessness in your heart

824
01:04:49,947 --> 01:04:51,073
You are alive

825
01:05:01,492 --> 01:05:01,525
In the arms of the sun now life will be

826
01:05:01,525 --> 01:05:05,363
In the arms of the sun now life will be

827
01:05:05,363 --> 01:05:09,094
With the rays in our breath
And a shine when we speak

828
01:05:09,166 --> 01:05:13,068
In the arms of the sun now life will be

829
01:05:13,137 --> 01:05:16,800
With the rays in our breath
And a shine when we speak

830
01:05:16,941 --> 01:05:20,778
In the arms of the sun now life will be

831
01:05:20,778 --> 01:05:24,145
With the rays in our breath
And a shine when we speak

832
01:05:32,957 --> 01:05:37,326
Just when the heart
started moving to another beat

833
01:05:40,631 --> 01:05:45,091
Out of nowhere
a new thought found its feet

834
01:05:48,172 --> 01:05:52,009
That life gives you just one shot

835
01:05:52,009 --> 01:05:55,680
So why not love it with all you've got

836
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,548
Who knows what we're waiting for

837
01:05:59,617 --> 01:06:03,849
'Cause life is here and life is now

838
01:06:07,525 --> 01:06:12,553
What was only a desire till yesterday

839
01:06:15,299 --> 01:06:19,599
Is esactly what we've found today

840
01:06:22,673 --> 01:06:25,665
Hand in hand let's always be

841
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:29,638
As we wander through our destiny

842
01:06:30,247 --> 01:06:33,918
And all day and all night

843
01:06:33,918 --> 01:06:38,946
Happiness rains down on
everything in sight

844
01:06:41,158 --> 01:06:45,196
In the arms of the sun now life will be

845
01:06:45,196 --> 01:06:48,927
With the rays in our breath
And a shine when we speak

846
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,837
In the arms of the sun now life will be

847
01:06:52,837 --> 01:06:57,001
With the rays in our breath
And a shine when we speak

848
01:07:12,923 --> 01:07:15,756
If it can knit a new dream everyday

849
01:07:16,761 --> 01:07:19,628
Then you can call it a life

850
01:07:20,531 --> 01:07:23,364
If it can lead you down a brand new way

851
01:07:24,435 --> 01:07:27,233
Then you can call it a life

852
01:07:27,972 --> 01:07:30,873
If it can flirt and fly,
If it can spin and jive

853
01:07:30,941 --> 01:07:32,408
Then you can call it a life
