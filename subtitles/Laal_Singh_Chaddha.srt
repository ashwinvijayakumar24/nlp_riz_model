1
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:26,791
No, thanks.

2
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,208
My mom used to say,

3
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,250
"Life is like <i>golgappas.</i>

4
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,708
Your tummy may be full,
but your heart always craves more."

5
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,291
Greetings.

6
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,083
Myself Laal. Laal Singh Chaddha.

7
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,291
Your shoes are so nice!

8
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,375
So clean!

9
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,041
I can almost see myself in them.

10
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:46,041
My mom used to say,
"Shoes are like an identity card.

11
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,416
Judge a man by his shoes, not his face."

12
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,083
They're old, aren't they?

13
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,833
The thing is…

14
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,208
I love them.

15
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,041
You know I've worn many shoes in life…

16
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,750
but I still remember my first pair.

17
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,416
My mom used to say
they were magic shoes.

18
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:25,875
Okay, Laal.

19
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,000
Ready?

20
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,916
These are magic shoes, Laal.

21
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:36,791
Laal…

22
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,375
-try walking.
-Careful.

23
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,041
-Come on.
-Very good.

24
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:42,957
Go.

25
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,583
Slowly.

26
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,083
There you go. Happy?

27
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,583
I told you his legs are just fine.

28
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,458
It's his mind that has the problem.

29
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,625
Laal!

30
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,000
<i>My name wasn't always Laal.</i>

31
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,291
<i>Laal was my grandpa's name.</i>

32
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:10,833
<i>The year I was born,</i>
<i>my grandpa went to Pakistan…</i>

33
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,541
<i>to fight a war.</i>

34
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,333
<i>But he never returned.</i>

35
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,333
<i>My great-grandpa…</i>
<i>didn't return from World War II.</i>

36
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:32,500
<i>And my great-great-grandpa…</i>
<i>didn't return from World War I.</i>

37
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,250
<i>All three of them were called Laal.</i>

38
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,291
<i>Mom was very proud of all three of them.</i>

39
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:52,208
<i>So, she named me Laal too.</i>

40
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,375
Looking handsome, Laal!

41
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,458
Here you go, ma'am.

42
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,125
The government is offering
big discounts on pesticides.

43
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,958
Use this, it'll double your harvest.

44
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,041
<i>This is Sumati Nandan</i>
<i>reading the afternoon news.</i>

45
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,083
<i>The Prime Minister of India,</i>
<i>Mrs. Indira Gandhi,</i>

46
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:16,500
<i>has announced an end</i>
<i>to the national emergency.</i>

47
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,708
Finally, the emergency has ended.
Thank God.

48
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,333
Laal, hold this.

49
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,791
-Come.
-Let me help you.

50
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,666
Hey, mind your business.
He's capable. He'll do it.

51
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,375
Listen, Laal.
There's nothing that you can't do.

52
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,166
You don't need anyone's help.

53
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,833
If God wanted to make everyone the same,

54
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,666
he would not have created
so many people, right?

55
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,375
<i>My mom used to explain</i>
<i>everything really well.</i>

56
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,250
<i>She was very smart.</i>

57
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,958
<i>She managed the entire farm by herself.</i>

58
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:04,791
<i>We lived in Karoli…</i>
<i>about ten kilometers from Pathankot.</i>

59
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:09,208
<i>We stayed in my mom's family home.</i>

60
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:13,625
<i>My grandpa, my great-grandpa,</i>
<i>or my great-great-grandpa…</i>

61
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,833
<i>one of them built it.</i>

62
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,208
Phuphi!

63
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,166
Come.

64
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,250
Laal, always remember…

65
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,541
you're absolutely fine.
You're just like the other kids.

66
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,291
You're no different.

67
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,125
Your child is different.

68
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:38,875
Look, ma'am.

69
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,083
Some children are very intelligent.

70
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,375
Some are normal,

71
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,041
and some are below normal.

72
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:46,583
Like your Laal.

73
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,000
We cannot enroll him in our school.

74
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,750
Put him in a school for dimwits.

75
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,375
My son is not a dimwit.

76
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:59,125
He understands everything.
It just takes him a little longer.

77
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,000
He should be given the same
opportunities as other kids.

78
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,750
Look, you already hounded me in school.

79
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,916
Now, you have come
to my house on a Sunday!

80
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,166
I have to go to church.
My maid hasn't come in days.

81
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,250
My cook has eloped.

82
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,625
I'm doing the dishes myself!

83
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,333
You know how difficult
it is to get home help, right?

84
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,375
Please leave, and don't come back.

85
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,125
Not even to school.

86
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,166
Wait here.

87
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,666
I'll come and cook for you every day.

88
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,041
I'll clean your house
and even do the dishes.

89
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,125
What does the child's father do?

90
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:51,666
He lives abroad.

91
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,041
You seem to be affluent.
Will you really do my dishes,

92
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,041
cook, and clean?

93
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,708
Yes. For as long as my Laal
is in your school.

94
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,375
You don't give up, do you? Here.

95
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,833
Your mother wants the best for you.

96
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,958
Make sure you study hard.

97
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,125
<i>My first day of school…</i>

98
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,750
<i>was the scariest day of my life…</i>

99
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,125
and the best.

100
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,000
Look, Laal.

101
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,291
You have to work really hard.

102
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,375
You have to do better than your best.

103
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:44,750
Shall I go?

104
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,541
Don't go.

105
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,041
Please.

106
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,708
Hey, come on.
I'll come to get you in the evening.

107
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,083
Please don't leave, Mom.

108
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,500
Just for today.

109
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,458
All right.

110
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,291
I'll wait here.

111
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,708
Once your school is over, come here.

112
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:08,791
Off you go.

113
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,333
My friend sits here.

114
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,500
Not here! Move along!

115
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,375
<i>It's so strange.</i>

116
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,958
<i>We just can't seem</i>
<i>to control our memories.</i>

117
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,166
I don't remember the moment I was born.

118
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,375
I don't remember my first Diwali…

119
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,916
or the first paratha I ate.

120
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:15,958
But…

121
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,083
I clearly remember the moment I heard

122
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,875
the sweetest voice…

123
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,875
in the whole wide world.

124
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:26,833
You can sit here.

125
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,000
<i>Such a pretty face!</i>

126
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,208
<i>I had never seen anything so beautiful.</i>

127
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,625
What are you staring at?
Sit down.

128
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,250
What's up with your legs?

129
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,083
Nothing. I'm perfectly fine.

130
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:05,875
Where do you stay?

131
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,250
At home.

132
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,208
Are you dumb?

133
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,041
No. I'm perfectly fine.

134
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:17,291
<i>Her laughter warmed my heart.</i>

135
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:18,875
What's your name?

136
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,708
Myself Laal. Laal Singh Chaddha.

137
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,125
Myself Rupa. Rupa D'Souza.

138
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,458
<i>From that moment, we became friends.</i>

139
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,250
<i>Rupa lived in Karoli too.</i>

140
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:40,041
<i>Other than my mom,</i>
<i>no one spoke to me so much.</i>

141
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,416
<i>Rupa and I always used to be together.</i>

142
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,958
<i>Like carrots and peas.</i>

143
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,583
<i>Ever since I saw you</i>

144
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,708
<i>I can't stop looking at you</i>

145
00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:08,915
<i>I just can't seem to get enough</i>

146
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,415
<i>What should I do?</i>

147
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:19,000
<i>I love chatting with you</i>

148
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:23,040
<i>I stay up thinking of you</i>

149
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,290
<i>I think I'm going nuts</i>

150
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,540
<i>What should I do?</i>

151
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:39,791
<i>Life stops when you are not around</i>

152
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:47,916
<i>And when you're around</i>
<i>I can't take my eyes off you</i>

153
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:53,416
<i>You are my most favorite person</i>

154
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,416
<i>In the whole wide world</i>

155
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,750
<i>That's how much I love you</i>

156
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,250
<i>What should I do?</i>

157
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,250
<i>Rupa was an amazing magician.</i>

158
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,583
<i>She could pluck a plane</i>
<i>out of the sky and stuff it in her pocket.</i>

159
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,375
<i>She taught me to climb trees,</i>

160
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,375
<i>and I taught her to hang from them.</i>

161
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,875
<i>She taught me to read English,</i>

162
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,125
<i>and I taught her to catch flies.</i>

163
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:56,916
<i>Life stops when you are not around</i>

164
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:05,000
<i>And when you're around</i>
<i>I can't take my eyes off you</i>

165
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:10,708
<i>You are my most favorite person</i>

166
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,750
<i>In the whole wide world</i>

167
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
<i>That's how much I love you</i>

168
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,583
<i>What should I do?</i>

169
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:28,333
<i>Sometimes, we'd just sit</i>
<i>on our tree silently…</i>

170
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,416
<i>waiting for the stars.</i>

171
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,250
Shall we go home?

172
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:37,625
It's getting dark.

173
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,500
Wait just a little longer, please.

174
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,208
Okay.

175
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:50,166
<i>I don't know why,</i>
<i>but Rupa never liked going back home.</i>

176
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,625
<i>My mom bought</i>
<i>the first TV in our village.</i>

177
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,416
<i>The whole village came</i>
<i>over to watch the TV.</i>

178
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:21,458
Rupa…

179
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,208
will you marry me?

180
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,333
India won the World Cup!

181
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,750
India won!

182
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,750
She was my best friend.

183
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,083
My only friend.

184
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:14,500
Rupa.

185
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:15,708
Rupa.

186
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,458
My aunt's name was also Rupa.

187
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,500
My aunt's name is Manjeet.

188
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,666
She used to live in Amritsar.

189
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,541
We often visited her.

190
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,458
Once, when we reached Amritsar station,

191
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:35,083
I saw lots of soldiers there.

192
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,166
Greetings.

193
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,666
Oh, God!

194
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,291
God, help us.

195
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:23,583
Mom.

196
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,500
Laal…

197
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,208
come with me.

198
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:42,416
<i>That night, the lights went out…</i>

199
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:46,791
<i>and didn't come back</i>
<i>for the next four-five days.</i>

200
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:53,916
<i>Over the next few days,</i>
<i>many explosions happened.</i>

201
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:58,041
<i>It felt as if the earth was trembling.</i>

202
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,583
<i>Like it was an earthquake.</i>

203
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,125
<i>Mom was really upset.</i>

204
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:20,750
Don't go out.

205
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:23,833
Why, Mom?

206
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,750
Well…

207
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:30,625
there's a malaria epidemic out there.

208
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,208
Don't go out.

209
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:41,291
During that time,
we didn't leave the house at all.

210
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:46,041
Son, does your aunt
still live in Amritsar?

211
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:49,750
No, sir. She moved to Delhi soon after.

212
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,750
The first time I went to Delhi
was to visit her.

213
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,833
I liked to hang out with my cousin
and his friends.

214
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:02,416
<i>They would dance to film songs.</i>
<i>I liked that.</i>

215
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,500
Look!

216
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,083
Look how the cripple is dancing!

217
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,333
Look!

218
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:17,625
What a clown!

219
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:32,750
<i>One of the boys really liked my moves.</i>

220
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:35,708
Hey, why did you stop?

221
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:37,875
That's a great move.

222
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:39,458
Show me.

223
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:49,000
<i>I taught him my favorite move.</i>

224
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,666
<i>He went on to become a very popular actor.</i>

225
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:12,583
I've seen many of his films.

226
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:15,791
<i>Kuch Kuch Hota Hai,</i>
<i>Kal Ho Na Ho,</i>

227
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:17,291
<i>Main Hoon Na,</i>

228
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:18,875
<i>DDLJ.</i>

229
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:21,333
Who? Shah Rukh Khan?

230
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:23,000
Yes, Shah Rukh Khan!

231
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,000
Such a lovely fellow!

232
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,125
He's from Delhi.

233
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,250
-Have you been to Delhi?
-No, I haven't.

234
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,958
You know I've seen every corner of Delhi.

235
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:38,083
<i>Thanks to my aunt. She was our guide.</i>

236
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,125
This is the PM's residence.

237
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:43,000
Indira Gandhi lives here.

238
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:47,416
Forget all that.
Look there. Smile.

239
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:53,291
<i>Suddenly, one day,</i>
<i>I heard those explosions again.</i>

240
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:56,416
<i>Indira Gandhi…</i>

241
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,791
<i>the ruler of the world's</i>
<i>largest democracy died today,</i>

242
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:02,583
<i>shot down by two</i>
<i>of her own bodyguards.</i>

243
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:06,833
<i>They were Sikhs, taking revenge,</i>
<i>for the invasion of their temple in June.</i>

244
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:14,500
<i>That evening,</i>
<i>we left to take the train back home.</i>

245
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:20,333
<i>Suddenly, some people came running</i>
<i>towards our auto-rickshaw.</i>

246
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,750
Oh, Lord!

247
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:42,750
Madam, take the child and run.

248
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:44,833
Laal, come on! Hurry up!

249
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:48,833
<i>I don't know why they</i>
<i>were so angry with us.</i>

250
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:53,250
<i>We had never even met them before.</i>

251
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:54,541
Get off!

252
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,333
Kill him!

253
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:02,875
Let's go.

254
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:04,291
<i>Mom ran away with me.</i>

255
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:15,541
Hurry up.

256
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:21,125
How dare you come back!

257
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:23,208
Laal, this way.

258
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:25,458
Stop right there!

259
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:31,041
Get him!

260
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:36,625
Hide, Laal. Come on.

261
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,083
Come.

262
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:41,875
Sit here. Good boy.

263
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,708
Quiet. Keep quiet.

264
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,791
Don't let him get away!

265
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:52,791
-Get him!
-Kill him!

266
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:17,708
Lord, please forgive me.

267
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:20,000
Forgive me.

268
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:23,875
Forgive me.

269
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:32,875
<i>Maybe they didn't like my long hair.</i>

270
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:38,250
<i>That's why Mom cut it off.</i>

271
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:53,708
<i>Mom said that the explosions</i>
<i>we had heard that day</i>

272
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:56,250
<i>were actually bullets.</i>

273
00:28:57,833 --> 00:29:01,125
<i>Our Prime Minister was killed by them.</i>

274
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,625
Those were terrible days.

275
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:15,458
Even I was in Delhi at that time.

276
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It's a miracle…

277
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:21,250
that I'm here today.

278
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,708
Yes! My mom used to say,

279
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:26,375
"Life is full of miracles."

280
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,125
Some people don't believe in them,

281
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:32,750
but I can tell you
that miracles do happen.

282
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:35,875
-Hey, dumbo!
-Got him!

283
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:37,041
Stupid fellow!

284
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:39,458
Laal. Hey, Laal.

285
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:41,666
-What a shot!
-Laal, are you hurt?

286
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:44,000
Aim for his skull, boys!

287
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:46,791
Why are you hurting him?

288
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:47,791
Because it's fun!

289
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:51,666
-Laal, run!
-Where will the idiot run to?

290
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,583
-Hey, catch him!
-He's running away!

291
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,333
-Catch him!
-Catch the cripple!

292
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:57,708
You think you can run?

293
00:29:57,916 --> 00:30:00,958
-We won't spare you!
-Where will you go?

294
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:02,333
You're going to get it good!

295
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:03,583
Run, Laal, run!

296
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:28,083
Run, Laal, run!

297
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,583
I know you won't believe me,

298
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:20,416
but I run faster than the wind.

299
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,458
And from that day on,
I ran everywhere.

300
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,458
<i>One day, Rupa didn't come to school.</i>

301
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:02,166
<i>So, I ran all the way to her house.</i>

302
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,041
Hey! Give me ten rupees!

303
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:07,083
-I don't have any.
-I know you do.

304
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:10,500
-I really don't have any.
-Give me money!

305
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:13,083
I said, give me the money!

306
00:32:15,291 --> 00:32:17,958
-Didn't you hear what I said?
-Laal, do you have ten rupees?

307
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:19,958
I already gave you whatever I had!

308
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:21,291
Dad wants it.

309
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:24,083
I know you have more money!
Where is it? Tell me!

310
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:25,916
-Speak up!
-That's Rupa's school fees.

311
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:27,833
I don't care! Give it to me!

312
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,250
Give it to me now!

313
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:30,875
I won't.

314
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:34,250
Oh Lord, please make me rich.

315
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:37,333
Oh Lord, please make me rich.

316
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:40,875
-Oh Lord, please make me rich.
-Oh Lord, please make Rupa rich.

317
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:44,416
-Oh Lord, please make Rupa rich.
-Give me the money right now, or else--

318
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:20,125
That day, Lord didn't make her rich…

319
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,000
but another miracle happened.

320
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:30,041
<i>Rupa's mother had eloped</i>
<i>with a Christian man.</i>

321
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,166
<i>And because of that, Rupa's grandma</i>
<i>had broken off ties with her.</i>

322
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:39,750
<i>After her mother's death,</i>

323
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:45,291
<i>the police took Rupa to her grandma.</i>

324
00:33:57,208 --> 00:34:00,625
<i>And you know who her grandmother was?</i>

325
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,125
<i>Our home help, Phuphi.</i>

326
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:09,333
<i>You see? Miracles do happen.</i>

327
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,333
<i>Rupa started staying with us.</i>

328
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,333
<i>I was very happy.</i>

329
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:30,416
<i>But Rupa remained sad.</i>

330
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:37,291
<i>Sometimes, she would have nightmares.</i>

331
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:43,208
<i>Then, she would come</i>
<i>and sleep next to me.</i>

332
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:59,500
<i>When we got older,</i>
<i>Mom sent Rupa and me</i>

333
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:01,875
<i>to a college in Delhi.</i>

334
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:08,250
-Mr. Advani, we are with you!
<i>-There was a huge chariot on the streets.</i>

335
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,333
<i>Lots of people had gathered.</i>
<i>Even we went to check it out.</i>

336
00:35:12,416 --> 00:35:15,458
-With your support,
-Mr. Advani, we are with you!

337
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:19,458
Mr. Lal Krishna Advani
is embarking on his Chariot Tour.

338
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:20,708
He's your namesake.

339
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:22,791
Really?

340
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:24,583
Lal Krishna Advani.

341
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,791
<i>Even in Delhi,</i>
<i>Rupa and I were always together.</i>

342
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,458
<i>Like carrots and peas.</i>

343
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,666
Got him!

344
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:35,458
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Hey, Laal.

345
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:39,291
<i>But those bullies from our village</i>
<i>were also studying in our college.</i>

346
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,083
Why are you throwing stones at him?

347
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:43,500
-Hey, come on!
-Run, Laal, run!

348
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:46,000
He's running away.
Start the car.

349
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:47,000
Get in.

350
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:48,666
Move it!

351
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:50,541
Get him!

352
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,250
Run, Laal, run!

353
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:56,833
How fast can you run?

354
00:35:59,666 --> 00:36:00,708
We're coming, love.

355
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:01,833
Wait for us!

356
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:06,333
Almost there!

357
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:16,750
Oh, no! He's gone!

358
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,500
On your mark, set…

359
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:35,166
He's flying like a rocket.
Who is he?

360
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:36,708
Sir, Laal Singh.

361
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:37,875
He's a dimwit.

362
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:44,541
Dimwit or not, he runs fast.

363
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:45,791
Bring him to me.

364
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,875
<i>Our lovely audience,</i>

365
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:54,833

373
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:19,375
-Why isn't he running?
-Run, Laal, run!

374
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:23,500
-Run, Laal, run!
-Run, Laal, run!

-Run, Laal, run!

376
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:32,500
-Run, Laal, run!
-Run, Laal, run!

377
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:38,666
Why isn't he stopping?

378
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:40,291
Laal!

379
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:44,958
<i>I was really enjoying myself.</i>

380
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:48,916
<i>I would run a little,</i>
<i>and they'd put me on these steps</i>

381
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,125
<i>and garland me.</i>

382
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:56,208
<i>Welcome to the interuniversity</i>
<i>100-meter race!</i>

00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:00,000
Laal!

385
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,583
Run as soon as you hear the gunshot!

386
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:04,958
Don't stop, boy!
Best of luck! Come on!

387
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:07,625
-Laal Singh!
-Laal Singh!

388
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,458
-Set.
-Laal Singh!

389
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,875
Run, Laal, run!

390
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:17,458
-Run, Laal, run!
-Run, Laal, run!

391
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:22,333
-Run, Laal, run!
-Run, Laal, run!

392
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:24,833
-Run, Laal, run!
-Run, Laal, run!

393
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:30,166
Hey, stop! Hey, where are you going?

394
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,916
You can stop now!

395
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:35,208
You won the race!

396
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:40,041
<i>I joined the National Cadet Corps</i>
<i>in college.</i>

397
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:47,333
<i>I participated in the parade every year.</i>

398
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:51,958
<i>And Rupa participated</i>
<i>in some walking contest.</i>

399
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:12,666
All of a sudden,

400
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:16,791
the University closed for the holidays.

401
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:21,041
-Down with the Mandal Commission!
-Down with the Mandal Commission!

402
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:25,000
-Down with the Mandal Commission!
-Down with the Mandal Commission!

403
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:27,916
<i>-VP Singh, step down!</i>
<i>-VP Singh, step down!</i>

404
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,208
Do you remember
what we spoke about yesterday?

405
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:32,833
I hope you do.

406
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:33,750
What?

407
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:37,458
Hello.

408
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,541
Greetings.

409
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,041
Laal, can you get me
some <i>golgappas,</i> please?

410
00:39:47,416 --> 00:39:48,416
Sure.

411
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:51,625
Where were we?

412
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:55,916
Thank you.

413
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:59,708
<i>Rupa loved</i> golgappas.

414
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:02,083
<i>And I loved Rupa.</i>

415
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:05,125
Tomorrow, I promise. Not today.

416
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:07,083
-Rupa, you're breaking your promise.
-Tomorrow.

417
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:09,208
Please. Just once, Rupa.

418
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:10,250
No. Not today.

419
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:12,375
-We'll do it tomorrow.
-Promise?

420
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:13,875
Yes, I promise--

421
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:15,708
-Laal!
-Rupa!

422
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:16,666
Laal, what are you doing?

423
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,875
Stay away!

424
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:21,666
-Who is this crazy person?
-He isn't crazy. He's my friend.

425
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,333
He's a little slow. Sorry.

426
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:25,500
Well, stay with him then! I'm leaving!

427
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:30,791
Harry, wait!

428
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:39,166
Look what you've done!
Why did you hit him?

429
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:41,083
He was troubling you.

430
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:42,708
He wasn't.

431
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,208
Do you know how rich he is?

432
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:48,250
No, how rich is he?

433
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:56,250
Rupa, <i>golgappas?</i>

434
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:11,375
You should've got
the spiced water separately.

435
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,916
You're right.

436
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,458
Laal…

437
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:32,791
Rupa…

438
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:35,916
will you marry me?

439
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,916
Laal, I want to go to Mumbai.

440
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:48,291
I want to become a model
and then an actress.

441
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:51,833
I'll become famous and very rich.

442
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:55,791
What will you do, Laal?

443
00:41:58,291 --> 00:42:00,541
Mom says I should join the Army.

444
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:04,458
But I don't like killing anyone.

445
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,750
So, Rupa went to Mumbai?!

446
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:26,791
She didn't even answer your question.

447
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:32,750
Sorry, that's my station.

448
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:35,083
-I'll have to leave.
-Bye, Uncle.

449
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:41,583
I was in college around the same time.
I still remember.

450
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,625
We would get so many days off.

451
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:46,291
Yes, and when there were no holidays…

452
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:48,666
there would be a malaria problem.

453
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:50,541
-Malaria?
-Yes.

454
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,250
<i>Mumbai is afire with rioting.</i>

455
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:59,125
<i>The reason being the demolition</i>
<i>of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya.</i>

456
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:04,250
<i>We are receiving reports</i>
<i>of many being injured.</i>

457
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:07,500
<i>Today, the government</i>
<i>has announced a curfew.</i>

458
00:43:07,708 --> 00:43:10,625
<i>The effects of the Mumbai riots</i>
<i>are being felt nationwide.</i>

459
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:12,166
Laal Singh Chaddha!

460
00:43:16,875 --> 00:43:18,125
-Hello.
<i>-Laal.</i>

461
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:20,500
-Mom.
-Son, just stay in your room…

462
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:21,500
for one week.

463
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:22,875
What happened, Mom?

464
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:24,041
Well…

465
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:26,041
malaria is spreading again.

466
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:28,000
Oh, okay.

467
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,041
Laal, why didn't you come
to practice today?

468
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:38,958
Sir, I can't come out.

469
00:43:39,166 --> 00:43:40,791
Malaria is spreading in the country.

470
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:42,875
Malaria?

471
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:44,666
He's stupid, sir.

472
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:49,791
<i>This afternoon, multiple bomb explosions</i>
<i>have shaken the city of Mumbai.</i>

473
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:55,000
<i>The first bomb went off at 1:30 p.m.</i>
<i>at the Bombay Stock Exchange.</i>

474
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:58,083
<i>The last one took place</i>
<i>at Hotel Airport Centaur.</i>

475
00:43:58,458 --> 00:43:59,875
<i>Other than that…</i>

476
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,416
Laal Singh Chaddha!

477
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:05,041
-Laal.
-Mom.

478
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,291
Son, don't get out
of your room for a week.

479
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:08,583
What happened, Mom?

480
00:44:08,666 --> 00:44:11,916
Well… it's malaria again.

481
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,750
Oh, okay.

482
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:22,041
Laal, open the door!
You have a race today!

483
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:23,958
Sir, I can't come out.

484
00:44:24,541 --> 00:44:25,958
Malaria is spreading again.

485
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,958
It's the Nationals! Open up!

486
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,250
No, sir. Mom said no going out.

487
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:32,791
Talk to him!

488
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:34,041
I told you he's stupid.

489
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:36,291
Shut up!

490
00:44:37,416 --> 00:44:41,416
Well, I didn't know it would be so easy
to graduate from the university.

491
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,458
I ran through it.

492
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:46,500
From the BA program, Laal Singh Chaddha.

493
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:04,041
Here.

494
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:10,583
<i>Mom used to say that every man</i>
<i>from our family served in the Army.</i>

495
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,000
<i>So, it was natural for me</i>
<i>to join the Army as well.</i>

496
00:45:15,666 --> 00:45:18,291
Greetings, sir.
Myself Laal. Laal Singh Chaddha.

497
00:45:18,708 --> 00:45:20,041
So? What are you grinning about?

498
00:45:20,416 --> 00:45:21,291
Go, sit!

499
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:29,083
This seat is taken.

500
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,500
This one too. Go to the back.

501
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:37,833
<i>I got scared.</i>

502
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:42,875
<i>I was scolded on the first day</i>
<i>of my training.</i>

503
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:46,416
<i>I didn't even have a friend there.</i>

504
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,375
Come, sit here.

505
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Do you wear underpants?

506
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:06,666
Yes.

507
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:09,000
Which one? A-front or V-front?

508
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:14,583
I'm not sure, brother.
I wear whatever Mom buys for me.

509
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:20,208
Undergarments are very
important for a man.

510
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:23,166
I have been making my own since childhood.

511
00:46:23,958 --> 00:46:26,125
My grandfather was
an undergarments expert.

512
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:30,708
My name is Balaraju. I'm from Bodipalem.

513
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,500
Everyone calls me Bala.

514
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:35,083
Myself Laal Singh Chaddha.

515
00:46:35,583 --> 00:46:36,916
I'm from Karoli, Pathankot.

516
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,375
-Everyone calls me Laal.
-Okay.

517
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:42,333
-Pleased to meet you.
-Same here.

518
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:49,250
<i>Bala's family was</i>
<i>in the undergarments business.</i>

519
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:55,708
<i>His grandpa stitched undergarments</i>
<i>for freedom fighters.</i>

520
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,875
<i>His great-grandpa made</i>
<i>undergarments for the British.</i>

521
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:10,041
<i>And his great-great-grandpa</i>

522
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:14,125
<i>used to tailor undergarments</i>
<i>for kings and nawabs.</i>

523
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:20,416
<i>He knew everything about undergarments.</i>

524
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:23,708
I know everything about undergarments.

525
00:47:24,166 --> 00:47:28,208
After serving in the Army,
I will start my undergarments business.

526
00:47:41,166 --> 00:47:42,541
Laal Singh Chaddha!

527
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:43,750
Yes, sir!

528
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:45,541
As an army officer, what is your duty?

529
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:48,000
Sir, to follow your orders!

530
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:51,416
Bloody hell. You're a genius.

531
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:53,041
Genius!

532
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:55,500
Did you know that you are a genius, Laal?

533
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:57,833
No, sir. I just found out.

534
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,041
Genius.

535
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,208
Did you hear that?

536
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:04,458
That's a genius.

537
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:07,333
You must follow my orders…

538
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:10,791
<i>I found school tough,</i>

539
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:14,208
<i>but the Army was really easy.</i>

540
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:16,833
<i>I just had to remember a few things.</i>

541
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:19,291
<i>Make a tidy bed.</i>

542
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:20,666
<i>Stand straight.</i>

543
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:23,125
<i>And answer every question with…</i>

544
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:24,708
-Sir, yes, sir!
-Sir, yes, sir!

545
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:28,791
Brother…

546
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:32,666
your vest is wrongly cut.

547
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:36,750
Look, it's loose here and tight here.

548
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:39,833
Look at mine.

549
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,416
See the fit.

550
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,250
The armhole doesn't stretch.

551
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:44,833
Very comfortable.

552
00:48:47,208 --> 00:48:50,541
Even your underpants are wrongly cut.

553
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:53,083
-Oh!
-Look at mine.

554
00:48:57,625 --> 00:48:59,000
My grandpa made it.

555
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:01,708
It's lovely.

556
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:05,083
There's not a man in my village…

557
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:08,500
who doesn't wear undergarments
made by my grandpa.

558
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:13,541
-The weapon is ready, sir.
-What?

559
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:18,500
My God! You've broken the record!

560
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:22,208
-How did you finish it so quickly?
-You said to do it quickly, sir.

561
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:25,750
Bloody hell! You're a genius! Genius!

562
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:26,833
Do it again!

563
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:27,958
Yes, sir!

564
00:49:28,291 --> 00:49:29,250
Genius.

565
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:30,708
Genius.

566
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:32,458
Genius.

567
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:34,166
Genius.

568
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:36,291
As I was saying…

569
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:40,541
now, there are newer fabrics available
to make undergarments.

570
00:49:41,041 --> 00:49:45,125
I want to make undergarments
that stay dry even when you sweat.

571
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:46,625
They'll really sell.

572
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:48,833
Tell me, brother,

573
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,250
have you ever met a man
who doesn't wear undergarments?

574
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:58,625
Even a homeless beggar
who doesn't own anything

575
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:00,750
wears undergarments.

576
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:06,583
Life isn't comfortable
without good undergarments.

577
00:50:07,041 --> 00:50:09,250
Life is a reflection
of your undergarments.

578
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:12,208
I want to make all types of undergarments.

579
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:16,666
One for the winter
and one for the summer.

580
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:20,625
One for sports and one for sleep.

581
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:22,875
And a special pair for honeymooners.

582
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:27,291
Do you want to learn?

583
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:31,375
Sure.

584
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:36,500
<i>Bala taught me to make undergarments,</i>

585
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:40,375
<i>and I made my first vest for him.</i>

586
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:48,541
<i>I made the second one for Lieutenant.</i>

587
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:50,375
Genius!

588
00:50:56,458 --> 00:50:58,333
<i>They became very popular,</i>

589
00:50:58,583 --> 00:51:03,875
<i>and I spent every holiday</i>
<i>making them for everyone.</i>

590
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:08,750
Switch on the TV quickly.
The Miss Universe pageant is on.

591
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:13,333
<i>The first runner-up is…</i>

592
00:51:13,708 --> 00:51:15,375
<i>Miss Columbia!</i>

593
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:17,708
<i>That means, Sushmita Sen, Miss India…</i>

594
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:21,625
<i>you are the new Miss Universe 1994.</i>

595
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:27,125
<i>Congratulations, Miss India Sushmita Sen,</i>

596
00:51:27,208 --> 00:51:30,791
<i>you are the new Miss Universe 1994.</i>

597
00:51:30,875 --> 00:51:33,625
<i>The stage is yours</i>
<i>for the traditional walk.</i>

598
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:47,958
<i>Everyone in the Army</i>
<i>gets really lonely at night.</i>

599
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:52,375
<i>I missed Rupa terribly.</i>

600
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:58,208
<i>I hadn't heard from her</i>
<i>ever since she had gone to Mumbai.</i>

601
00:51:58,291 --> 00:52:00,583
Laal, look.

602
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,458
Two naked people and a snake.

603
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,958
Lucky snake!

604
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:14,000
<i>The news said</i>
<i>that Rupa was in trouble.</i>

605
00:52:15,416 --> 00:52:19,916
<i>Apparently, people didn't like</i>
<i>some pictures of hers.</i>

606
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:24,208
<i>So, the police put her in prison.</i>

607
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:26,916
<i>I was very worried about her.</i>

608
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:29,833
<i>I took leave and went to Mumbai.</i>

609
00:52:30,875 --> 00:52:33,958
-Rupa D'Souza!
-Shame! Shame!

610
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:37,125
-Rupa D'Souza!
-Shame! Shame!

611
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:41,583
-Rupa D'Souza!
-Shame! Shame!

612
00:52:41,666 --> 00:52:43,625
-Rupa!
-Hey, sexy!

613
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:46,291
If you like posing nude,
why don't you strip for me?

614
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:49,208
Hey, why did you hit him?

615
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,958
Hey, how dare you!

616
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:53,916
Why did you agree to do this kind
of photo shoot in the first place?

617
00:52:54,166 --> 00:52:55,166
Laal!

618
00:52:58,833 --> 00:52:59,666
Laal!

619
00:53:00,166 --> 00:53:01,583
Laal!

620
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:04,166
Laal!

621
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:06,083
Laal!

622
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:15,833
What was the need for all this?

623
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:18,750
You can't keep landing up
everywhere to save me.

624
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:20,500
He was…

625
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:24,125
saying bad things about you.

626
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:25,166
So what?

627
00:53:25,708 --> 00:53:27,375
A lot of people say bad things about me.

628
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:29,416
Who all will you save me from?

629
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:30,541
Everyone.

630
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,333
-Really?
-Yes.

631
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:41,083
Rupa.

632
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:51,750
Rupa…

633
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:58,500
will you marry me?

634
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:01,375
-Do you even know what marriage means?
-Yes, I do.

635
00:54:14,916 --> 00:54:16,625
We're very different
from each other, Laal.

636
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:20,041
I don't want an ordinary life.

637
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:23,041
I want to make it really big.

638
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:25,708
Make a lot of money.

639
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:29,125
But I don't know where to start.

640
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,625
I really like you, Laal.

641
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:52,208
But we'll always be just friends.

642
00:54:58,416 --> 00:54:59,625
I should go now.

643
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,625
In a few days,

644
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:07,791
I'll be posted.

645
00:55:09,291 --> 00:55:10,250
I don't know where.

646
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,750
Listen, be careful.

647
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:22,125
Don't try to be brave.

648
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:25,916
If it gets too dangerous, just run.

649
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:28,000
Got it?

650
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:44,583
Rupa!

651
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:47,458
I'll write letters to you every day.

652
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:52,666
Let's go.

653
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:02,083
<i>With that…</i>

654
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:04,083
<i>Rupa left.</i>

655
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,833
<i>Second floor.</i>

656
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:28,875
Abbas…

657
00:56:30,166 --> 00:56:32,000
this is Rupa.

658
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:34,125
I had told you about her.

659
00:56:35,416 --> 00:56:36,666
She wants to be a heroine.

660
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:12,791
<i>Bala and I finished our training in 1995.</i>

661
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,083
<i>He got married a year later.</i>

662
00:57:23,666 --> 00:57:26,875
<i>I had not seen Rupa in four years.</i>

663
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:31,250
Missing home?

664
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:33,000
Me too.

665
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:39,750
My family.

666
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:44,166
Chithra. Bhawani. Banu.

667
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:47,041
-Junior Bala.
-Yes.

668
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:48,375
Junior Bala.

669
00:57:52,416 --> 00:57:54,375
I've been wanting to ask you something.

670
00:57:54,916 --> 00:57:56,541
-May I?
-Yes.

671
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,458
Will you be my business partner?

672
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:01,916
I've thought a lot about it.

673
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:06,208
After serving in the Army,
we can start an undergarments business.

674
00:58:06,625 --> 00:58:08,625
I have a foolproof plan. Here.

675
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:12,333
You take care of manufacturing,
and I'll do the marketing.

676
00:58:12,916 --> 00:58:15,250
We need to invest only 100,000 rupees.

677
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:17,166
Three sewing machines will cost us 30,000.

678
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:20,250
You run one machine,
and we'll hire two tailors.

679
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:22,791
You'll stitch 20 sets
of undergarments a day,

680
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,916
and the tailors will do ten each.

681
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:27,166
That's 1000 a month. Right?

682
00:58:27,541 --> 00:58:32,166
From the next month onward,
we will easily sell 800 sets.

683
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:36,083
I think we'll see profits in three months.

684
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:38,041
Yeah.

685
00:58:38,791 --> 00:58:40,625
-How's my plan?
-Very good.

686
00:58:41,458 --> 00:58:42,916
So, will you become my partner?

687
00:58:43,166 --> 00:58:44,375
-Okay.
-Really?

688
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:56,375
<i>The following day,</i>
<i>we were sent on a mission.</i>

689
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,416
<i>We were posted in Kargil those days.</i>

690
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:03,208
<i>Captain told us that some enemies</i>
<i>had entered our territory.</i>

691
00:59:03,375 --> 00:59:04,625
<i>We had to get rid of them.</i>

692
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:27,791
You don't like to kill anyone, do you?

693
00:59:31,291 --> 00:59:32,250
Me neither.

694
00:59:33,166 --> 00:59:36,625
We're both the same. A perfect pair…

695
00:59:37,333 --> 00:59:39,166
like underpants and a vest.

696
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,583
Brothers forever.

697
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:51,333
<i>Local shepherds informed us…</i>

698
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:55,375
<i>that five-six enemy soldiers</i>
<i>had set up a bunker in our territory.</i>

699
00:59:59,041 --> 01:00:02,666
<i>Those local shepherds</i>
<i>came along to guide us.</i>

700
01:00:13,666 --> 01:00:16,333
<i>I thought of my grandpas.</i>

701
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,000
<i>They must have also fought such wars.</i>

702
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:22,000
Up there.

703
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:10,166
Papa Oscar 1, go to the left
toward those rocks.

704
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,833
And Papa Oscar 2, toward the right…

705
01:01:12,916 --> 01:01:17,458
<i>Captain sent two teams of six each</i>

706
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:21,041
<i>to the left and right for covering fire.</i>

707
01:01:22,333 --> 01:01:25,875
<i>In the center was the attacking team.</i>

708
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,500
<i>Bala and I were on the attacking team.</i>

709
01:01:40,416 --> 01:01:44,000
<i>We took cover behind rocks</i>
<i>and made our way up.</i>

710
01:02:02,708 --> 01:02:03,541
Wait.

711
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:07,250
Let the lowlifes come closer.

712
01:02:14,666 --> 01:02:16,625
<i>We didn't know then,</i>

713
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,166
<i>but the enemies were not just six.</i>

714
01:02:20,166 --> 01:02:21,500
<i>There were many of them.</i>

715
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,416
Fire!

716
01:02:42,583 --> 01:02:43,625
He's hurt.

717
01:02:49,291 --> 01:02:50,916
<i>There was a barrage of bullets.</i>

718
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,333
Fire!

719
01:02:52,416 --> 01:02:53,916
Keep firing!

720
01:03:03,333 --> 01:03:04,458
Kill them all!

721
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,958
There's a whole battalion of them.

722
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:13,750
Smoke cover!

723
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:16,458
Boys, give me smoke cover!
Come on!

724
01:03:26,666 --> 01:03:27,625
Sir.

725
01:03:27,708 --> 01:03:30,833
Inform the Bofors Gun Position
to start firing at point 3928.

726
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:32,791
-In exactly five minutes.
-Roger, sir.

727
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,083
Tango 1! Over!

728
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:38,208
Go for the gun position!

729
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:42,166
Bofors fire required
on point 3928 in five minutes.

730
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:45,250
Roger! Confirming artillery fire
on point 3928 in five minutes!

731
01:03:45,583 --> 01:03:46,833
All teams, fall back.

732
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:49,750
All teams, fall back! Right away!

733
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:53,041
Bofors firing to start
on point 3928 in five minutes!

734
01:03:53,458 --> 01:03:56,666
Right after the firing,
we will attack again!

735
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,791
We will take back this camp today!

736
01:03:59,875 --> 01:04:01,000
Laal!

737
01:04:10,041 --> 01:04:10,875
They're falling back.

738
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:14,500
They're falling back. Follow me.

739
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:20,166
Give him cover!

740
01:04:43,416 --> 01:04:45,875
Laal!

741
01:04:54,666 --> 01:04:55,916
Laal!

742
01:04:56,541 --> 01:04:57,833
Hurry up!

743
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:00,583
Laal!

744
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:02,916
Laal, are you okay?

745
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:07,666
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

746
01:05:11,291 --> 01:05:14,833
Come on, Laal, get up! Let's go!

747
01:05:14,916 --> 01:05:18,750
Bofors firing is going to start
in less than five minutes.

748
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:22,083
Hurry up, Laal! Come on!

749
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,416
Laal.

750
01:05:26,791 --> 01:05:28,000
Laal!

751
01:05:28,666 --> 01:05:31,791
Run, Laal, run!

752
01:05:44,458 --> 01:05:45,416
<i>I ran.</i>

753
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:47,875
<i>Just as Rupa had told me to, I ran.</i>

754
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,625
<i>I ran fast, but after some time,</i>
<i>I realized that I was running alone.</i>

755
01:05:56,583 --> 01:05:57,500
Bala?

756
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:04,791
<i>I didn't know where Bala was.</i>

757
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,416
<i>So, I ran back to find him.</i>

758
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Bala!

759
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,125
<i>Every time I would go back to find Bala,</i>

760
01:06:47,708 --> 01:06:49,208
<i>someone would ask me for help.</i>

761
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:57,208
<i>I saw my grandpas in every wounded person.</i>

762
01:06:58,291 --> 01:07:00,166
<i>It was one such war</i>
<i>they never returned from.</i>

763
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,416
Laal, where are you going?

764
01:07:53,666 --> 01:07:54,625
Bala!

765
01:07:54,916 --> 01:07:56,291
Are you crazy?

766
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:59,541
Bofors firing is going
to start any second.

767
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:01,875
The mountain is dangerous.

768
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:03,708
Bala! My brother!

769
01:08:14,416 --> 01:08:15,291
Bala.

770
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,082
Laal.

771
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:19,832
What's this?

772
01:08:23,541 --> 01:08:25,875
You're hurt very badly.

773
01:08:27,666 --> 01:08:31,416
Don't worry. I'm here now.

774
01:08:35,375 --> 01:08:37,416
<i>Bala was hurt very badly.</i>

775
01:08:38,875 --> 01:08:40,416
<i>I carried him and ran.</i>

776
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:46,041
<i>Out of nowhere, a bee stung me.</i>

777
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:55,832
I won't let anything happen to you.

778
01:09:14,207 --> 01:09:15,041
Brother…

779
01:09:17,207 --> 01:09:18,707
Why did this happen, Laal?

780
01:09:22,416 --> 01:09:23,416
Laal…

781
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:26,875
I want to go home.

782
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:30,375
I want to go to my mother.

783
01:09:37,457 --> 01:09:39,666
Bala.

784
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:41,916
My brother.

785
01:09:42,375 --> 01:09:45,707
Bala. My brother.

786
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:06,791
<i>All Bala wanted was</i>
<i>to go back home and start a business.</i>

787
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:12,250
<i>But he died in Kargil.</i>

788
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:48,208
That's all I have to say about that.

789
01:11:14,708 --> 01:11:16,666
The war ended a few days later.

790
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:19,916
Everyone was celebrating our victory.

791
01:11:22,833 --> 01:11:25,416
But I couldn't stop thinking about Bala.

792
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:30,750
Uncle, was it a bullet?

793
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:35,583
The bee sting.
Wasn't that a bullet?

794
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:37,583
Yes.

795
01:11:37,666 --> 01:11:38,625
Where did you get shot?

796
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,375
-On my bum. Would you like to see it?
-No, it's fine.

797
01:11:45,375 --> 01:11:48,000
There's one perk
of getting shot in the bum.

798
01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:49,750
Ice lollies.

799
01:11:49,833 --> 01:11:52,750
<i>I used to have 18 lollies in a day.</i>

800
01:11:58,375 --> 01:12:01,416
Greetings. Myself Laal.
Laal Singh Chaddha.

801
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:07,333
Hello, Mohammad Paaji.

802
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:09,125
Ice lolly?

803
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:11,958
Take it, Mohammad Paaji.

804
01:12:19,875 --> 01:12:20,791
Banu Chandar.

805
01:12:22,291 --> 01:12:23,291
Raman Kumar.

806
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:26,166
Satyajit Pande.

807
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:29,125
Moinak Banerjee.

808
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:32,541
Kulwinder Bakshish.

809
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:35,541
Manoj Moily.

810
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:38,208
Hemant Pandey.

811
01:12:40,041 --> 01:12:41,041
Shahid Hussain.

812
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:45,166
Laal Singh Chaddha.

813
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:47,291
Laal Singh Chaddha!

814
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:55,291
<i>All my letters came back.</i>

815
01:12:56,875 --> 01:12:59,541
<i>Perhaps, Rupa hadn't</i>
<i>gone home in many days.</i>

816
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:04,416
Yes, Rohit. Done.
We'll shoot in Switzerland.

817
01:13:04,916 --> 01:13:05,958
Okay, bye.

818
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:07,625
Sir, good news.

819
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:10,083
We've got Rohit Kumar's
dates from next month.

820
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:12,083
-Congratulations!
-Cheers!

821
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:13,000
Cheers!

822
01:13:13,083 --> 01:13:15,375
-Congratulations, Abbas.
-Who'd dare turn Abbas down!

823
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:17,541
I'm the heroine in this film, right?

824
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:22,166
Do you want to be Rohit's heroine or mine?

825
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:25,000
Tell me.

826
01:13:25,083 --> 01:13:27,250
Boss has got style.

827
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:28,958
Drama even in romance.

828
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:30,583
I'm your heroine, of course.

829
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:31,875
Wow!

830
01:13:32,416 --> 01:13:34,541
That's true love.

831
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,625
Go, get me a drink.

832
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:41,791
Sir, you know what?

833
01:13:43,083 --> 01:13:44,625
Priya is pretty popular nowadays.

834
01:13:45,125 --> 01:13:47,208
Yes, Priya will be good.

835
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:49,750
Call her.

836
01:14:09,041 --> 01:14:10,791
Has anyone seen that local Mohammad?

837
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:12,875
He's missing since morning.

838
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:14,625
Something's wrong.

839
01:14:15,833 --> 01:14:17,250
I can't find his record.

840
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:19,250
The information he gave is incorrect.

841
01:14:19,625 --> 01:14:20,541
And now, he's missing.

842
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:23,458
Whom did you save, Laal?

843
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:28,291
Yes, sir. Yes.

844
01:14:28,625 --> 01:14:31,958
Naik Laal Singh Chaddha.
The Commanding Officer wants to see you.

845
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:33,291
Naik Laal Singh…

846
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:37,916
you are being awarded
the Veer Chakra for saving five lives.

847
01:14:38,958 --> 01:14:40,041
You must head to Delhi.

848
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:42,750
Yes, sir.

849
01:14:43,458 --> 01:14:46,333
How is your butt, by the way?

850
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:48,166
It hurts sometimes, sir.

851
01:14:48,375 --> 01:14:52,666
Your medical category
has been permanently downgraded.

852
01:14:53,083 --> 01:14:55,708
You can't fight in a war again.

853
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:59,791
You can ask them to discharge you
from the Army on medical grounds.

854
01:15:00,166 --> 01:15:01,083
I will approve it.

855
01:15:01,416 --> 01:15:05,166
Until then, be the assistant coach
of our running team.

856
01:15:06,083 --> 01:15:07,000
Yes, sir.

857
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:08,458
Well done, my boy.

858
01:15:10,541 --> 01:15:11,791
The nation is proud of you.

859
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:14,291
Thank you, sir.

860
01:15:28,125 --> 01:15:29,583
<i>In broad daylight,</i>

861
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:33,708
<i>midst of raining bullets,</i>

862
01:15:33,916 --> 01:15:36,208
<i>and without a care for his own life…</i>

863
01:15:36,625 --> 01:15:40,333
<i>Naik Laal Singh Chaddha</i>
<i>saved five lives.</i>

864
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:44,625
<i>The Indian Army salutes this bravery.</i>

865
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:47,250
<i>Naik Laal Singh Chaddha.</i>

866
01:15:55,833 --> 01:15:56,958
That's my son.

867
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:13,875
Your grandpa would've
been very proud today.

868
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:23,166
What do you plan to do now, Laal?

869
01:16:23,708 --> 01:16:26,333
I'll go to Aunt Manjeet's house from here.

870
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,833
From tomorrow, back to duty.

871
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:31,666
Beyond that, I don't know.

872
01:16:32,583 --> 01:16:34,541
Laal, ask them to discharge you
from the Army.

873
01:16:35,708 --> 01:16:36,583
Come home.

874
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:39,541
Okay.

875
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,416
Good.

876
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:44,833
Call me when you get back to camp.

877
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:45,958
Bless you.

878
01:16:46,416 --> 01:16:48,041
Bye.

879
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,500
Take care.

880
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:05,666
Rupa!

881
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:08,666
Rupa!

882
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,458
Rupa!

883
01:17:13,291 --> 01:17:14,750
Where are you going, sir?

884
01:17:14,833 --> 01:17:16,625
Sir!

885
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,708
Rupa!

886
01:17:27,625 --> 01:17:28,458
Rupa!

887
01:17:33,291 --> 01:17:34,250
Rupa!

888
01:17:46,791 --> 01:17:47,666
Rupa!

889
01:18:02,416 --> 01:18:05,250
-Is everyone here?
-Yes. They're waiting for you.

890
01:18:17,833 --> 01:18:19,208
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

891
01:18:59,458 --> 01:19:00,458
-Oh, no!
-Laal?

892
01:19:00,916 --> 01:19:01,916
-Laal!
-Hey!

893
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,458
Hey!

894
01:19:03,791 --> 01:19:04,875
Hey, stop it!

895
01:19:04,958 --> 01:19:06,416
-How dare you…
-Laal!

896
01:19:06,791 --> 01:19:09,250
Laal!

897
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:11,000
Laal!

898
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:12,833
Laal!

899
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:15,583
Laal!

900
01:19:17,291 --> 01:19:19,958
Boss, he's from the Army.
It could get messy.

901
01:19:20,541 --> 01:19:22,666
-Who's he?
-My childhood friend.

902
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:24,625
He's crazy.
He doesn't know who you are.

903
01:19:24,708 --> 01:19:26,541
-Let him go.
-He shouldn't have hit you.

904
01:19:26,625 --> 01:19:29,000
Keep quiet. You don't know anything.
Let's go.

905
01:19:29,083 --> 01:19:30,416
He shouldn't have hit you.

906
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,458
Shut up, Laal!

907
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:34,291
Let him go, love, forgive him.

908
01:19:39,333 --> 01:19:40,625
You're lucky…

909
01:19:41,208 --> 01:19:42,708
I respect the Army.

910
01:19:44,125 --> 01:19:45,291
Come, love. Let's go.

911
01:19:49,625 --> 01:19:52,041
-Sir, what happened? Are you okay?
-Not now.

912
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:07,500
You've come to your aunt's after so long,

913
01:20:07,625 --> 01:20:10,583
and you haven't said a word.
Is everything okay?

914
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:12,458
Hello.

915
01:20:14,666 --> 01:20:17,041
Rupa! It's been so long!

916
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:20,500
Yes, Laal's right here.

917
01:20:21,125 --> 01:20:22,083
Talk to him.

918
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:26,708
Hello.

919
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:28,333
Laal…

920
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:32,583
he's gone out with friends.
He will be back in the morning.

921
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:35,125
Can you meet me at India Gate?

922
01:20:36,083 --> 01:20:38,125
Yes. Okay.

923
01:20:46,666 --> 01:20:48,125
Do you know how dangerous he is?

924
01:20:49,208 --> 01:20:50,541
You shouldn't have hit him.

925
01:20:50,833 --> 01:20:52,708
He shouldn't have hit you, Rupa.

926
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:57,500
He looks after me well.

927
01:20:58,791 --> 01:21:01,125
I'm going to be the heroine
in his next film.

928
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,750
It's just that he has anger issues.

929
01:21:04,791 --> 01:21:06,333
I would never treat you like that.

930
01:21:08,583 --> 01:21:09,541
I know, Laal.

931
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,083
I wanted to be your boyfriend.

932
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:21,541
Looking good… in uniform.

933
01:21:22,625 --> 01:21:23,500
Handsome.

934
01:21:25,791 --> 01:21:27,583
With you, after so many years,

935
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,083
back in Delhi…

936
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:31,666
it feels nice.

937
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:33,958
It does.

938
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:42,291
<i>We walked all night.</i>

939
01:21:42,666 --> 01:21:43,708
<i>Rupa and I.</i>

940
01:21:44,416 --> 01:21:46,125
<i>We were talking all night.</i>

941
01:21:49,375 --> 01:21:54,333
<i>She told me that she</i>
<i>worked in top-notch films.</i>

942
01:21:56,541 --> 01:21:57,625
<i>Traveled the world.</i>

943
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,541
<i>Met many famous people.</i>

944
01:22:10,541 --> 01:22:12,000
<i>Everyone respected her a lot.</i>

945
01:22:17,375 --> 01:22:20,166
<i>She said that she was very happy.</i>

946
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,125
<i>She was enjoying life.</i>

947
01:22:24,875 --> 01:22:26,416
<i>She was living a first-class life.</i>

948
01:22:30,375 --> 01:22:36,791
<i>A night like this may never come again</i>

949
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:44,583
<i>One that brings us together</i>

950
01:22:45,375 --> 01:22:52,333
<i>A night like this may never come again</i>

951
01:22:52,791 --> 01:22:59,041
<i>One that brings us together</i>

952
01:22:59,125 --> 01:23:03,375
<i>I want to gaze at you</i>

953
01:23:03,458 --> 01:23:06,625
<i>From up close, all night</i>

954
01:23:06,708 --> 01:23:10,500
<i>Don't want to let you go, not this time</i>

955
01:23:10,916 --> 01:23:13,958
<i>I want you to stay</i>

956
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:18,458
<i>Are you really here with me?</i>

957
01:23:18,541 --> 01:23:21,541
<i>Or is this a dream?</i>

958
01:23:21,625 --> 01:23:25,791
<i>I don't trust my eyes</i>

959
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:29,625
<i>Why don't you tell me?</i>

960
01:23:30,375 --> 01:23:36,291
<i>Once again, I yearn to tell you</i>

961
01:23:37,833 --> 01:23:44,666
<i>How I feel about you</i>

962
01:23:45,375 --> 01:23:52,291
<i>A night like this may never come again</i>

963
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:59,750
<i>One that brings us together</i>

964
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:35,500
I should go now.

965
01:24:38,583 --> 01:24:39,916
We're leaving for Dubai today.

966
01:24:41,458 --> 01:24:42,541
You shouldn't go to Dubai.

967
01:24:42,875 --> 01:24:45,000
-Then where should I go?
-Come home.

968
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,875
Why are you so good to me, Laal?

969
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:55,916
Because you're my Rupa.

970
01:25:09,208 --> 01:25:11,041
I will always be your Rupa.

971
01:25:23,333 --> 01:25:27,083
<i>Don't want to let you go</i>

972
01:25:28,125 --> 01:25:31,750
<i>Not this time</i>

973
01:25:32,958 --> 01:25:38,416
<i>I want you to stay</i>

974
01:25:39,916 --> 01:25:41,250
Then, once again,

975
01:25:42,041 --> 01:25:44,041
Rupa walked out of my life.

976
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:50,500
And I went back to the Army.

977
01:25:50,583 --> 01:25:55,666
<i>In the Army, I traveled the world</i>
<i>for a year with the running team.</i>

978
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,666
You were given a medal
by your government!

979
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:03,333
For saving me?!

980
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:04,875
Mohammad Paaji!

981
01:26:08,375 --> 01:26:12,250
A dimwit like you
was awarded by your government.

982
01:26:12,791 --> 01:26:13,666
Yes.

983
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:16,541
And now you travel abroad
on government funds?!

984
01:26:16,958 --> 01:26:17,916
Yes.

985
01:26:18,166 --> 01:26:19,708
What a fine government!

986
01:26:20,166 --> 01:26:21,375
How are you, Mohammad Paaji?

987
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:26,541
Still very much a cripple.

988
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:29,958
I spotted my savior…

989
01:26:31,625 --> 01:26:34,458
and thought I should
curse him to his face…

990
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:37,208
with my choicest abuses.

991
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:47,000
<i>Mohammad Paaji lived in a small room.</i>

992
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:52,166
<i>Someone sponsored a phone booth</i>
<i>at the airport for him to operate.</i>

993
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:57,083
<i>He found it inappropriate</i>
<i>to hurl abuses at me in public,</i>

994
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,333
<i>so he took me to his house.</i>

995
01:27:09,166 --> 01:27:11,250
Paaji, is this where you live? In Mumbai?

996
01:27:12,333 --> 01:27:14,708
Well, I tried desperately to go back home.

997
01:27:16,458 --> 01:27:17,291
I really did.

998
01:27:19,333 --> 01:27:20,958
They disowned the dead.

999
01:27:22,125 --> 01:27:23,583
How would they accept a living man?

1000
01:27:25,208 --> 01:27:26,041
Why?

1001
01:27:27,583 --> 01:27:28,708
I was no longer of use to them.

1002
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:37,000
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>

1003
01:27:37,583 --> 01:27:41,541
<i>God has prepared such a heaven for you…</i>

1004
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:48,541
<i>where there are 72 heavenly companions</i>
<i>for each and every man.</i>

1005
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:52,458
<i>Heavenly companions with skin so sheer</i>

1006
01:27:52,541 --> 01:27:56,291
<i>that you can see right through</i>
<i>to the marrow of their bones.</i>

1007
01:27:57,916 --> 01:27:58,958
There's God's word,

1008
01:27:59,791 --> 01:28:01,250
and then those who interpret it.

1009
01:28:02,916 --> 01:28:05,958
And fools like us forget God
and get swayed.

1010
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:16,625
Did you know who I was…

1011
01:28:18,083 --> 01:28:19,250
when you saved me?

1012
01:28:22,083 --> 01:28:23,000
Tell me.

1013
01:28:24,208 --> 01:28:25,250
Did you know who I was?

1014
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:28,250
No.

1015
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,208
I was the enemy, you fool!

1016
01:28:32,958 --> 01:28:34,208
I was there to kill you…

1017
01:28:35,916 --> 01:28:37,250
and to be martyred in glory.

1018
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,208
See my cursed luck!

1019
01:28:43,625 --> 01:28:45,833
My own enemy carried me to safety…

1020
01:28:50,333 --> 01:28:52,125
trying to save my legless torso.

1021
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:03,833
Buy me a drink, Mr. Laal.

1022
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:08,000
Isn't it a good plan?

1023
01:29:09,125 --> 01:29:13,250
Bala said I'd handle manufacturing
and he'd handle marketing.

1024
01:29:13,625 --> 01:29:15,625
But he isn't here anymore.

1025
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,500
So, now, I'll do both.

1026
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:22,166
You… will start a business?!

1027
01:29:22,958 --> 01:29:24,000
Of undergarments?

1028
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:25,750
Manufacturing and marketing?

1029
01:29:25,833 --> 01:29:29,250
Yes. I had promised Bala in Kargil.

1030
01:29:29,833 --> 01:29:30,958
We're partners, you see.

1031
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:39,708
Meet him. Laal Singh Chaddha.

1032
01:29:40,791 --> 01:29:42,041
Naik Laal Singh Chaddha.

1033
01:29:42,833 --> 01:29:44,916
Millionaire Laal Singh Chaddha.

1034
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,125
Businessman Laal Singh Chaddha…

1035
01:29:48,458 --> 01:29:51,833
whose marketing manager died
even before the business started.

1036
01:29:52,458 --> 01:29:53,458
Good Lord!

1037
01:29:55,291 --> 01:29:58,375
Laal, if you become a manufacturer,

1038
01:29:58,875 --> 01:30:00,583
I'll become your marketing manager.

1039
01:30:01,541 --> 01:30:02,458
That's great.

1040
01:30:03,708 --> 01:30:07,250
Fool! The day you become a businessman,

1041
01:30:07,708 --> 01:30:09,291
I'll play football.

1042
01:30:10,208 --> 01:30:13,500
<i>Friends, the new year comes</i>
<i>with new hope.</i>

1043
01:30:13,583 --> 01:30:15,875
<i>A chance for a new beginning.</i>

1044
01:30:16,125 --> 01:30:19,375
<i>-Let's welcome…</i>
-A chance for a new beginning, my foot!

1045
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:20,833
<i>Everyone, with me,</i>

1046
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:26,041
<i>-in ten, nine, eight, seven,</i>
-…nine, eight, seven,

1047
01:30:26,125 --> 01:30:29,125
-six, five, four,
-six, five, four,

1048
01:30:29,208 --> 01:30:31,416
-three, two,
<i>-In all that noise,</i>

1049
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,750
-one…
<i>-I suddenly thought of Rupa.</i>

1050
01:30:35,833 --> 01:30:37,250
<i>I started thinking…</i>

1051
01:30:38,083 --> 01:30:41,041
<i>how must she be</i>
<i>celebrating New Year's Eve.</i>

1052
01:31:22,416 --> 01:31:23,333
Rupa.

1053
01:31:33,333 --> 01:31:34,750
<i>You shouldn't go to Dubai.</i>

1054
01:31:35,666 --> 01:31:36,708
<i>Then where should I go?</i>

1055
01:31:37,791 --> 01:31:38,708
<i>Come home.</i>

1056
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:41,625
<i>Why are you so good to me, Laal?</i>

1057
01:31:43,375 --> 01:31:45,166
<i>Because you're my Rupa.</i>

1058
01:32:21,875 --> 01:32:23,041
Lost in your thoughts, Laal?

1059
01:32:24,583 --> 01:32:25,708
Happy new year!

1060
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:29,875
Happy new year, Mohammad Paaji.

1061
01:32:34,958 --> 01:32:39,083
<i>After getting discharged from the Army,</i>
<i>I went back home.</i>

1062
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:42,583
<i>Mom was very happy.</i>

1063
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:44,333
Laal.

1064
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:45,416
<i>So was I.</i>

1065
01:32:45,958 --> 01:32:46,916
Laal.

1066
01:32:47,833 --> 01:32:49,000
My son!

1067
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:55,250
<i>A short while later,</i>

1068
01:32:55,708 --> 01:32:59,375
<i>I felt like I should visit Bala's family.</i>

1069
01:33:02,541 --> 01:33:04,833
<i>So, I made a trip to Bodipalem.</i>

1070
01:33:06,625 --> 01:33:07,583
<i>Bala's village.</i>

1071
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:10,833
<i>I met his wife.</i>

1072
01:33:14,125 --> 01:33:18,291
His <i>tattaya</i> passed away.

1073
01:33:20,041 --> 01:33:20,875
<i>Tattaya?</i>

1074
01:33:21,333 --> 01:33:22,208
Grandfather.

1075
01:33:22,458 --> 01:33:23,833
Oh, his mother's father?

1076
01:33:24,208 --> 01:33:25,125
Yes.

1077
01:33:26,583 --> 01:33:29,500
And I don't know anything about tailoring.

1078
01:33:31,666 --> 01:33:33,583
See this, Mom.

1079
01:33:33,875 --> 01:33:35,250
It's lovely.

1080
01:33:39,041 --> 01:33:42,166
<i>The villagers had made</i>
<i>a memorial to Bala.</i>

1081
01:33:43,625 --> 01:33:44,916
<i>I went to pay my respects.</i>

1082
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:53,708
Look, Bala, your book.

1083
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,625
It's safe with me.

1084
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,250
I haven't forgotten my promise.

1085
01:33:58,958 --> 01:34:01,500
I have the initial investment

1086
01:34:02,166 --> 01:34:03,750
of 100,000…

1087
01:34:04,375 --> 01:34:06,458
and I've spoken to Mom for the rest.

1088
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,041
Don't you worry, my brother!

1089
01:34:11,083 --> 01:34:13,625
And guess where our factory
is being set up!

1090
01:34:15,083 --> 01:34:16,333
In Rupa's old room.

1091
01:34:28,666 --> 01:34:33,791
<i>I wrote to Rupa and Mohammad Paaji</i>
<i>that I was starting the business.</i>

1092
01:34:37,291 --> 01:34:39,541
<i>I bought three machines,</i>

1093
01:34:39,916 --> 01:34:41,083
<i>fabric,</i>

1094
01:34:41,583 --> 01:34:43,041
<i>and I hired two tailors.</i>

1095
01:34:48,833 --> 01:34:51,083
<i>I stitched 20 sets a day,</i>

1096
01:34:51,166 --> 01:34:52,875
<i>and they stitched ten each.</i>

1097
01:34:53,708 --> 01:34:56,166
<i>That's 40 sets every day.</i>

1098
01:35:09,541 --> 01:35:11,916
<i>We made 1000 sets in a month.</i>

1099
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:14,375
<i>Exactly as Bala had planned.</i>

1100
01:35:15,666 --> 01:35:17,250
<i>Bala was really smart.</i>

1101
01:35:17,625 --> 01:35:20,958
<i>Everything was working out</i>
<i>exactly as he had planned.</i>

1102
01:35:21,916 --> 01:35:25,416
<i>We enjoyed making undergarments,</i>
<i>so we just kept on making them.</i>

1103
01:35:30,166 --> 01:35:35,000
<i>However, what he had written</i>
<i>on the last page wasn't happening.</i>

1104
01:35:35,541 --> 01:35:39,125
<i>We weren't able to sell 800 sets a month.</i>

1105
01:35:40,333 --> 01:35:41,958
Son, I know to farm.

1106
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:44,833
But I have no idea about
the undergarments business.

1107
01:35:47,625 --> 01:35:50,958
<i>And then, one day, guess who turned up!</i>

1108
01:35:52,166 --> 01:35:53,208
Thank you.

1109
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:57,375
Mohammad Paaji!

1110
01:35:59,958 --> 01:36:01,041
Mohammad Paaji!

1111
01:36:03,375 --> 01:36:05,708
What brings you here?

1112
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,708
I thought I'd work on a sewing machine.

1113
01:36:08,666 --> 01:36:11,125
But Paaji, you don't have legs.

1114
01:36:12,166 --> 01:36:13,750
I know, you fool.

1115
01:36:15,125 --> 01:36:16,333
You wrote to me.

1116
01:36:17,458 --> 01:36:19,166
Bala Undergarments, right?

1117
01:36:20,458 --> 01:36:21,458
Very good.

1118
01:36:21,875 --> 01:36:23,791
-You've actually become a businessman.
-Yes!

1119
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:25,916
So, I'm here to be
your marketing manager.

1120
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,333
I'm a man of my word, Laal.

1121
01:36:29,708 --> 01:36:30,875
Where's the stock?

1122
01:36:38,916 --> 01:36:40,083
Not a single set has sold?!

1123
01:36:41,125 --> 01:36:42,250
We have sold five sets.

1124
01:36:42,791 --> 01:36:45,041
Mom bought them. For me.

1125
01:36:51,041 --> 01:36:52,958
<i>Mohammad Paaji gave me an idea.</i>

1126
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:56,375
<i>We started</i>
<i>a "Buy one, get one free" offer.</i>

1127
01:37:00,041 --> 01:37:02,416
<i>We still didn't sell anything.</i>

1128
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:06,000
<i>So, he suggested</i>
<i>a "Buy one, get two free" offer.</i>

1129
01:37:09,125 --> 01:37:10,708
<i>We still didn't sell anything,</i>

1130
01:37:10,791 --> 01:37:13,791
<i>so we tried</i>
<i>"Buy one, get three free."</i>

1131
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,791
<i>When we still didn't sell anything,</i>
<i>we stopped production.</i>

1132
01:37:47,625 --> 01:37:48,916
Oh my God!

1133
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:02,375
Give me a pen.

1134
01:38:03,625 --> 01:38:04,541
Oh, God!

1135
01:38:04,791 --> 01:38:06,125
Give me a pen.

1136
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:11,333
Woman!

1137
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,541
Our product needs a woman's name!

1138
01:38:14,166 --> 01:38:15,291
How can we do that?

1139
01:38:16,041 --> 01:38:17,833
It's a man's product.

1140
01:38:17,916 --> 01:38:19,500
What do men want, Laal?

1141
01:38:19,916 --> 01:38:21,500
Women! Write!

1142
01:38:21,708 --> 01:38:23,416
Write a woman's name!

1143
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:25,375
Write it, Laal!

1144
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:28,541
Sorry, Bala, my brother.

1145
01:38:30,666 --> 01:38:34,708
<i>I knew only one woman's name.</i>

1146
01:38:35,083 --> 01:38:38,375
<i>The sweetest name in the world.</i>

1147
01:38:38,666 --> 01:38:39,625
<i>Rupa.</i>

1148
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:44,458
Game on, Laal! Now watch!

1149
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:47,083
And then… a miracle happened.

1150
01:38:47,875 --> 01:38:50,000
Our product actually started selling.

1151
01:38:50,458 --> 01:38:51,541
Rupa Undergarments.

1152
01:38:57,333 --> 01:39:01,625
<i>And just like that, we grew</i>
<i>from three machines to nine machines.</i>

1153
01:39:03,416 --> 01:39:05,583
<i>Then we moved to a bigger place.</i>

1154
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:08,458
<i>After that to an even bigger place.</i>

1155
01:39:10,791 --> 01:39:12,916
<i>Today, we have many factories,</i>

1156
01:39:13,125 --> 01:39:15,291
<i>and our head office is in Delhi.</i>

1157
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:16,750
<i>Smile, please.</i>

1158
01:39:21,416 --> 01:39:22,875
Our product is very popular.

1159
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:26,000
Maybe you are wearing it too.

1160
01:39:26,458 --> 01:39:27,458
Yes.

1161
01:39:28,208 --> 01:39:29,083
Hold on a minute.

1162
01:39:29,708 --> 01:39:33,833
Are you saying that you are
the owner of Rupa Corporation?

1163
01:39:34,333 --> 01:39:35,250
Yes.

1164
01:39:37,125 --> 01:39:38,083
Very good.

1165
01:39:39,125 --> 01:39:42,541
Madam, we're in the company
of a millionaire.

1166
01:39:43,041 --> 01:39:45,375
In a second-class, non-AC compartment.

1167
01:39:46,958 --> 01:39:48,208
Rupa Corporation!

1168
01:39:49,875 --> 01:39:50,708
Liar!

1169
01:39:54,916 --> 01:39:57,416
What an engaging story, son.

1170
01:39:58,125 --> 01:40:00,333
And you tell it so nicely.

1171
01:40:00,541 --> 01:40:01,458
Thank you.

1172
01:40:02,416 --> 01:40:04,625
Would you like to see a photo
of Mohammad Paaji?

1173
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:06,166
Sure.

1174
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:10,750
-Here.
-Let me see it.

1175
01:40:10,833 --> 01:40:14,625
<i>-India Today</i> featured us on their cover.
-Wow.

1176
01:40:14,708 --> 01:40:15,541
Wow!

1177
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,125
Show me.

1178
01:40:17,791 --> 01:40:20,458
We won an award a few years ago.

1179
01:40:20,791 --> 01:40:22,375
Entrepreneur of the Year.

1180
01:40:23,791 --> 01:40:26,166
Isn't Mohammad Paaji
looking smart in a suit?

1181
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,125
Rupa Corporation!

1182
01:40:29,208 --> 01:40:31,000
Yes, Rupa Corporation.

1183
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:35,333
I split the profits of Rupa Corporation
into two halves.

1184
01:40:37,041 --> 01:40:38,958
Mohammad Paaji calls me a fool,

1185
01:40:39,666 --> 01:40:43,125
but every year, one-half
of the profit goes to Bala's wife.

1186
01:40:45,875 --> 01:40:46,750
-Chithra!
-Chithra!

1187
01:40:46,833 --> 01:40:50,083
-Is that in lakhs?
-No, in crores.

1188
01:40:50,375 --> 01:40:54,958
Mohammad Paaji invested
my profits in some cowshed.

1189
01:40:55,250 --> 01:41:00,375
He says I never have to worry
about money again.

1190
01:41:01,333 --> 01:41:03,083
Mohammad Paaji is a very good man.

1191
01:41:04,416 --> 01:41:08,416
After Mom, Bala, and Rupa,
he is my closest friend.

1192
01:41:19,916 --> 01:41:24,208
<i>…was heard</i>
<i>at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus.</i>

1193
01:41:24,708 --> 01:41:27,083
<i>Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists</i>

1194
01:41:27,166 --> 01:41:31,000
<i>have held the city hostage</i>
<i>with gunfire and bombings for 60 hours.</i>

1195
01:41:31,083 --> 01:41:35,583
<i>They have killed more than 175 civilians</i>

1196
01:41:35,666 --> 01:41:37,958
<i>and critically injured over 300.</i>

1197
01:41:40,708 --> 01:41:45,541
<i>Ismail Khan was killed by the police,</i>
<i>but Ajmal Kasab was captured alive.</i>

1198
01:41:45,625 --> 01:41:48,791
<i>According to sources,</i>
<i>Kasab is only 21 years old.</i>

1199
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:24,375
Laal.

1200
01:42:30,375 --> 01:42:31,916
I never thanked you…

1201
01:42:35,416 --> 01:42:36,458
for saving me.

1202
01:42:39,708 --> 01:42:40,541
Thank you, Laal.

1203
01:42:41,625 --> 01:42:42,541
Welcome, Paaji.

1204
01:42:54,916 --> 01:42:55,750
Laal.

1205
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:00,916
I've never seen you pray.

1206
01:43:02,791 --> 01:43:03,625
No rituals,

1207
01:43:04,541 --> 01:43:05,416
no offering prayers.

1208
01:43:06,458 --> 01:43:07,375
How come?

1209
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,708
My Mom says that…

1210
01:43:11,375 --> 01:43:13,375
religion sometimes causes malaria.

1211
01:43:15,125 --> 01:43:17,500
And God resides within each of us.

1212
01:43:18,416 --> 01:43:19,958
Within Mom, within me,

1213
01:43:20,875 --> 01:43:21,708
within you.

1214
01:43:53,583 --> 01:43:55,083
Mohammad Paaji, aren't you going home?

1215
01:43:58,791 --> 01:44:00,083
I was thinking the same, Laal.

1216
01:44:02,416 --> 01:44:03,750
It's time I went home.

1217
01:44:06,291 --> 01:44:08,000
I was told the enemy lives here.

1218
01:44:09,875 --> 01:44:10,833
Non-believers.

1219
01:44:13,666 --> 01:44:14,625
Then I found you.

1220
01:44:16,541 --> 01:44:18,083
I tried to kill you.

1221
01:44:20,708 --> 01:44:21,791
And you tried to save me.

1222
01:44:25,666 --> 01:44:27,041
I believed this to be an enemy country.

1223
01:44:30,125 --> 01:44:31,208
Instead, I found a friend.

1224
01:44:37,958 --> 01:44:38,958
You know, Laal…

1225
01:44:40,666 --> 01:44:42,333
I was suffering from malaria myself.

1226
01:44:45,625 --> 01:44:46,750
You saved me.

1227
01:44:49,791 --> 01:44:51,416
But malaria is still being spread there.

1228
01:44:54,291 --> 01:44:56,125
Many like me are being brainwashed.

1229
01:44:57,416 --> 01:44:58,541
Being taught to hate.

1230
01:45:02,791 --> 01:45:03,750
Laal…

1231
01:45:06,958 --> 01:45:08,916
I want to go back and start a school.

1232
01:45:12,041 --> 01:45:14,833
I want to teach children
about friends like you here.

1233
01:45:34,916 --> 01:45:38,000
Paaji, I'll write letters to you.

1234
01:45:39,708 --> 01:45:40,708
Thank you, Laal.

1235
01:45:42,041 --> 01:45:43,041
Thank you.

1236
01:45:50,083 --> 01:45:54,708
<i>And then, one day, Mohammad Paaji left.</i>

1237
01:45:56,791 --> 01:46:01,666
<i>But before leaving,</i>
<i>he hired a lot of smart people</i>

1238
01:46:01,833 --> 01:46:03,833
<i>to look after Rupa Corporation.</i>

1239
01:46:03,916 --> 01:46:04,833
Good morning, sir.

1240
01:46:11,333 --> 01:46:13,791
<i>Along with Bala and Rupa,</i>

1241
01:46:13,875 --> 01:46:17,750
<i>I now started missing Mohammad Paaji too.</i>

1242
01:46:24,208 --> 01:46:26,416
-Hello.
<i>-Sir, it's Bahadur. I'm calling from home.</i>

1243
01:46:26,541 --> 01:46:29,458
<i>Mom is really unwell.</i>
<i>Please come quickly.</i>

1244
01:46:52,208 --> 01:46:53,041
Laal.

1245
01:46:54,375 --> 01:46:56,166
Come, sit.

1246
01:47:03,958 --> 01:47:04,875
Laal.

1247
01:47:06,333 --> 01:47:07,208
What happened, Mom?

1248
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:09,500
Nothing, son.

1249
01:47:11,916 --> 01:47:13,125
It's just time for me to go.

1250
01:47:15,041 --> 01:47:16,041
Why are you going?

1251
01:47:17,875 --> 01:47:20,208
Because my time here is over, Laal.

1252
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:24,541
There's no need to worry.

1253
01:47:25,583 --> 01:47:27,375
Everyone has to leave someday.

1254
01:47:29,041 --> 01:47:31,458
This is completely natural.

1255
01:47:33,208 --> 01:47:35,458
Death is also a part of life.

1256
01:47:38,833 --> 01:47:42,041
I was lucky to have you in my life.

1257
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:48,041
But this is where
we are meant to part ways.

1258
01:47:51,166 --> 01:47:53,333
I did my best.

1259
01:47:54,916 --> 01:47:56,041
I got some things right.

1260
01:47:57,083 --> 01:47:58,500
Maybe I even got some things wrong.

1261
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:02,708
Please don't go.

1262
01:48:03,916 --> 01:48:04,833
Don't go, Mom.

1263
01:48:10,291 --> 01:48:11,208
I wish.

1264
01:48:14,041 --> 01:48:16,625
Life is like <i>golgappas</i>, Laal.

1265
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:20,833
Your tummy may be full…

1266
01:48:23,166 --> 01:48:24,625
but your heart always craves more.

1267
01:48:28,916 --> 01:48:30,750
Look after yourself, okay?

1268
01:48:37,125 --> 01:48:38,458
<i>Mom had cancer.</i>

1269
01:48:41,416 --> 01:48:44,166
She died on a Thursday.

1270
01:48:56,083 --> 01:48:58,166
Mom used to say…

1271
01:48:58,666 --> 01:49:02,541
"The Lord wants you
to keep only what you need

1272
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:07,000
and give the rest to those in need."

1273
01:49:07,666 --> 01:49:11,416
<i>So, I built a hospital in Mom's name.</i>

1274
01:49:12,791 --> 01:49:16,083
<i>Our family doctor takes care of it.</i>

1275
01:49:17,166 --> 01:49:19,791
<i>There, everyone is treated free of cost.</i>

1276
01:49:23,291 --> 01:49:27,416
<i>After my mom's death, there was</i>
<i>no one to take care of the farm.</i>

1277
01:49:28,166 --> 01:49:31,250
<i>If I had gone back to the factory,</i>

1278
01:49:31,958 --> 01:49:34,875
<i>what would have become</i>
<i>of the farm workers?</i>

1279
01:49:36,166 --> 01:49:38,333
<i>So, I didn't go back.</i>

1280
01:49:38,916 --> 01:49:41,041
<i>I started farming.</i>

1281
01:49:44,208 --> 01:49:45,250
<i>During the day,</i>

1282
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,375
<i>work would keep me busy.</i>

1283
01:49:50,333 --> 01:49:52,333
<i>But as night would fall,</i>

1284
01:49:53,541 --> 01:49:55,166
<i>memories of Rupa would torment me.</i>

1285
01:50:01,083 --> 01:50:04,083
<i>It had been many years</i>
<i>since I had seen Rupa.</i>

1286
01:50:06,958 --> 01:50:08,750
<i>I missed her terribly.</i>

1287
01:51:31,833 --> 01:51:32,750
Rupa!

1288
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:45,541
<i>And then, one day, she came back.</i>

1289
01:51:47,750 --> 01:51:48,708
<i>Just like that!</i>

1290
01:51:50,625 --> 01:51:53,416
<i>I cleaned up Mom's room for her.</i>

1291
01:51:54,625 --> 01:51:57,083
<i>I think she was very tired.</i>

1292
01:51:59,666 --> 01:52:02,000
<i>For the first few days,</i>
<i>all she did was sleep…</i>

1293
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:04,125
<i>all day, all night.</i>

1294
01:52:05,583 --> 01:52:07,625
<i>I told her everything.</i>

1295
01:52:08,083 --> 01:52:12,708
<i>Bala, Mohammad Paaji,</i>
<i>the factory, and Rupa Corporation.</i>

1296
01:52:16,541 --> 01:52:21,166
<i>I told her that she need not worry</i>
<i>about money anymore.</i>

1297
01:52:22,625 --> 01:52:25,583
<i>I could give her all she wanted.</i>

1298
01:52:27,583 --> 01:52:30,541
<i>But she didn't seem to care</i>
<i>about money anymore.</i>

1299
01:52:31,458 --> 01:52:34,333
<i>She remained quiet most of the time.</i>

1300
01:52:37,958 --> 01:52:41,166
<i>Except once, when our</i>
<i>home help was drunk</i>

1301
01:52:41,250 --> 01:52:42,666
<i>and was beating his wife…</i>

1302
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:46,083
<i>she got angry.</i>

1303
01:52:46,625 --> 01:52:50,291
<i>She beat him</i>
<i>and then started crying herself.</i>

1304
01:52:51,458 --> 01:52:52,416
<i>For very long.</i>

1305
01:52:52,833 --> 01:52:55,125
Rupa, that's enough. Stop it.

1306
01:52:56,791 --> 01:52:57,666
Enough.

1307
01:53:21,291 --> 01:53:22,708
It's okay, Rupa.

1308
01:53:51,791 --> 01:53:55,333
<i>And then, one day, Rupa smiled.</i>

1309
01:54:03,875 --> 01:54:06,750
<i>We used to work together in the fields.</i>

1310
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:10,291
<i>We were together all the time.</i>

1311
01:54:10,541 --> 01:54:12,375
<i>Just like carrots and peas.</i>

1312
01:54:33,875 --> 01:54:37,375
<i>I had got back my magician…</i>

1313
01:54:38,291 --> 01:54:41,666
<i>who could pluck out a plane</i>
<i>from the sky and stuff it in her pocket.</i>

1314
01:54:46,541 --> 01:54:49,041
<i>She taught me to dance.</i>

1315
01:54:53,625 --> 01:54:57,833
<i>It felt like the two of us were a family.</i>

1316
01:54:58,875 --> 01:55:01,041
<i>She was the mother,</i>
<i>and I was the father.</i>

1317
01:55:05,416 --> 01:55:08,166
<i>I have never felt such joy in my life.</i>

1318
01:55:15,375 --> 01:55:20,583
<i>That year, on Diwali,</i>
<i>she gave me the best gift.</i>

1319
01:55:22,375 --> 01:55:23,375
Shoes.

1320
01:55:36,375 --> 01:55:38,333
<i>And that night…</i>

1321
01:55:53,583 --> 01:55:54,416
Rupa…

1322
01:55:55,875 --> 01:55:57,208
will you marry me?

1323
01:56:00,958 --> 01:56:02,458
I'll take very good care of you.

1324
01:56:05,375 --> 01:56:06,208
I know, Laal.

1325
01:56:12,166 --> 01:56:14,083
But you won't marry me.

1326
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,208
Because I'm not smart.

1327
01:56:19,875 --> 01:56:21,750
I'm stupid. Isn't that it?

1328
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:24,833
No, Laal. It's not that.

1329
01:56:26,875 --> 01:56:28,708
I can't marry you because--

1330
01:56:35,750 --> 01:56:37,250
Because I can't be relied upon.

1331
01:56:45,958 --> 01:56:46,875
I may not be smart,

1332
01:56:48,875 --> 01:56:49,750
but I…

1333
01:56:51,583 --> 01:56:53,041
I know what love is.

1334
01:56:56,583 --> 01:56:57,416
Laal.

1335
01:57:36,041 --> 01:57:36,916
Laal…

1336
01:57:39,041 --> 01:57:40,625
I love you…

1337
01:57:44,291 --> 01:57:45,625
very much.

1338
01:57:48,208 --> 01:57:49,125
That's the truth.

1339
01:59:21,666 --> 01:59:22,666
I'm here.

1340
01:59:23,375 --> 01:59:24,375
Don't wake him.

1341
01:59:25,833 --> 01:59:26,708
Let's go.

1342
02:00:30,583 --> 02:00:33,583
<i>Here one moment</i>

1343
02:00:34,958 --> 02:00:37,208
<i>Gone the next</i>

1344
02:00:38,916 --> 02:00:43,166
<i>You've been mine</i>

1345
02:00:43,333 --> 02:00:46,500
<i>Only in fragments</i>

1346
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:52,000
<i>My life's story</i>

1347
02:00:52,583 --> 02:00:55,500
<i>Has many chapters</i>

1348
02:00:56,416 --> 02:01:00,916
<i>You are a part</i>

1349
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,625
<i>Of every one of them</i>

1350
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:25,791
<i>I started running.</i>

1351
02:01:26,625 --> 02:01:30,041
<i>I'm not sure why.</i>
<i>I just felt like running.</i>

1352
02:01:31,375 --> 02:01:32,708
<i>I ran to the main road.</i>

1353
02:01:33,875 --> 02:01:35,958
<i>Then I thought I'd run to the market.</i>

1354
02:01:37,333 --> 02:01:41,041
<i>I reached the market</i>
<i>and thought I'd run to the city.</i>

1355
02:01:43,166 --> 02:01:48,875
<i>After crossing the city,</i>
<i>I thought, "Let me run some more."</i>

1356
02:01:49,750 --> 02:01:52,375
<i>I ran so far ahead…</i>

1357
02:01:52,875 --> 02:01:54,625
<i>that I had covered half the state.</i>

1358
02:01:55,416 --> 02:01:58,416
<i>So, I thought I might as well</i>
<i>run across all of it.</i>

1359
02:01:59,583 --> 02:02:01,583
<i>I didn't feel like stopping.</i>

1360
02:02:02,708 --> 02:02:07,833
<i>From that day onward, I kept running.</i>

1361
02:02:08,666 --> 02:02:09,541
<i>I kept running.</i>

1362
02:02:12,333 --> 02:02:15,875
-Anna Hazare! We are with you!
-Anna Hazare! We are with you!

1363
02:02:16,041 --> 02:02:19,791
-Anna Hazare! We are with you!
-Anna Hazare! We are with you!

1364
02:02:19,875 --> 02:02:22,333
Here, at the Ram Leela Ground,

1365
02:02:22,416 --> 02:02:25,791
Anna Hazare has been
on a hunger strike for the past 12 days,

1366
02:02:25,875 --> 02:02:28,625
pushing for the anti-corruption
Jan Lokpal Bill,

1367
02:02:28,708 --> 02:02:30,208
with massive citizen support.

1368
02:02:30,291 --> 02:02:32,583
Hey! Who's this guy? Such an idiot!

1369
02:02:32,666 --> 02:02:35,875
Who was that?
Why didn't you stop him? Fool!

1370
02:02:35,958 --> 02:02:37,708
-Hail Anna Hazare!
-Hail Anna Hazare!

1371
02:02:37,791 --> 02:02:40,541
We've just heard that Anna Hazare
has ended his hunger strike.

1372
02:02:51,583 --> 02:02:53,125
<i>I reached the sea and turned around.</i>

1373
02:02:57,791 --> 02:02:59,791
<i>Then I reached another sea.</i>

1374
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:01,500
<i>Again, I turned around.</i>

1375
02:03:09,041 --> 02:03:10,125
<i>When I reached the mountains,</i>

1376
02:03:11,041 --> 02:03:12,041
<i>I turned around.</i>

1377
02:03:14,208 --> 02:03:16,000
<i>I just kept running.</i>

1378
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:21,166
<i>Welcome to</i> Samaj Sanchar!
<i>First, let's hear today's breaking news!</i>

1379
02:03:21,750 --> 02:03:25,708
<i>The police have captured</i>
<i>underworld don Abbas Haji in Malaysia.</i>

1380
02:03:26,208 --> 02:03:28,500
<i>Let me remind you that a few months ago,</i>

1381
02:03:28,583 --> 02:03:31,416
<i>Abbas Haji's girlfriend,</i>

1382
02:03:31,750 --> 02:03:34,958
<i>Rupa D'Souza was arrested</i>
<i>from a small village in Punjab.</i>

1383
02:03:35,458 --> 02:03:39,583
<i>With the information she provided,</i>
<i>Abbas has been arrested today.</i>

1384
02:03:44,958 --> 02:03:46,250
I thought a lot…

1385
02:03:48,208 --> 02:03:49,291
about Mom,

1386
02:03:50,541 --> 02:03:53,166
Bala, Mohammad Paaji…

1387
02:03:56,166 --> 02:03:57,333
but mostly…

1388
02:03:59,583 --> 02:04:00,541
about Rupa.

1389
02:04:03,083 --> 02:04:05,625
<i>You are the seeker</i>

1390
02:04:05,875 --> 02:04:08,500
<i>You are also the messiah</i>

1391
02:04:08,750 --> 02:04:14,250
<i>You are the circus</i>

1392
02:04:14,333 --> 02:04:16,666
<i>And also the ringmaster</i>

1393
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,291
<i>You wander in vain</i>

1394
02:04:22,875 --> 02:04:25,375
<i>In shrines and temples</i>

1395
02:04:25,708 --> 02:04:30,875
<i>The one that you seek</i>

1396
02:04:31,375 --> 02:04:33,708
<i>Is within you</i>

1397
02:04:37,625 --> 02:04:42,916
<i>Why do you torment yourself?</i>

1398
02:04:43,291 --> 02:04:48,166
<i>Didn't the pain of separation scar you?</i>

1399
02:04:48,250 --> 02:04:53,125
<i>Walk alone, O crazy one, walk alone</i>

1400
02:04:53,916 --> 02:04:58,666
<i>Leave the streets of sadness behind</i>
<i>Walk alone</i>

1401
02:04:59,375 --> 02:05:04,333
<i>Walk alone, O crazy one, walk alone</i>

1402
02:05:05,208 --> 02:05:10,000
<i>Leave the streets of sadness behind</i>
<i>Walk alone</i>

1403
02:05:10,875 --> 02:05:15,708
<i>Walk alone</i>

1404
02:05:16,458 --> 02:05:20,875
<i>Walk alone</i>

1405
02:05:22,166 --> 02:05:26,375
<i>Walk alone</i>

1406
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:28,583
<i>Walk alone</i>

1407
02:05:28,666 --> 02:05:33,250
<i>Welcome to</i> Samaj Sanchar!
<i>Let's hear today's breaking news!</i>

1408
02:05:33,333 --> 02:05:35,416
<i>The Mumbai High Court</i>
<i>has given its verdict</i>

1409
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:37,750
<i>on the Abbas Haji and Rupa D'Souza case.</i>

1410
02:05:37,833 --> 02:05:42,166
<i>Abbas Haji was arrested</i>
<i>with the help of model Rupa D'Souza.</i>

1411
02:05:42,250 --> 02:05:46,166
<i>Abbas Haji gets a life sentence</i>
<i>for five murders,</i>

1412
02:05:46,250 --> 02:05:50,291
<i>and considering her role as the approver,</i>

1413
02:05:50,541 --> 02:05:52,625
<i>Rupa D'Souza is sentenced</i>
<i>to only six months.</i>

1414
02:05:53,125 --> 02:05:57,666
Now, let's meet a strange man
who's been running across the country.

1415
02:05:57,791 --> 02:05:59,791
Mr. Laal Singh,
are you running for world peace?

1416
02:05:59,875 --> 02:06:01,625
Are you running for women's rights?

1417
02:06:01,708 --> 02:06:03,791
Are you running for the environment?

1418
02:06:04,666 --> 02:06:08,791
<i>One day, some TV reporters</i>
<i>started filming me.</i>

1419
02:06:12,125 --> 02:06:16,416
Sir! It's you!

1420
02:06:16,916 --> 02:06:19,208
I saw you running on TV.

1421
02:06:19,541 --> 02:06:23,625
I told my wife, "This guy is special."

1422
02:06:24,041 --> 02:06:27,875
Sir, I told her that you know everything.

1423
02:06:27,958 --> 02:06:33,083
Sir, I want to run with you
wherever you go.

1424
02:06:33,833 --> 02:06:37,541
<i>So, this guy started running with me.</i>

1425
02:06:38,583 --> 02:06:41,416
<i>Then some more people joined me.</i>

1426
02:06:43,208 --> 02:06:44,416
<i>And then some more.</i>

1427
02:06:46,333 --> 02:06:50,750
<i>They said that I gave them hope.</i>

1428
02:06:52,208 --> 02:06:54,041
Well, I don't know about that.

1429
02:06:54,333 --> 02:06:56,250
I was just running.

1430
02:06:56,541 --> 02:06:59,666
<i>Take it for the truth</i>

1431
02:06:59,958 --> 02:07:02,458
<i>A true lover is the one</i>

1432
02:07:02,875 --> 02:07:07,166
<i>Who can set their beloved free</i>

1433
02:07:08,541 --> 02:07:13,833
<i>The lover who can seek blessings</i>

1434
02:07:14,166 --> 02:07:19,333
<i>-For the one who broke their heart</i>
<i>-For the one who broke their heart</i>

1435
02:07:19,875 --> 02:07:24,791
<i>A single teardrop of such a lover</i>

1436
02:07:25,541 --> 02:07:30,291
<i>Would cause even a desert to bloom</i>

1437
02:07:30,375 --> 02:07:35,583
<i>Walk alone, O crazy one, walk alone</i>

1438
02:07:36,041 --> 02:07:40,666
<i>Leave the streets of sadness behind</i>
<i>Walk alone</i>

1439
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:47,333
<i>Your love is wild and carefree</i>

1440
02:07:47,416 --> 02:07:53,000
<i>Break free of your cage and fly</i>

1441
02:07:53,083 --> 02:07:58,583
<i>The horizon where earth and sky meet</i>
<i>Beyond the fiery sunset</i>

1442
02:07:58,666 --> 02:08:04,500
<i>That is your destination, O traveler</i>

1443
02:08:04,583 --> 02:08:09,083
<i>Walk alone, O crazy one, walk alone</i>

1444
02:08:09,375 --> 02:08:13,458
<i>Mom used to say,</i>
<i>"The past is best left behind."</i>

1445
02:08:15,083 --> 02:08:17,666
<i>Maybe that's why I was running.</i>

1446
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:30,958
<i>I ran for four years, seven months,</i>
<i>two weeks, and three days.</i>

1447
02:08:41,208 --> 02:08:42,250
He's stopped.

1448
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,208
Maybe he'll say something.

1449
02:08:50,833 --> 02:08:52,958
Quiet!

1450
02:08:53,041 --> 02:08:54,500
Mr. Laal Singh is going to speak.

1451
02:08:57,291 --> 02:08:58,958
Mr. Laal Singh, why have you stopped?

1452
02:09:03,333 --> 02:09:04,291
I'm tired.

1453
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:07,708
I'm going back home.

1454
02:09:21,416 --> 02:09:22,791
Hey, turn around.

1455
02:09:22,916 --> 02:09:25,791
As you just saw,

1456
02:09:25,875 --> 02:09:27,458
<i>Mr. Laal Singh is tired.</i>

1457
02:09:27,666 --> 02:09:29,583
<i>He's going back home.</i>

1458
02:09:29,791 --> 02:09:32,083
<i>Stay tuned for stories like this…</i>

1459
02:09:32,166 --> 02:09:33,541
What a crazy fellow!

1460
02:09:34,791 --> 02:09:35,916
He isn't crazy.

1461
02:09:47,333 --> 02:09:52,083
<i>I started to look a bit like my grandpas.</i>

1462
02:09:53,333 --> 02:09:54,666
<i>It made me happy.</i>

1463
02:10:10,458 --> 02:10:14,125
<i>He is the one Lord</i>
<i>The eternal truth</i>

1464
02:10:14,500 --> 02:10:16,458
<i>The creator and doer</i>

1465
02:10:16,958 --> 02:10:20,625
<i>Devoid of fear or enmity</i>

1466
02:10:20,708 --> 02:10:22,875
<i>Omnipresent</i>

1467
02:10:23,333 --> 02:10:27,041
<i>He's unborn, self-existent</i>

1468
02:10:27,375 --> 02:10:29,583
<i>Attained by the Guru's grace</i>

1469
02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:31,208
<i>Chant…</i>

1470
02:10:31,291 --> 02:10:34,708
<i>The primal truth</i>
<i>The truth through the ages</i>

1471
02:10:34,791 --> 02:10:41,291
<i>The present truth</i>
<i>O Nanak, forever true</i>

1472
02:10:42,083 --> 02:10:48,041
<i>You can't fathom Him, no matter how much</i>
<i>You ponder over Him</i>

1473
02:10:48,416 --> 02:10:54,583
<i>You may focus on Him</i>
<i>But you can't attain the perfect silence</i>

1474
02:10:54,666 --> 02:10:59,958
<i>All the material pleasures of the world</i>

1475
02:11:00,166 --> 02:11:03,375
<i>Will not satiate your hunger</i>

1476
02:11:03,458 --> 02:11:06,500
<i>However wise you may be</i>

1477
02:11:06,750 --> 02:11:09,791
<i>You take nothing with you in the end</i>

1478
02:11:10,250 --> 02:11:15,333
<i>How to attain the Truth?</i>

1479
02:11:15,416 --> 02:11:18,958
<i>How to rip apart this veil of delusion?</i>

1480
02:11:19,083 --> 02:11:21,791
<i>Nanak writes that only</i>

1481
02:11:21,875 --> 02:11:27,291
<i>His will can carry you through</i>

1482
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:30,875
Sir…

1483
02:11:31,708 --> 02:11:34,416
when you were out,
these letters came from Ms. Rupa.

1484
02:11:35,708 --> 02:11:37,458
She even called many times.

1485
02:11:39,625 --> 02:11:43,833
Look, these are Rupa's letters.
She's called me to Chandigarh.

1486
02:11:43,916 --> 02:11:44,958
Wow!

1487
02:11:45,583 --> 02:11:49,125
-She saw me running on TV.
-Very good.

1488
02:11:49,208 --> 02:11:50,958
Uncle, Chandigarh has arrived.

1489
02:11:52,291 --> 02:11:55,041
-Gosh!
-Take this.

1490
02:11:55,166 --> 02:11:56,083
Please move.

1491
02:11:56,166 --> 02:11:58,291
-Bye.
-Bye.

1492
02:11:58,583 --> 02:11:59,458
Good luck!

1493
02:12:00,333 --> 02:12:02,500
-Bless me.
-God bless you.

1494
02:12:02,583 --> 02:12:04,041
-I'll take your leave. Bye.
-Bye!

1495
02:12:04,125 --> 02:12:06,166
-Bye, Uncle.
-Give my regards to Rupa!

1496
02:12:06,250 --> 02:12:09,291
-Bye!
-Bye! All the best!

1497
02:12:17,208 --> 02:12:19,875
CLEAN RAIL, CLEAN INDIA
ONE STEP TOWARD CLEANLINESS

1498
02:12:25,416 --> 02:12:26,416
Laal.

1499
02:12:28,083 --> 02:12:29,083
Hi!

1500
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:30,333
Hello.

1501
02:12:30,916 --> 02:12:33,291
When did you start wearing a turban?

1502
02:12:34,458 --> 02:12:35,583
You're looking so good.

1503
02:12:38,458 --> 02:12:39,375
Come in.

1504
02:12:49,166 --> 02:12:52,750
I've got <i>golgappas</i> for you.

1505
02:12:55,333 --> 02:12:59,500
I ate a few on the way though.
I was hungry.

1506
02:13:00,708 --> 02:13:01,625
That's okay.

1507
02:13:01,875 --> 02:13:02,791
And…

1508
02:13:06,250 --> 02:13:09,458
I got the spiced water separately.

1509
02:13:13,250 --> 02:13:14,083
Have a seat.

1510
02:13:21,583 --> 02:13:23,083
Isn't this from Delhi?

1511
02:13:24,583 --> 02:13:25,416
Yes.

1512
02:13:29,625 --> 02:13:32,291
I saw you running on TV.

1513
02:13:34,041 --> 02:13:36,000
Yes, I ran a lot.

1514
02:13:36,958 --> 02:13:37,791
Me too.

1515
02:13:43,083 --> 02:13:43,916
Laal…

1516
02:13:45,291 --> 02:13:47,166
I feel like I've treated you badly.

1517
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:49,291
Very badly.

1518
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:51,833
But…

1519
02:13:53,750 --> 02:13:56,375
I treated myself even worse.

1520
02:13:59,208 --> 02:14:00,166
Everything was wrong.

1521
02:14:01,166 --> 02:14:02,333
But now, it's all right.

1522
02:14:02,958 --> 02:14:03,833
Mom.

1523
02:14:04,541 --> 02:14:05,708
You're up, son?

1524
02:14:06,458 --> 02:14:07,333
Come here.

1525
02:14:14,291 --> 02:14:17,000
Meet my best friend.

1526
02:14:18,666 --> 02:14:19,541
Say hello.

1527
02:14:19,666 --> 02:14:20,875
Hello, Uncle.

1528
02:14:24,125 --> 02:14:25,000
Hello.

1529
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,791
Mom, can I watch cartoons?

1530
02:14:29,083 --> 02:14:29,916
Yes, go.

1531
02:14:41,166 --> 02:14:42,583
You've become a mother?!

1532
02:14:43,833 --> 02:14:46,083
Yes, I've become a mother.

1533
02:14:50,250 --> 02:14:51,125
What's his name?

1534
02:14:52,958 --> 02:14:53,875
Aman.

1535
02:14:55,125 --> 02:14:56,083
Aman Chaddha.

1536
02:14:57,791 --> 02:14:58,791
He's also a Chaddha?!

1537
02:15:00,500 --> 02:15:03,583
Yes, because his father is a Chaddha.

1538
02:15:06,458 --> 02:15:07,500
Laal Singh Chaddha.

1539
02:15:10,708 --> 02:15:12,583
His father's name is also
Laal Singh Chaddha?!

1540
02:15:14,125 --> 02:15:15,041
Laal…

1541
02:15:18,250 --> 02:15:19,416
you are his father.

1542
02:15:35,500 --> 02:15:38,625
Laal, listen to me.

1543
02:15:38,916 --> 02:15:40,250
Relax, Laal.

1544
02:15:40,583 --> 02:15:42,708
You didn't do anything wrong, Laal.

1545
02:15:43,625 --> 02:15:45,458
Laal, look at me.

1546
02:15:46,666 --> 02:15:47,625
Look at me.

1547
02:15:50,333 --> 02:15:51,375
It's all good.

1548
02:15:53,416 --> 02:15:54,375
Okay?

1549
02:15:59,875 --> 02:16:01,000
Isn't he the cutest?

1550
02:16:07,208 --> 02:16:08,875
Yes, he is.

1551
02:16:10,375 --> 02:16:11,416
Just adorable.

1552
02:16:16,625 --> 02:16:19,958
But is he smart, or…

1553
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:22,666
-is he like me--
-Laal…

1554
02:16:23,708 --> 02:16:24,833
He's very smart.

1555
02:16:25,500 --> 02:16:27,125
The brightest in his class.

1556
02:16:36,915 --> 02:16:38,500
Can I…

1557
02:16:40,125 --> 02:16:43,000
can I go to him?

1558
02:16:43,250 --> 02:16:44,958
Of course. Go.

1559
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:48,958
Go.

1560
02:17:43,375 --> 02:17:44,250
Laal…

1561
02:17:46,875 --> 02:17:47,790
I'm sick.

1562
02:17:49,583 --> 02:17:50,540
What happened?

1563
02:17:51,333 --> 02:17:52,208
I don't know.

1564
02:17:52,915 --> 02:17:54,415
The doctors haven't diagnosed it yet.

1565
02:17:56,208 --> 02:17:57,208
Come home with me.

1566
02:17:57,665 --> 02:17:58,625
I'll take care of you.

1567
02:18:07,708 --> 02:18:08,540
Laal…

1568
02:18:12,250 --> 02:18:13,333
will you marry me?

1569
02:18:43,458 --> 02:18:47,290
<i>I am colored now, forever</i>

1570
02:18:48,040 --> 02:18:55,040
<i>In the color of your love</i>

1571
02:18:57,083 --> 02:19:00,750
<i>In our union</i>

1572
02:19:01,165 --> 02:19:06,208
<i>Two souls</i>

1573
02:19:06,790 --> 02:19:10,958
<i>Have become one</i>

1574
02:19:11,665 --> 02:19:15,125
<i>I found God</i>

1575
02:19:15,290 --> 02:19:18,708
<i>When I found you</i>

1576
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:25,958
<i>By my side</i>

1577
02:19:42,958 --> 02:19:47,165
<i>Even though you weren't by my side</i>

1578
02:19:47,458 --> 02:19:51,375
<i>You were with me every moment</i>

1579
02:19:51,958 --> 02:19:56,250
<i>To be with you</i>

1580
02:19:56,333 --> 02:20:00,541
<i>I would wait an eternity</i>

1581
02:20:09,625 --> 02:20:13,791
<i>Even though you weren't by my side</i>

1582
02:20:14,166 --> 02:20:17,833
<i>You were with me every moment</i>

1583
02:20:18,625 --> 02:20:22,750
<i>To be with you</i>

1584
02:20:23,041 --> 02:20:27,083
<i>I would wait an eternity</i>

1585
02:20:27,166 --> 02:20:32,000
<i>All that I have</i>

1586
02:20:32,458 --> 02:20:35,541
<i>I surrender to you</i>

1587
02:20:35,916 --> 02:20:41,041
<i>Every atom of my being</i>

1588
02:20:41,416 --> 02:20:44,708
<i>Is yours</i>

1589
02:20:44,791 --> 02:20:49,791
<i>All that I have</i>

1590
02:20:50,291 --> 02:20:53,208
<i>I surrender to you</i>

1591
02:20:53,625 --> 02:20:58,625
<i>Every atom of my being</i>

1592
02:20:59,083 --> 02:21:02,500
<i>Is yours</i>

1593
02:22:21,416 --> 02:22:25,375
<i>I am colored now, forever</i>

1594
02:22:26,041 --> 02:22:32,916
<i>In the color of your love</i>

1595
02:22:35,166 --> 02:22:38,875
<i>In our union</i>

1596
02:22:39,416 --> 02:22:44,708
<i>Two souls</i>

1597
02:22:45,250 --> 02:22:48,416
<i>Have become one</i>

1598
02:22:49,375 --> 02:22:52,708
<i>I found God</i>

1599
02:22:52,791 --> 02:22:57,125
<i>When I found you</i>

1600
02:22:57,208 --> 02:23:04,208
<i>By my side</i>

1601
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:09,916
Laal,

1602
02:23:11,083 --> 02:23:15,041
were you scared when you were in Kargil?

1603
02:23:20,291 --> 02:23:21,291
Yes.

1604
02:23:24,291 --> 02:23:25,291
But at night,

1605
02:23:25,916 --> 02:23:28,541
when the Himalayas would glow,

1606
02:23:30,333 --> 02:23:32,083
I would feel really nice.

1607
02:23:38,166 --> 02:23:40,500
And in Kanyakumari,

1608
02:23:41,458 --> 02:23:44,541
when I saw the sunset…

1609
02:23:46,125 --> 02:23:51,041
it looked like a million stars
were twinkling in the ocean.

1610
02:23:55,291 --> 02:23:57,875
When I was running in Ladakh,

1611
02:23:58,625 --> 02:24:02,375
it felt like there were two skies.

1612
02:24:09,666 --> 02:24:12,625
And in the twilight of the desert…

1613
02:24:14,208 --> 02:24:16,583
as I was counting the stars…

1614
02:24:17,833 --> 02:24:20,541
I forgot who I was,
and what I was doing there.

1615
02:24:22,958 --> 02:24:25,958
It was so serene and peaceful.

1616
02:24:30,250 --> 02:24:32,250
I wish I had been there with you then.

1617
02:24:36,583 --> 02:24:37,500
You were there…

1618
02:24:39,375 --> 02:24:40,250
with me.

1619
02:24:45,583 --> 02:24:46,708
I love you, Laal.

1620
02:25:11,750 --> 02:25:13,083
Today's your death anniversary.

1621
02:25:22,666 --> 02:25:23,500
How are you?

1622
02:25:26,250 --> 02:25:27,208
I'm fine.

1623
02:25:28,500 --> 02:25:29,500
Aman's also fine.

1624
02:25:31,291 --> 02:25:33,041
He's such a good kid.

1625
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,708
He does all his work on his own.

1626
02:25:40,625 --> 02:25:43,208
He's going to start school from tomorrow.

1627
02:25:44,583 --> 02:25:46,166
Our old school.

1628
02:25:50,416 --> 02:25:52,083
I'm teaching him to play table tennis.

1629
02:25:54,333 --> 02:25:55,750
And to sew.

1630
02:25:57,541 --> 02:25:58,541
If you were here,

1631
02:25:59,250 --> 02:26:00,916
you'd have taught him
to catch airplanes.

1632
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:08,291
He reads me stories.

1633
02:26:09,625 --> 02:26:10,583
He's very smart.

1634
02:26:16,458 --> 02:26:18,416
He's written you a letter.

1635
02:26:20,083 --> 02:26:21,333
I'm not allowed to read it.

1636
02:26:22,666 --> 02:26:23,583
You read it…

1637
02:26:24,708 --> 02:26:25,666
later.

1638
02:26:31,666 --> 02:26:35,083
He misses you a lot.

1639
02:26:38,083 --> 02:26:38,916
I do too.

1640
02:26:47,833 --> 02:26:49,000
Mom used to say,

1641
02:26:50,458 --> 02:26:52,708
"Each of us has our own destiny."

1642
02:26:54,875 --> 02:26:57,208
Mohammad Paaji too says…

1643
02:26:58,375 --> 02:26:59,875
that everything is predestined.

1644
02:27:02,916 --> 02:27:03,833
I don't know…

1645
02:27:04,958 --> 02:27:06,291
where all this is written,

1646
02:27:07,875 --> 02:27:08,875
who wrote it,

1647
02:27:10,375 --> 02:27:12,625
or why it is written in the first place.

1648
02:27:16,583 --> 02:27:17,666
Whatever happens,

1649
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:19,875
is it in our control?

1650
02:27:21,083 --> 02:27:24,166
Or are we just drifting in the wind…

1651
02:27:24,875 --> 02:27:25,875
blown from here to there?

1652
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:29,916
I have no idea.

1653
02:27:34,708 --> 02:27:37,500
Perhaps a bit of both.

1654
02:27:41,625 --> 02:27:43,833
Had you been here,
you would've explained it to me.

1655
02:27:48,625 --> 02:27:49,541
I…

1656
02:27:56,250 --> 02:28:00,416
I miss you, Rupa.

1657
02:28:03,333 --> 02:28:04,500
I really miss you.

1658
02:28:34,458 --> 02:28:36,750
Son, you have to work very hard.

1659
02:28:37,666 --> 02:28:40,791
You have to do better than your best.

1660
02:28:40,875 --> 02:28:41,916
Yes, Dad.

1661
02:28:43,041 --> 02:28:45,166
-Shall I go?
-Yes, Dad.

1662
02:28:46,333 --> 02:28:48,000
-Sure?
-Yes, Dad.

1663
02:28:51,708 --> 02:28:53,958
Okay, I'll come to get you in the evening.

1664
02:28:54,166 --> 02:28:56,125
-Bye-bye, Dad.
-Bye.

1665
02:28:57,791 --> 02:28:59,666
-Aman.
-Yes, Dad?

1666
02:29:00,250 --> 02:29:02,291
-I love you, my son.
-I love you, Dad.

1667
02:29:09,541 --> 02:29:10,458
Off you go.

1668
02:30:21,125 --> 02:30:27,125
<i>Do the lines on your palm</i>
<i>Determine your fate?</i>

1669
02:30:28,291 --> 02:30:34,208
<i>Or do you mold your destiny</i>
<i>With your own hands?</i>

1670
02:30:35,541 --> 02:30:41,500
<i>Are we smart enough to understand life?</i>

1671
02:30:42,625 --> 02:30:49,041
<i>Or is it wiser not to?</i>
