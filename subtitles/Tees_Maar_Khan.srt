1
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:03,590
'Every era has a messiah..'

2
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,533
'..who rules the
hearts of the people.'

3
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:09,002
'..who shows them
a new way of life.'

4
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,465
'..who showers them with happiness.'

5
00:02:12,775 --> 00:02:17,610
'This story is not
about such a messiah.'

6
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:28,957
Dear, you're a policeman's wife.

7
00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:32,658
ls it okay to watch these
heist movies all the time?

8
00:02:32,762 --> 00:02:34,423
Yes. l like them.

9
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:35,658
Dear, just think about it.

10
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:37,756
lf you watch such
movies in this condition..

11
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:40,530
..then what effect
will it have on our baby?

12
00:02:40,603 --> 00:02:42,571
He'll be born a thief.

13
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:45,530
The way Abhimanyu learnt
everything about archery..

14
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:46,905
..while in his mother's womb.

15
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,941
Be quiet, you drunkard.

16
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:52,538
My son won't be a thief.
He'll be a very big man.

17
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:55,478
People will die to
have just one look at him.

18
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:57,416
And the moment they see him,
they'll inform the police.

19
00:02:57,487 --> 00:02:58,545
Be quiet.

20
00:02:58,588 --> 00:03:00,749
Let me and my son watch the movie.

21
00:03:06,262 --> 00:03:07,854
''Once upon a time in la la land.''

22
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,263
''Listen. Listen.
The praise of Tees Maar Khan.''

23
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:20,498
''TMK.''

24

''Tees Maar Khan.''

26
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:39,322
''Tees Maar Khan.''

27
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:43,661
''Tees Maar Khan.''

28
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:47,999
''Tees Maar Khan.''

00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:07,388
''Listen. Listen.
The jest of Tees Maar Khan.''

37
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,424
''Catch me if you can.
Catch me if you can.''

38
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,754
''Chase me and
l'll run faster than l can.''

39
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:13,988
''Catch me if you can.
Catch me if you can.''

40
00:04:14,263 --> 00:04:16,356
''Catch me and l'll slip
right through your hands.''

41
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:18,626
''Catch him if you can.
Catch him if you can.''

42
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:20,896
''Shoot him or kill him.
Whatever you can.''

43
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,302
''Catch him if you can.
Catch him if you can.''

44
00:04:23,372 --> 00:04:25,602
''Caught him and locked him,
but he's slipped again.''

45
00:04:25,675 --> 00:04:27,768
''Once upon a time in la la land.''

46
00:04:27,843 --> 00:04:30,038
''Listen. Listen.
The praise of Tees Maar Khan.''

47
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:32,338

''Listen. Listen.

51
00:04:39,455 --> 00:04:41,446
''Khan of Khans was a con man.''

52
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:44,424
''Listen. Listen.
The jest of Tees Maar Khan.''

53
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,428
''Tees Maar Khan.''

54
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,837
''Tees Maar Khan.''

55
00:04:55,905 --> 00:04:58,533
''Tees Maar Khan.''

56
00:04:58,574 --> 00:05:00,371
''Tees Maar Khan.''

57
00:05:00,977 --> 00:05:03,309
''Every time he walked with pride.''

58
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:05,472
''Every plan got foiled.''

59
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:07,778
''Every time he walked with pride.''

60
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,284
''Every plan got foiled.''

61
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:12,480
''Every time he worked his charm.''

62
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,648
''Every one prospered.''

63
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:16,817
''Every time he worked his charm.''

64
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:19,417
''Every one prospered.''

65
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:24,426
''Tees Maar Khan.''

66
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:28,767
''Tees Maar Khan.''

67
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:31,602
''Tees Maar Khan.''

68
00:05:31,674 --> 00:05:32,936
''Tees Maar Khan.''

69
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:36,035
''Tees Maar Khan.''

70
00:05:36,312 --> 00:05:37,711
''Tees Maar Khan.''

71
00:05:43,986 --> 00:05:45,044
What happened?

72
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:46,447
The tank's leaking.

73
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:47,580
Should l call the plumber?

74
00:05:47,657 --> 00:05:49,989
What plumber, you idiot?
l broke water.

75
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:51,720
Then let's go to the hospital.
- Let's go to the doctor.

76
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:55,522
Congratulations! lt's a boy.
- Thank God.

77
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,794
And my wife? - Both the baby
and the mother are all right.

78
00:05:57,867 --> 00:05:59,300
ln a while she will..

79
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:00,526
My watch?

80
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:05,897
My chain?

81
00:06:13,282 --> 00:06:15,216
''Tees Maar Khan.''

82
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:17,479
Well done, officers.

83
00:06:17,553 --> 00:06:21,956
Last night we've cracked the
largest antique smuggling racket..

84
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:23,514
..in the history of crime.

85
00:06:24,694 --> 00:06:26,958
Our country's thousands
of years old..

86
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:31,489
..priceless diamonds, pearls,
jewellery, paintings, statues.

87
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:35,898
ln all, we stopped
10,000kg of national treasure..

88
00:06:35,971 --> 00:06:38,599
..from being sold to
foreign countries.

89
00:06:38,908 --> 00:06:41,877
ln the international market,
the approximate value..

90
00:06:41,977 --> 00:06:44,002
..of these items is Rs.5 billion.

91
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:50,275
The lnterpol suspects
that this stuff belongs to..

92
00:06:50,352 --> 00:06:53,515
..the Johri Brothers.
The antique smugglers.

93
00:06:54,356 --> 00:06:57,325
These Siamese twins
aren't among those..

94
00:06:57,393 --> 00:06:59,384
..who'd let go of
their goods so easily.

95
00:06:59,995 --> 00:07:02,657
They will surely try
to get them back.

96
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:06,859
Hence, our job doesn't end here.

97
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:10,428
Our next mission is
to get these goods..

98
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:12,600
..to the government treasury
in Delhi.

99
00:07:12,842 --> 00:07:15,902
And the name of this mission
will be 'Bharat'.. - 'Bhushan.'

100
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:20,506
Shut up, Jagtap.

101
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:24,447
And the name of
this mission will be..

102
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,417
..'Bharat Ka Khazana'
(Treasure of lndia).

103
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,553
ln this mission, we will
transport this treasure..

104
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:34,027
..in a special high
security train to Delhi.

105
00:07:34,864 --> 00:07:37,992
Remember, this train
will go directly to Delhi.

106
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:39,665
There will be no halts in between.

107
00:07:39,902 --> 00:07:44,862
Now, the Johri Brothers have
only one way to get the antiques.

108
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:49,741
To steal it from a moving train.
- He's talking nonsense.

109
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:53,543
As we all know, the Johri
Brothers don't execute..

110
00:07:53,616 --> 00:07:56,380
..their illegal work themselves.

111
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:01,322
As always, they will
take someone else's help.

112
00:08:01,624 --> 00:08:05,560
But who is brave and smart enough..

113
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:08,623
..to steal the treasure
from right under our noses..

114
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:09,959
..and that too, in broad daylight?

115
00:08:10,332 --> 00:08:11,492
Broad daylight?

116
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:13,900
He can do it in the
darkness of the night as well.

117
00:08:14,236 --> 00:08:15,464
And why ''from under our noses''?

118
00:08:15,504 --> 00:08:17,529
He can do that behind
our backs as well. Right?

119
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:19,733
Jagtap, shut up!

120
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:24,706
As per our information, only
three people can do this job.

121
00:08:24,847 --> 00:08:26,007
First candidate.

122
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:30,343
From Hyderabad, lsmail Sheikh
alias lsmail 'Koyla' (coal).

123
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:35,386
ls lsmail darker than coal?
Or vice versa?

124
00:08:35,457 --> 00:08:37,254
That's hard to say.

125
00:08:37,526 --> 00:08:39,426
'lsmail possesses two weapons.'

126
00:08:39,495 --> 00:08:41,395
'One, the darkness of the night.'

127
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:44,761
'And second, lsmail's smile.'

128
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,030
'Koyla. Koyla.'

129
00:08:51,774 --> 00:08:53,537
'Koyla. Koyla.'

130
00:08:56,278 --> 00:08:57,370
'Koyla. Koyla.'

131
00:08:58,314 --> 00:09:00,339
lsmail Koyla, you're under arrest.

132
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:04,350
'ln the darkness of the night,
like a shadow in the dark..'

133
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,682
'..lsmail just disappears.'

134
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:07,446
He escaped again.

135
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,988
That's why we've not been able
to catch lsmail. Right, sir?

136
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:17,528
A few years ago, lsmail
tried to rob Salarjung Museum.

137
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,503
But this time,
unfortunately, l got his case.

138
00:09:22,738 --> 00:09:25,639
Sir, unfortunate for you or him?

139
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:29,343
Jagtap, shut up and listen.

140
00:09:33,515 --> 00:09:34,709
'Koyla. Koyla.'

141
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:38,281
lsmail 'Koyla', you're under arrest.

142
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:42,688
'But till then,
his tricks had become obsolete.'

143
00:09:42,758 --> 00:09:46,524
lsmail, why don't you
stop these robberies..

144
00:09:46,896 --> 00:09:49,296
..and lead an honest life?

145
00:09:49,431 --> 00:09:52,366
l have a
mind-blowing job offer for you.

146
00:09:52,701 --> 00:09:54,498
You'll get Rs.100,000 an hour.

147
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,935
'Koyla.'

148
00:09:56,338 --> 00:09:59,432
The headlights of
Rajdhani Express aren't working.

149
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:02,642
You have to run ahead of
it with your teeth exposed.

150
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:06,275
There he is. Catch him! Catch him!

151
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:10,614
l-smile, please.

152
00:10:12,021 --> 00:10:15,457
The second candidate
is Master lndia.

153
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,519
You mean Mr. lndia?

154
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:20,619
l mean Master lndia.
- Oh, sorry.

155
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:22,754
Mr. lndia was a decent guy.

156
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:25,767
Master lndia is his spoilt kid..

157
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:30,066
..who is taking undue advantage
of his great father's powers.

158
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:35,408
'Where lsmail Koyla steals quietly
in the darkness of the night..'

159
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:41,446
'..Master lndia steals in
broad daylight and in public.'

160
00:10:43,886 --> 00:10:46,377
Hey, thief. Thief.

161
00:10:48,624 --> 00:10:49,852
Someone stop him.

162
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:52,519
He stole the necklace
and disappeared.

163
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:58,999
Since that day, l attended
every party, function and wedding..

164
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:02,003
..in order to catch Master lndia.

165
00:11:02,404 --> 00:11:04,304
And then one day..

166
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:14,607
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

167
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:17,811
'On the pretext of shaking hands,
l exchanged his bracelet.'

168
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,285
lt's okay. lt's okay.

169
00:11:28,864 --> 00:11:32,459
Oh, God. He's stripping.

170
00:11:32,634 --> 00:11:35,432
'Master lndia thought
he's invisible.'

171
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:38,029
'And he started
dancing nude in celebration.'

172
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:42,603
'He didn't know that
everyone can see him.'

173
00:11:47,516 --> 00:11:48,778
Keep away.

174
00:11:52,454 --> 00:11:58,359
Master lndia, the
commissioner is happy.

175
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:04,521
And that leaves the third candidate
who is still roaming free.

176
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:11,572
From Mumbai, Tabrez Mirza
Khan alias Tees Maar Khan.

177
00:12:13,475 --> 00:12:16,876
His fans also call
him half Robin Hood.

178
00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:19,040
Why half Robin Hood, sir?

179
00:12:19,348 --> 00:12:21,009
Because he steals from the rich..

180
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,682
..but doesn't give it to the poor.

181
00:12:23,018 --> 00:12:26,977
lndia's sharpest criminal mastermind.
Tees Maar Khan.

182
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:28,421
Sir!

183
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:30,449
Hello.

184
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,525
Gentlemen, there's good news.

185
00:12:33,862 --> 00:12:35,887
Mr. lndia part two is
about to begin?! - You!

186
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,727
Sorry. Sorry, sir.

187
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:39,664
We've just received information..

188
00:12:39,735 --> 00:12:42,898
..that Tees Maar Khan was
arrested in Paris.. - Yes!

189
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,800
..while giving autographs
to his fans.

190
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,845
Unfortunately, one of those
fans was an lnterpol agent.

191
00:12:54,383 --> 00:12:55,816
Thank you. Thank you.

192
00:12:56,051 --> 00:13:01,990
Gentlemen, as we speak, Tees
Maar Khan is being brought to lndia.

193
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:13,596
''TMK.''

194
00:13:21,376 --> 00:13:22,741
''Tees Maar Khan.''

195
00:13:25,814 --> 00:13:27,509
''Tees Maar Khan.''

196
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,918
''Tees Maar Khan.''

197
00:13:31,987 --> 00:13:35,548
''Tees Maar Khan.''

198
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:38,049
''Tees Maar Khan.''

199
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:39,658
Finally, here they come.

200
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,556
CBl officer Chatterjee.
- Hello.

201
00:13:42,598 --> 00:13:44,361
CBl officer Mukherjee.
- He's your man.

202
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,925
We'll take it from here.
- Okay. - Yes.

203
00:13:58,981 --> 00:14:00,380
Have it, buddy. Have it.

204
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:02,507
Eat as much as you want today.

205
00:14:02,985 --> 00:14:04,782
Tomorrow, you'll
have to eat prison food.

206
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:05,979
Right, brother?

207
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:14,452
Saving the honour of a harlot
and imprisoning Tees Maar Khan.

208
00:14:15,497 --> 00:14:16,862
Both are futile.

209
00:14:19,334 --> 00:14:21,029
Tomorrow, l'll have lunch at home..

210
00:14:21,937 --> 00:14:26,874
..with my mother and not in prison.

211
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:42,584
Man, l don't get it.

212
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,483
Boss got arrested in Paris.

213
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,853
So why did he ask us
to be here with the car?

214
00:14:47,396 --> 00:14:48,795
Can't the Mumbai police
send their own vehicle?

215
00:14:48,864 --> 00:14:52,061
Burger, you idiot. Boss has
planned to trick the police.

216
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:53,596
That's why we're here with our car.

217
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:05,640
Boss' plane!
- Where? Where?

218
00:15:05,814 --> 00:15:07,516
Over there.
- Not here. Over there.

219
00:15:07,516 --> 00:15:10,542
Captain.
- Thank you.

220
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:11,677
Hey, look.

221
00:15:11,753 --> 00:15:13,345
Some big hero is
getting off over there.

222
00:15:13,422 --> 00:15:14,514
Where?
- Show me.

223
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,584
Bye.
- Bye.

224
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:23,026
ldiots, that is our boss. Look.

225
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,925
Boss? Just a minute.
- Boss!

226
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:26,799
''Tees Maar Khan.''

227
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:27,926
''Tees Maar Khan.''

228
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:30,471
Thank you.
- Police, boss.

229
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:32,370
Love you, police.

230
00:15:32,441 --> 00:15:34,375
''Tees Maar Khan.''
- Great!

231
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:38,435
Khan of Khans, Tees Maar Khan.

232
00:15:38,513 --> 00:15:39,810
Come on. Come on.

233
00:15:40,415 --> 00:15:43,782
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
- See you. - Thank you.

234
00:15:43,952 --> 00:15:45,419
Hey, boys.

235
00:15:46,421 --> 00:15:48,946
Boss!
- Boss.

236
00:15:49,024 --> 00:15:50,355
What is it?

237
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:52,325
Burger, Dollar, Soda.
How are you all?

238
00:15:52,394 --> 00:15:53,486
We're fine.

239
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:54,586
Boss, car..

240
00:15:57,566 --> 00:16:01,525
That's not our car. lt's this one.

241
00:16:05,641 --> 00:16:09,441
''Tees Maar Khan.''

242
00:16:09,478 --> 00:16:10,638
Let's cruise, boys.

243
00:16:10,712 --> 00:16:12,805
''Tees Maar Khan.''

244
00:16:12,881 --> 00:16:14,473
This is great, boss.

245
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:15,574
Boss. Boss.

246
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:17,482
Boss, tell us what this is all about.
- Tell us, boss.

247
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,851
Yes, boss. This golden suit,
Bappi Lahiri's chains and all.

248
00:16:19,921 --> 00:16:22,617
This rock solid car and
all those kisses back there.

249
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:26,525
Boss, tell us. How did you
trick the police? Boss. Boss..

250
00:16:26,595 --> 00:16:30,793
Saving the honour of a harlot
and imprisoning Tees Maar Khan.

251
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,766
Both are..
- Futile.

252
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:34,267
Both are..

253
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,834
Forget that. Tell us, boss.

254
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:40,905
A few days ago..
Hey, eyes on the road.

255
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:44,473
Keep your voice down, you idiot.
Do you know who l am?

256
00:16:44,513 --> 00:16:46,640
You're nobody. - But ma'am,
dogs are not allowed on the plane.

257
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:50,674
How dare you? How dare
you call Penny a dog?

258
00:16:50,752 --> 00:16:52,743
l will shut your darn airline.
- But rules are rules, ma'am.

259
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:53,879
Sorry, ma'am. Sorry.

260
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:55,889
Sorry, ma'am. Sorry.
She doesn't know who you are.

261
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:57,891
Please sit down. Please sit.
- But sir..

262
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,051
Please settle down, everyone.

263
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:00,418
You come with me.

264
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:03,556
But sir.. - Are you crazy?
Pankaj Shukla is her father.

265
00:17:03,632 --> 00:17:04,826
The Aviation Minister.
- l'm sorry.

266
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,427
Go say sorry to her. Go on.
- Okay, sir.

267
00:17:06,702 --> 00:17:07,794
Go on.

268
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:23,812
Later on.
- Okay.

269
00:17:25,487 --> 00:17:27,011
l'll do it right here.
- Okay.

270
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:29,917
Okay. Okay.
l know you're Tees Maar Khan.

271
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:32,260
But this is a toilet on a plane.

272
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:33,553
Not a toilet in High Court..

273
00:17:33,628 --> 00:17:34,959
..from where you can
jump out and escape.

274
00:17:35,364 --> 00:17:36,763
Just like the last time. Okay?

275
00:17:36,832 --> 00:17:37,992
Right, brother?

276
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,668
lf you're done with your
lousy jokes, then can l?

277
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:45,530
Come on. Come on.

278
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,474
Don't push. Otherwise, l might
end up doing it right here. - Okay.

279
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:09,456
They tied me up. Can
you remove my kerchief?

280
00:18:09,498 --> 00:18:12,296
He's so thick-skinned. Started
flirting here as well, brother.

281
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:13,527
Not so low. Not so low.

282
00:18:19,574 --> 00:18:20,768
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

283
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,878
Come on.
- Where? Out of the plane?

284
00:18:25,947 --> 00:18:27,608
Yes, out of the plane. Sit quietly.

285
00:18:46,568 --> 00:18:47,728
''Tees Maar Khan.''

286
00:18:47,803 --> 00:18:49,031
Oh, God!

287
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:54,767
What?

288
00:18:56,478 --> 00:18:57,502
You witch!

289
00:18:57,646 --> 00:19:00,809
You did this on purpose.
To take revenge on Penny.

290
00:19:01,216 --> 00:19:02,274
This dog came in between.

291
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,443
Shall l clean the dog?
Shall l? l will do it.

292
00:19:04,486 --> 00:19:05,578
You called him a dog again?

293
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,312
l knew it. You're jealous of Penny.

294
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:08,447
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

295
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,481
We're really sorry,
ma'am. Please let it go.

296
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,323
l won't let you go so easily.
l'll cancel your license.

297
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:14,725
Stop the plane. Land right now!

298
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:16,492
How can we land now, ma'am?

299
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:18,362
Why? Aren't there any
brakes in the plane?

300
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:19,900
Just apply the brakes and land.

301
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:22,664
Oh, God! Captain Bhalla,
please talk to her.

302
00:19:22,904 --> 00:19:24,872
Hey you! Where are you going?

303
00:19:25,607 --> 00:19:26,733
To apply the brakes.

304
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:29,834
Ma'am, try to understand.
- How can he talk to me like this?

305
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:33,005
Just see. What has happened
to my Penny? - Captain Andrew!

306
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:34,475
Captain Andrew!

307
00:19:35,517 --> 00:19:36,575
Hello.

308
00:19:36,651 --> 00:19:38,551
What are you doing here?
- l was in the toilet.

309
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,746
Then who is flying the plane?

310
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:41,482
l put the plane on auto-pilot.

311
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:45,020
Big problem.

312
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:47,386
One. Two. Three. All
three captains are outside.

313
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:48,486
So who's flying the plane?

314
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:51,691
This idiot Captain Andrew has
put the plane on auto-pilot.

315
00:19:51,766 --> 00:19:53,631
Now all the three captains
are outside the cockpit..

316
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:54,827
..and the door isn't
opening either.

317
00:19:54,936 --> 00:19:56,267
We're dead. We're finished.

318
00:19:56,371 --> 00:19:57,770
l'm telling you we're finished.

319
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:04,478
This is just mafia.
l am going to sue you.

320
00:20:04,513 --> 00:20:06,037
l am going to sue you.

321
00:20:06,314 --> 00:20:07,542
Silence. Silence. Don't fight.

322
00:20:07,616 --> 00:20:08,844
Let's try to open the door.

323
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,885
Yes. Yes. Let's go.
- Come on.

324
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,712
Please. Please.

325
00:20:12,787 --> 00:20:14,414
Please. Move.

326
00:20:17,058 --> 00:20:18,525
ldiot, aren't you ashamed
of yourself?

327
00:20:18,693 --> 00:20:21,025
Everyone is trying to open the
door and you're sitting here?

328
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,761
Oh, my God! Shackles?

329
00:20:23,832 --> 00:20:25,493
Not shackles, Aunt. Handcuffs.

330
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:26,626
Why don't you release him?

331
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:27,929
What do you mean release him?

332
00:20:28,003 --> 00:20:30,335
lf we remove his handcuffs,
then there'd be a big problem.

333
00:20:30,405 --> 00:20:31,497
Please go mind your own business.

334
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,598
Poor guy.

335
00:20:32,674 --> 00:20:34,471
He's no poor guy.

336
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:35,874
You don't know him.

337
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:39,813
There's no lock or safe
that he can't break open.

338
00:20:39,881 --> 00:20:41,610
He can open every lock in the world.

339
00:20:41,683 --> 00:20:45,016
Oh, my God!
- Brother, you put us in a fix.

340
00:20:51,993 --> 00:20:53,585
Open it.
- What?

341
00:20:53,662 --> 00:20:55,823
The lock. The door lock.

342
00:20:56,698 --> 00:20:58,563
Brother, please open it.

343
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:00,392
Please.

344
00:21:00,602 --> 00:21:01,694
No.

345
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,670
Why is that, son?
Don't you want to live?

346
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:10,502
Upon survival, you guys will go
back to your luxurious villas.

347
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:13,878
To your wives, or girlfriends,
or boyfriends..

348
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:16,611
..or even your mistresses.

349
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:21,784
But l'll.. l'll go to prison for
nine years. Rigorous imprisonment.

350
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,656
What kind of life is that, son?

351
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:28,560
So uncle, what do you want?

352
00:21:29,464 --> 00:21:32,763
Freedom! From these two.

353
00:21:32,968 --> 00:21:34,333
Brother.
- Brother.

354
00:21:34,903 --> 00:21:36,803

All of you will go to jail.

359
00:21:44,646 --> 00:21:46,705
lt's better to go to
jail than to go up. Come on.

''Ain't nobody got a body like..

497
00:28:59,847 --> 00:29:00,871
You..

498
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,245
Who is it?

499
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,284
No.

500
00:29:07,522 --> 00:29:09,387
No. Leave me.

501
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:12,153
Please.

502
00:29:12,693 --> 00:29:13,751
Anya?
- l hate you.

503
00:29:13,828 --> 00:29:14,920
Anya?
- l hate you!

504
00:29:14,996 --> 00:29:16,258
Anya, listen to me.

505
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,264
That producer was going
to sign with me today.

506
00:29:18,332 --> 00:29:20,800
He would have signed you,
but where was the contract?

507
00:29:21,002 --> 00:29:22,902
ln the hotel room of
that drunkard producer?

508
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,803
For your information, the
contract was in his pocket.

509
00:29:25,873 --> 00:29:27,670
The pen was in his hotel room.

510
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:32,673
Anya, acting is just nonsense.

511
00:29:33,448 --> 00:29:37,714
Acting is like..
is like chewing gum.

512
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:40,953
lt feels good to
chew in the beginning.

513
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:43,718
Later on, it gets
difficult to spit it out.

514
00:29:44,258 --> 00:29:45,987
You've been chewing
it for a long time.

515
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,524
That's why you get
emotionally attached.

516
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,488
Forget about acting, darling.

517
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:56,326
At least l'm trying to lead an
honest and respectable life.

518
00:29:56,637 --> 00:29:59,663
Being an item girl is a million
times better than being a thief.

519
00:30:01,442 --> 00:30:03,501
Zip. l'm not a thief.

520
00:30:03,578 --> 00:30:08,481
l'm a con-artist. A crime artist.

521
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:11,481
Secondly, mother will hear.
Lower your voice.

522
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,679
Let her hear!

523
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:17,685
Let mother also know that her son,
who is the apple of her eye..

524
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:20,590
..who she thinks is
a big film director..

525
00:30:20,628 --> 00:30:24,621
..is none other than the
wanted criminal Tees Maar Khan.

526
00:30:27,401 --> 00:30:31,701
No! Wanted criminal Tees Maar Khan?

527
00:30:31,772 --> 00:30:33,569
Where? Where is he?

528
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:38,775
Did you see that? Tees Maar Khan
is not a criminal, Mother.

529
00:30:38,846 --> 00:30:41,644
lt's the name of my next film.

530
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:42,808
Oh, God!
- Silly.

531
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:43,942
What do you think?

532
00:30:44,018 --> 00:30:47,886
Very good. Better than
your last film.

533
00:30:47,955 --> 00:30:49,081
Which film?

534
00:30:49,357 --> 00:30:51,325
Well, 'Om Shanti Om'.

535
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,923
Sharp memory. You've
been feasting on almonds.

536
00:30:55,997 --> 00:30:57,726
Well, that's enough.
Sit down. Sit here.

537
00:30:57,798 --> 00:30:59,493
Anya, come here, dear.

538
00:30:59,534 --> 00:31:00,626
Come. Come.

539
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:03,537
You've come after a long time.

540
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:06,937
So l've prepared 'shikh kebab'
(lndian dish) for both of you.

541
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,635
Both of you have it, okay?
- Okay.

542
00:31:08,709 --> 00:31:11,007
Till then l'll prepare 'biryani'.
- Okay, Mother.

543
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:15,977
Why do you shout so much?

544
00:31:16,684 --> 00:31:18,276
You and your tonsils.

545
00:31:18,352 --> 00:31:19,876
What if mother would have found out?

546
00:31:20,454 --> 00:31:22,319
So what if she had found out?

547
00:31:22,557 --> 00:31:24,548
lt would've broken mother's heart.

548
00:31:24,892 --> 00:31:26,450
And your bones as well.

549
00:31:26,961 --> 00:31:30,920
lt's so shameful that
your mother doesn't know..

550
00:31:30,998 --> 00:31:32,522
..that you aren't a film director..

551
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,591
..but the wanted
criminal Tees Maar Khan.

552
00:31:35,536 --> 00:31:37,731
That's nothing new, you idiot.

553
00:31:38,072 --> 00:31:41,303
Even Spiderman's mother
doesn't know that he's Spiderman.

554
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,467
So what?

555
00:31:42,677 --> 00:31:47,910
At least l can say that l'm
the beauty queen Anya Khan.

556
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:51,351
Do you have the guts to tell
the world who you really are?

557
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:53,819
That you're Tees Maar Khan?
Chicken.

558
00:31:54,355 --> 00:31:56,084
Me?
- Yes, you are.

559
00:31:56,457 --> 00:31:58,948
l'll show you whether l'm a
chicken or a brave man. Wait.

560
00:31:59,894 --> 00:32:03,921
Yes! l am Tees Maar Khan!
l am Tees Maar Khan!

561
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:09,835
Boss, the police!

562
00:32:10,404 --> 00:32:11,871
l'm not Tees Maar Khan.

563
00:32:11,939 --> 00:32:14,999
l swear by Allah, l'm not.
l'm not. l swear.

564
00:32:18,379 --> 00:32:20,540
The police are outside. Handle them.
- Police?

565
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,278
And mother too.

566
00:32:24,385 --> 00:32:25,977
But Tabrez, how can l?

567
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,851
You desire to be an actress,
don't you? - Yes.

568
00:32:27,955 --> 00:32:29,354
Go do your acting. Go on.

569
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,464
Who is it? Has anyone died?

570
00:32:38,532 --> 00:32:39,760
Who is ringing the bell repeatedly?

571
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:42,803
Mummy, two actors were supposed
to come for the screen test.

572
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,028
Actors?

573
00:32:44,405 --> 00:32:45,770
For 'Tees Maar Khan'.

574
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,068
They were called for
the role of cops.

575
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,673
Oh, yes. But where is Tabrez?

576
00:32:49,744 --> 00:32:50,836
Where is he?

577
00:32:50,911 --> 00:32:52,378
He's hiding.

578
00:32:52,647 --> 00:32:54,080
He's hiding? But why?

579
00:32:54,815 --> 00:32:56,680
They have to act as if
they're searching for him.

580
00:32:56,751 --> 00:32:57,843
That's the test.

581
00:32:59,553 --> 00:33:02,716
So let's do one thing.
l'll take their test.

582
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,415
After all,
l'm the director's mother.

583
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:07,586
Do one thing. Go sit over there.

584
00:33:08,262 --> 00:33:09,354
Okay.

585
00:33:11,932 --> 00:33:13,559
Police.
- ls Tees Maar Khan here?

586
00:33:13,634 --> 00:33:14,999
You idiots!

587
00:33:15,503 --> 00:33:17,733
Are you cops or people
who ask for donations?

588
00:33:17,805 --> 00:33:21,764
You'll ask me where Tees
Maar Khan is and l'll tell you?

589
00:33:21,842 --> 00:33:23,776
Come on. Ask me again. Again.

590
00:33:23,844 --> 00:33:26,369
And this time ask me a bit strictly.
Okay? - Yes. Yes.

591
00:33:26,514 --> 00:33:27,776
Come on.

592
00:33:34,488 --> 00:33:36,513
Police!
- ls Tees Maar Khan here?

593
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:37,785
That's more like it.

594
00:33:37,992 --> 00:33:40,859
Now you push me and enter.

595
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:43,420
Come on, push me. Get in the house.

596
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:47,629
l pushed you.

597
00:33:47,802 --> 00:33:50,032
You too. Push me. Come on.

598
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:52,964
Where do these people come from?

599
00:33:53,774 --> 00:33:55,071
Brother, he said he
must be here somewhere.

600
00:33:55,343 --> 00:33:56,605
Mummy!
- What happened?

601
00:33:56,677 --> 00:33:57,769
l'll search for proof here.
You look there.

602
00:33:57,845 --> 00:33:58,971
Oh, Allah!

603
00:33:59,313 --> 00:34:02,612
You idiot, you did get
into the character..

604
00:34:02,683 --> 00:34:05,652
..but who will clean up
the mess you've created?

605
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,278
Your father?

606
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:09,755
Come on. Put it inside.
Put everything back.

607
00:34:09,824 --> 00:34:11,485
No. No. Why will he do that?
Tell me.

608
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:13,789
Not just him. You too will
put everything back. Okay?

609
00:34:13,861 --> 00:34:14,987
l'll also do it.

610
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,696
Will you put it back
or should l slap you?

611
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:19,858
Run. Run.
- The old lady has gone mad.

612
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:21,333
Run.

613
00:34:21,402 --> 00:34:22,494

The Khan of Khans..

616
00:34:33,748 --> 00:34:34,942
Boss..
- You scoundrel.

617
00:34:35,015 --> 00:34:36,312
That reminds me.

618
00:34:36,384 --> 00:34:37,510
There was a call for you
from the Johri Brothers.

619
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:39,519
Johri Brothers? The
international antique smugglers?

620
00:34:39,587 --> 00:34:40,713
What do they have to do with boss?

621

625
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,426
Rascal, you stole my mother's phone.

Putting it on speakerphone.

00:35:22,463 --> 00:35:24,055
''And l have your company.''

637
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:27,623
''Today l have your hand in my hand.''

''Today l have your hand in my hand.''

641
00:35:41,882 --> 00:35:43,042
There are the Siamese twins.

642
00:35:43,317 --> 00:35:44,511
Boss, your stick.

643
00:35:44,585 --> 00:35:45,643
Thank you.

00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:47,050
'Dandiya!'

645
00:35:47,388 --> 00:35:48,650
Come, Tees Maar Khan.

646
00:35:48,722 --> 00:35:51,486
You probably know why
we've called you here.

647
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:53,592
You've called me to play 'Dandiya'..

648
00:35:53,627 --> 00:35:54,889
..on the occasion of
'Dusshera' (lndian festival).

649
00:35:54,995 --> 00:35:56,485
Bad joke. Should we laugh?

650
00:35:56,564 --> 00:35:59,795
lf you guys want to get
your Rs.5 billion antiques..

651
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:03,826
..from the police, then you'll
have to laugh at my lousy joke.

652
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:08,633
Then you might also know that
only one man can do this job.

653
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:09,801
l know.

654
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:13,711
And that is the Khan of Khans..
- Tees Maar Khan!

655
00:36:13,781 --> 00:36:15,442
That means you'll do this job.

656
00:36:15,483 --> 00:36:16,950
Are you asking me or telling me?

657
00:36:17,017 --> 00:36:18,382
We're asking you.

658
00:36:18,452 --> 00:36:20,283
All right. Then l'll do it.

659
00:36:22,423 --> 00:36:25,620
Now the deal. 50 percent of
the value of the goods is for me.

660
00:36:27,261 --> 00:36:29,525
That was not a joke, you rascals.

661
00:36:29,597 --> 00:36:30,655
Blackmail?

662
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:33,359
Those goods belong to us.
You just have to get it out.

Goods weighing 10,000kg.

00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:37,927
l have to get it out
of a moving train.

665
00:36:37,972 --> 00:36:39,337
Moreover, it's in the
possession of the police.

666
00:36:39,373 --> 00:36:40,465
Do you think it's child's play?

667
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:45,509
But if l don't do your job,
then you'll lose your treasure.

668

Ladies and gentlemen.

669

00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,450
There's still time.
Tell me quickly. 50 percent.

700
00:37:57,551 --> 00:37:58,575
The cops are coming.

701
00:37:58,619 --> 00:37:59,745
Done!
- Done!

702
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,787
Open the ATM.

703
00:38:00,888 --> 00:38:02,753
Deduct it from my share.

704
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:05,656
Take it! Take it!

705
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:08,454
Got away, boss.
- Yes!

706
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,890
Stop. Let's go.

707
00:38:11,966 --> 00:38:14,526
Sir, sir, you do the honors.
- Sir.

708
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:17,533
Come here. Come here.

709
00:38:25,746 --> 00:38:29,648
l don't know how l'm
going to do this job.

710
00:38:30,818 --> 00:38:34,379
This is the toughest
assignment yet.

711
00:38:34,455 --> 00:38:35,547
What's so difficult, boss?

712
00:38:35,623 --> 00:38:37,454
Add these spices to the chicken.

713
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:38,855
..then add the chicken to the curd..

714
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:41,757
Don't you know that
boss' mind works overtime..

715
00:38:41,795 --> 00:38:43,524
..while preparing food?

716
00:38:43,564 --> 00:38:44,656
Sorry, boss.

717
00:38:45,499 --> 00:38:48,900
Getting 10,000kg of
antiques from a moving train..

718
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:52,405
..and that train might
have around 20 to 30 cops.

719
00:38:52,473 --> 00:38:54,634
Boss, we might trick the cops.

720
00:38:54,808 --> 00:38:57,868
But how are we going to
carry stuff weighing 10,000kg?

721
00:38:57,945 --> 00:38:59,276
lt will take at least a month.

722
00:38:59,613 --> 00:39:00,910
Moreover, we'll have to go to
the hospital a couple of times..

723
00:39:00,981 --> 00:39:02,414
..to get our broken backs treated.

724
00:39:02,616 --> 00:39:04,447
Boss, we'll need more men.

725
00:39:04,485 --> 00:39:07,215
We'll need 200 to 300 men.

726
00:39:07,287 --> 00:39:08,777
But where do we bring
so many men from, boss?

727
00:39:08,856 --> 00:39:10,790
We might gather all those men.

728
00:39:10,858 --> 00:39:12,587
But boss, to tell 300
people about our plan

729
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,821
..is fraught with danger.
- Correct.

730
00:39:15,496 --> 00:39:17,828
Even if one of those guys
turns out to be a police informer..

731
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:19,331
..then we're finished.

732
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,594
Boss!
- What happened?

733
00:39:20,634 --> 00:39:23,569
l think this job is.. impossible.

734
00:39:24,938 --> 00:39:27,771
There's no such word as
'impossible' in my dictionary.

735
00:39:27,841 --> 00:39:29,331
Don't you know that? Get lost!
Get out of here.

736
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,241
Boss, it's in my dictionary.
Want it?

737
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:32,471
Yes, get it. Get your dictionary.

738
00:39:32,513 --> 00:39:33,707
Boss!
- What happened?

739
00:39:33,781 --> 00:39:34,839
Boss, come out.

740
00:39:35,482 --> 00:39:38,383
Why are you shouting?
Why are you shouting?

741
00:39:38,452 --> 00:39:40,545
You're shouting, boss.
Look, that same hero.

742
00:39:40,621 --> 00:39:42,350
'ls there any award you
haven't won in lndia?'

743
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:44,323
'Which award are you
eyeing this time?'

744
00:39:45,025 --> 00:39:47,323
'Oscar!
- Oscar?'

745
00:39:47,394 --> 00:39:48,520
'Yes.'

746
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:50,961
'Dumbdog Millionaire
was offered to me first.'

747
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:54,998
'But due to my secretary
Bunty's foolishness..'

748
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:56,759
'..that role slipped
out of my hands.'

749
00:39:56,837 --> 00:39:57,895
'Sir, it hurts.'

750
00:39:58,038 --> 00:40:02,031
'But let me assure you
that Aatish Kapoor..'

751
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:04,767
'..will win the Oscar next
year and bring it back to lndia.'

752
00:40:05,412 --> 00:40:07,812
'l want to do an Oscar
winning film.'

753
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:10,546
'l want an Oscar.'

754
00:40:12,019 --> 00:40:14,920
Oscar, that's enough.

755
00:40:14,988 --> 00:40:18,924
'l want an Oscar! l want an Oscar!
- Sir, last question.'

756
00:40:18,992 --> 00:40:21,324
'l want an Oscar!'

757
00:40:21,395 --> 00:40:23,955
Boss, that security
guy pushed me last night.

758
00:40:24,031 --> 00:40:25,999
Even after getting beaten up,
people are crazy about him.

759
00:40:26,066 --> 00:40:27,624
People worship him.

760
00:40:27,701 --> 00:40:29,498
And the cops provide
him security needlessly.

761
00:40:29,536 --> 00:40:31,731
And boss..
- Hold it. Hold it. Say that again.

762
00:40:31,872 --> 00:40:34,841
Boss, that security guy..
- Not you. You.

763
00:40:34,908 --> 00:40:37,536
People worship him.
- Cops provide security.

764
00:40:37,611 --> 00:40:41,604
People worship him.
Cops provide security.

765
00:40:42,516 --> 00:40:47,613
People worship him and
cops provide security.

766
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:49,379
l got it!

767
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:53,019
Got it? What?

768
00:40:53,894 --> 00:40:56,522
A plan to get your goods out.

769
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:57,857
Very good!

770
00:40:57,931 --> 00:40:59,796
That's what we expected from you.

771
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:00,891
What's the plan?

772
00:41:00,968 --> 00:41:03,402
What do you care?
Your job will be done.

773
00:41:03,537 --> 00:41:06,768
Job will be done.
But whose job? Ours or yours?

774
00:41:06,907 --> 00:41:09,432
Do you doubt my honesty?
Don't you trust me?

775
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,377
You tell us.
Can we really trust you?

776
00:41:12,446 --> 00:41:14,937
To expect sunlight from the moon..

777
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:17,540
..and honesty from Tees Maar Khan.

778
00:41:17,618 --> 00:41:19,609
Both are futile.

779
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:22,280
We know that you're dishonest,
but you're not a cheat.

780
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:23,854
Come on, tell us the plan.

781
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:25,423
Listen carefully.

782
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,393
l'll shoot for a film in
a village that is close to..

783
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:31,920
..the railway tracks on which
the train to Delhi will be running.

784
00:41:32,432 --> 00:41:37,734
That too, with lndia's
famous superstar Aatish Kapoor.

785
00:41:39,506 --> 00:41:40,530
Good joke.

786
00:41:40,607 --> 00:41:43,303
That's not a joke. lt's my plan.

787
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:44,537
Let's drink.

788
00:41:44,678 --> 00:41:47,545
ln a burqa?
- Let's have tea in a burqa.

789
00:41:47,581 --> 00:41:49,776
The train that is
carrying your goods..

790
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:53,308
..will be a part of this story.

791
00:41:56,056 --> 00:42:00,993
Aatish Kapoor and
300 innocent villagers.

792
00:42:01,461 --> 00:42:04,521
They will play the
part of revolutionaries.

793
00:42:06,533 --> 00:42:09,991
Mistaking our train to
be a British train..

794
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:13,797
..they will stop that
train no matter what it takes.

795
00:42:14,474 --> 00:42:19,275
Then the villagers will get on
that train and capture the cops..

796
00:42:19,346 --> 00:42:21,541
..they will thrash
them pretty badly..

797
00:42:21,715 --> 00:42:24,946
..and then they will
unload the goods..

798
00:42:25,018 --> 00:42:27,486
..and load it in your vehicles.

799
00:42:27,721 --> 00:42:31,953
Just because there's a famous
star Aatish Kapoor in the film..

800
00:42:32,025 --> 00:42:36,325
..nobody will even think that
something illegal is going on.

801
00:42:36,697 --> 00:42:39,029
ln fact, all this will be done..

802
00:42:39,399 --> 00:42:40,866
..under the watchful
eye of the police.

803
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:45,928
That is, full police protection.

804
00:42:47,975 --> 00:42:50,000
Great! Great, you're..

805
00:42:50,844 --> 00:42:52,402
Say it, guys.

806
00:42:52,613 --> 00:42:54,774
The Khan of Khans, Tees Maar Khan.

807
00:42:54,848 --> 00:42:57,078
Who is the director?
- Who? - Who?

808
00:42:57,351 --> 00:42:58,648
l'm the director.

809
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:00,653
That's great.
So we're the producers.

810
00:43:00,821 --> 00:43:02,015
We'll keep an eye on the director.

811
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:04,382
But l..
- Khan, no need to thank us.

812
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:05,482
See you on the sets.

813
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:06,617
Boss, control.

814
00:43:06,693 --> 00:43:07,819
They're the ones
who'll be paying us.

815
00:43:07,895 --> 00:43:09,362
Lousy baldies.

816
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:10,794
Boss, the plan is on paper.
What next?

817
00:43:11,732 --> 00:43:13,791
Now let's celebrate Eid.

818
00:43:13,934 --> 00:43:15,731
But boss, Eid was three months ago.

819
00:43:15,903 --> 00:43:17,427
For Tees Maar Khan, the
sighting of the moon..

820
00:43:17,504 --> 00:43:18,528
..on any night is like Eid.

821
00:43:18,605 --> 00:43:20,903
So boss, call up Brother Salman.

822
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:22,032
You rascal.

823
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:23,401
Call him.

824
00:43:23,477 --> 00:43:24,739
Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

825
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:26,571
Hurry up!

826
00:43:27,514 --> 00:43:30,847
Hello, Sallu. Yes, this is
Tees Maar Khan speaking.

827
00:43:30,951 --> 00:43:32,418
What's up?

828
00:43:32,786 --> 00:43:35,346
The guys have offered prayers.
Let's celebrate Eid.

829
00:43:36,556 --> 00:43:37,818
ln front of Anya's house.

830
00:43:37,891 --> 00:43:39,586
Yes. You know her?

831
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,685
He knows Anya.

832
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:43,986
Okay. Okay.
- Wonderful! Wonderful!

833
00:43:44,097 --> 00:43:45,155
Let's go.

834
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:49,526
''Behind the cold curtain..''

835
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:53,829
''..the flame blazes safely.''

836
00:43:54,708 --> 00:43:59,372
''Only when the admirer burns..''

837
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:02,912
''Burns down to ashes..''

838
00:44:03,383 --> 00:44:08,320
''..is he called a lover.''

839
00:44:12,626 --> 00:44:14,526
''By God.''

840
00:44:14,561 --> 00:44:16,586
''By God.''

841
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:18,898
''Beheld a timeless beauty.''

842
00:44:18,966 --> 00:44:20,934
''By God.''

843
00:44:21,001 --> 00:44:22,491
''By God.''

844
00:44:22,536 --> 00:44:25,266
''My beloved became rarest of rare.''

845
00:44:25,339 --> 00:44:27,364
''By God.''

846
00:44:27,441 --> 00:44:29,500
''By God.''

847
00:44:29,743 --> 00:44:32,644
''l'll gift away the moon on Eid.''

848
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:35,677
''ln the name of love,
l accept disgrace.''

849
00:44:35,849 --> 00:44:38,317
''When there was
nothing left to sell..''

850
00:44:38,385 --> 00:44:40,876
''..l let go of my
life just like that.''

851
00:44:40,954 --> 00:44:42,421
''Let go of my life.
Let go of my life.''

852
00:44:42,489 --> 00:44:43,956
''By God.''

853
00:44:44,024 --> 00:44:45,992
''By God.''

854
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:49,790
''Towards my beloved,
this admirer has a duty.''

855
00:44:50,597 --> 00:44:54,465
''l offer my greetings.''

856
00:44:54,568 --> 00:44:58,561
''l offer my greetings.''

857
00:44:58,638 --> 00:45:02,938
''l offer my greetings.''

858
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:06,810
''l offer my greetings.''

859
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,939
''By God.''

860
00:45:09,016 --> 00:45:10,950
''By God.''

861
00:45:11,018 --> 00:45:13,248
''Beheld a timeless beauty.''

862
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,413
''By God.''

863
00:45:15,489 --> 00:45:17,457
''By God.''

864
00:45:21,461 --> 00:45:23,429
Boss, cine-star
Salman of 'Dabang' fame.

865
00:45:37,744 --> 00:45:40,577
''Without my beloved,
l lost my entire glow.''

866
00:45:40,747 --> 00:45:43,648
''Upset with myself and
distanced from God.''

867
00:45:44,317 --> 00:45:50,779
''When her name was
mentioned in the gathering.''

868
00:45:51,425 --> 00:45:57,489
''Along with my beloved,
even l became famous.''

869
00:45:57,531 --> 00:46:00,500
''My beloved is in a happy mood.''

870
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:03,627
''My heart is cheerful,
the moment is rosy.''

871
00:46:03,703 --> 00:46:06,638
''My beloved is in a happy mood.''

872
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,570
''My heart is cheerful,
the moment is rosy.''

873

Yes, sir. These are your steps.

Okay?

''Choli mein holi. Holi mein choli.''

946
00:49:29,609 --> 00:49:31,474

Sir, the camera van also got stolen.

Yes, boss. This is the village that
passes through the railway track.

964
00:50:18,525 --> 00:50:19,583

a village called Narayanpur.

968
00:50:24,464 --> 00:50:26,557
l'll slap all of you.

969
00:50:26,766 --> 00:50:28,757
l wonder what kind of
idiots l've got as henchmen.

970
00:50:28,835 --> 00:50:31,303
No, boss. He told me.
- Soda told me. - No. No.

971
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:33,304
Why are you putting me in trouble?

972
00:50:33,373 --> 00:50:34,670
You told me.

973
00:50:36,376 --> 00:50:38,367
Who did you knock down?
- l don't know, boss.

974
00:50:40,046 --> 00:50:43,072
Who did you knock down?
- Where did he go?

975
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:44,749

Save me, brother.

981
00:50:54,527 --> 00:50:56,017
Boss, villagers.

982
00:50:59,532 --> 00:51:01,500
Looks like we've had it today, boss.

983
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:03,697
Don't worry.

984
00:51:03,837 --> 00:51:07,273
l'll pass on the blame..
to you guys. - Boss..

985
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,668
You're too much.

Let's go ahead.

987
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:17,412

We apologise to you on his behalf.

989
00:51:29,562 --> 00:51:31,587
He messes up all the time.

990
00:51:31,765 --> 00:51:33,357
But never intentionally.

991
00:51:33,933 --> 00:51:35,594
Eeshwar is immature.

992
00:51:36,503 --> 00:51:40,496
He's imbalanced?
- Yes, mentally. - Yes.

993
00:51:41,608 --> 00:51:44,543
By the way, the name of
this small village is Dhuliya.

994
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:46,711
And l'm the village chief.

00:52:26,419 --> 00:52:27,477
Did you see that, Nana?

1011
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,286
People in big cities like Mumbai
are talking about our village.

1012
00:52:31,391 --> 00:52:34,383
Didn't l tell you our village
will be very famous one day?

1013
00:52:34,427 --> 00:52:35,485
Subhedar.
- Yes?

1014
00:52:35,562 --> 00:52:36,859
Nana is over here, not there.

1015
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:39,688

Boss, camera.

1019
00:52:46,606 --> 00:52:47,698
That's more like it.

This isn't a small film. lt's a

00:53:52,372 --> 00:53:53,430
To watch the film shooting.

00:53:53,506 --> 00:53:54,564
l'm also coming.

1052
00:53:54,641 --> 00:53:56,973
There's a film shooting
going on. Come on. Film shooting!

1053
00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:00,641
Shooting! Shooting! Yes!

1054
00:54:02,815 --> 00:54:04,578
Listen.
- Stop.

1055
00:54:04,651 --> 00:54:06,482
Where are you going?

1056
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:08,612
Wait. l'm also coming
to watch the film shoot.

1057
00:54:16,029 --> 00:54:17,826
Move side. Move side.

1058
00:54:18,031 --> 00:54:20,022
Alright. Alright.

1059
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,268
You too can watch it..

1060
00:54:22,335 --> 00:54:24,803
Move aside. Have you gone mad?

1061
00:54:25,738 --> 00:54:27,672
Hand is up!

1062
00:54:30,843 --> 00:54:32,834
lnspector Dhurinder.

1063
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,405
l'm in charge of the
police station here.

1064
00:54:36,883 --> 00:54:41,582
Can l see your..
What do you call it? Permit.

1065
00:54:41,788 --> 00:54:43,278
Can l see your permit to shoot here?

1066
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,691
Amazing.

1067
00:54:52,765 --> 00:54:54,323
Heard his voice?
- Yes.

1068
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,958
Did you hear the inspector's voice?

1069
00:54:56,436 --> 00:55:00,497
Boss, l say let's
give him that main role.

1070
00:55:00,573 --> 00:55:03,303
Boss, let's give him the role of
the milkman. He looks like one.

1071
00:55:03,376 --> 00:55:04,741
No. No. Not the milkman's.

1072
00:55:04,811 --> 00:55:05,869
Let's change the role of the
milkman to that of an inspector.

1073
00:55:05,945 --> 00:55:07,242
Yes. Yes.

1074
00:55:07,313 --> 00:55:09,440
ls that.. is that possible?
- Of course. lt's possible.

1075
00:55:09,716 --> 00:55:12,651
But why would you change the
story of your film for me?

1076
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:13,913
What's the need?

1077
00:55:13,987 --> 00:55:15,579
Who am l?
- The director.

1078
00:55:15,655 --> 00:55:17,452
So l can surely do that.

1079
00:55:17,724 --> 00:55:19,385
But will l be able to do it, sir?

1080
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,757
Look, Dharmesh.
- Dharmesh?

1081
00:55:22,996 --> 00:55:26,955
ln this show business, either
you have it in you, or you don't.

1082
00:55:27,934 --> 00:55:29,629
And Dharmesh..
can l call you Dharmesh?

1083
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:31,533
But Dhurinder is..
- All right, Dharmendra.

1084
00:55:32,038 --> 00:55:33,562
You have it in you.

1085
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,800
What? What?

1086
00:55:34,874 --> 00:55:35,966
Oomph factor.

1087
00:55:36,042 --> 00:55:38,670
lt's a children's film. X-Factor.
- X-Factor.

1088
00:55:38,745 --> 00:55:43,978
You have that X-Factor.
And l want it. l want it.

1089
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:47,417
X-Factor?
- No. l want the shooting permit.

1090
00:55:47,487 --> 00:55:48,681
Don't worry.

1091
00:55:48,755 --> 00:55:50,518
Just prepare for the film shoot.

1092
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:52,785
l'll find a workaround
for the permit.

1093
00:55:53,459 --> 00:55:54,824
Heard that voice? Heard his voice?

1094
00:55:54,894 --> 00:55:56,418
He has been blessed
with a wonderful voice.

1095
00:55:56,496 --> 00:55:58,327
Go away. Sir, you're too much.

1096
00:55:58,398 --> 00:56:00,491
l stole the rascal's gun.

1097
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:02,932
Give me a role.
- Give me a role as well.

1098
00:56:02,969 --> 00:56:04,732
Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay.

1099
00:56:04,804 --> 00:56:06,965
Alright. Alright.

1100
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:10,801
Okay. Listen.
Listen. Listen carefully.

1101
00:56:10,877 --> 00:56:12,674
Listen to me very carefully.

1102
00:56:13,279 --> 00:56:17,841
All of you will get a role
in my next film. - Great.

1103
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:19,248
Great.
- Clap.

1104
00:56:19,318 --> 00:56:22,583
The film will be shot after a week.

00:56:22,789 --> 00:56:25,019
Till then all of you
make preparations.

1106
00:56:25,491 --> 00:56:26,651
What preparations, sir?

1107
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,560
Yes, what preparations?
Good question.

1108
00:56:32,732 --> 00:56:38,466
All of you will have to get six
packs like these two. - Six packs?

1109
00:56:38,838 --> 00:56:41,329
Okay. We're leaving now.

1110
00:56:41,474 --> 00:56:42,771
See you next week.

1111
00:56:43,042 --> 00:56:48,344
Okay. Bye. Move. Move.
- l got it.

1112
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,843
Someone get me down at least now.

1113
00:56:53,286 --> 00:56:54,685
Director!

1114
00:56:55,555 --> 00:56:58,524
'And the Oscar goes to Anil
Kapoor for Dumbdog Millionaire.'

1115
00:57:03,663 --> 00:57:06,928
Don't worry.

1116
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,530
My hero is like your son.

1117
00:57:09,702 --> 00:57:11,363
Just send the cheque.

1118
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:14,003
When are you visiting
Mother Goddess?

1119
00:57:14,273 --> 00:57:15,763
Darn it.
- Yes.

1120
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:18,303
You rascal..

1121
00:57:18,878 --> 00:57:20,709
This is all because of you.

1122
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:24,548
lnstead of him, l'd have
been in Hollywood today.

1123
00:57:25,852 --> 00:57:29,015
Only if you had told me
about Danny Toyle's call.

1124
00:57:29,322 --> 00:57:31,847
How could l know that
Toyle was Hollywood's Danny?

1125
00:57:32,024 --> 00:57:34,015
He said his name was Danny.

1126
00:57:34,293 --> 00:57:36,454
l thought he's Danny Denzongpa.
l drove him away.

1127
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:37,793
Bunty!

1128
00:57:37,864 --> 00:57:39,491
The phone is ringing.

1129
00:57:39,532 --> 00:57:42,695
Sir. - Yes, security. Who is it?
- Someone called Manoj is here.

1130
00:57:43,269 --> 00:57:44,896
Aatish, have you
called anyone called Manoj?

1131
00:57:45,905 --> 00:57:47,463
Ask him his full name.

1132
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:48,765
What's his full name?

1133
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:50,934
Manoj Ramalan from Hollywood.
- l see.

1134
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,705
Manoj Ramalan from Hollywood.

1135
00:57:54,847 --> 00:57:56,439
Manoj Ramalan?

1136
00:57:56,816 --> 00:57:58,909
Director of 'Sixth
Sense' has come to meet me?

1137
00:57:59,786 --> 00:58:01,219
Call him inside, you idiot.

1138
00:58:01,287 --> 00:58:02,982
Send him in.
- Yes, sir.

1139
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:08,523
l'm sure he's brought
a Hollywood offer. Yes! Yes!

1140
00:58:09,529 --> 00:58:11,497
Aatish, looks like your dream of..

1141
00:58:11,497 --> 00:58:13,658
..going to Hollywood
will be fulfilled.

1142
00:58:13,933 --> 00:58:15,491
God is great.

1143
00:58:15,735 --> 00:58:17,464
Thank God l was here.

1144
00:58:17,837 --> 00:58:19,737
Otherwise, you'd have
mistaken him for Manoj Bajpai..

1145
00:58:19,806 --> 00:58:21,273
..and driven him away.

1146
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,773
l'm not such a fool, sir.

1147
00:58:22,842 --> 00:58:25,868
Bring him in. l'll get ready.
- Yes, absolutely.

1148
00:58:31,417 --> 00:58:33,351
Who the hell are you? Who are you?

1149
00:58:33,586 --> 00:58:35,281
l'm Bunty Baweja.

1150
00:58:35,888 --> 00:58:37,617
There must be some reason.
- What?

1151
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,783
You just said Bunty
'Be-waja' (without reason).

1152
00:58:40,326 --> 00:58:43,420
Bunty Baweja.
l'm Mr. Aatish's secretary.

1153
00:58:43,496 --> 00:58:45,555
A servant.

1154
00:58:46,666 --> 00:58:48,031
You stink. Get out.

1155
00:58:48,267 --> 00:58:50,633
Where are you going?
Just tell me who you are.

1156
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:53,967
l'm Manoj Ramalan, international
film director from Hollywood.

1157
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,371
Touchwood.

1158
00:58:55,441 --> 00:58:57,739
No. No. You can't be Manoj Ramalan.

1159
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:00,504
l've seen his photographs.
He's quiet.. - Dark.

1160
00:59:00,713 --> 00:59:02,840
He's dark. l know that.
- Yes. Yes.

1161
00:59:02,915 --> 00:59:04,212
Listen, servant.

1162
00:59:04,283 --> 00:59:06,478
The person whose
pictures you've seen..

1163
00:59:06,552 --> 00:59:10,215
..is actually my younger
brother Manoj Night Ramalan.

1164
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:15,517
And l'm Manoj Day Ramalan.

1165
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:19,390
My brother was born during
the night.

1166
00:59:19,532 --> 00:59:21,397
That's why he's dark.

1167
00:59:23,236 --> 00:59:26,364
And l was born during
the day. That's why l'm..

1168
00:59:26,439 --> 00:59:27,838
That's why l'm..
- Fair.

1169
00:59:30,376 --> 00:59:31,434
Okay.

1170
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:34,245
Aatish! Where is Aatish? Aatish!

1171
00:59:34,313 --> 00:59:35,803
Search! Search! Aatish! Aatish!

1172
00:59:35,882 --> 00:59:38,783
Aatish! Aatish! Come on, fast.

1173
00:59:38,851 --> 00:59:41,251
Dear Aatish.
- Aatish.

1174
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,754
Dear Aatish.
- Aatish.

1175
00:59:48,461 --> 00:59:49,723
There he is.

1176
00:59:50,029 --> 00:59:51,553
My superstar.

1177
00:59:53,699 --> 00:59:55,792
My Oscar!

1178
00:59:57,370 --> 00:59:58,428
Oscar?

1179
00:59:58,504 --> 01:00:00,369
Yes. Oscar.

1180
01:00:01,507 --> 01:00:03,372
l've made many films in Hollywood..

1181
01:00:03,442 --> 01:00:06,741
..but l'm going to make a film
about lndia for the first time.

1182
01:00:07,513 --> 01:00:13,543
lndia's poverty and
lndia's poor superstar.

1183
01:00:13,586 --> 01:00:14,780
Sir..

1184
01:00:15,788 --> 01:00:18,313
Perfect recipe for Oscar.

1185
01:00:20,026 --> 01:00:21,516
Sir.

1186
01:00:26,699 --> 01:00:28,758
Yes?
- May l speak to Manoj Ramalan?

1187
01:00:29,068 --> 01:00:30,729
Hold on.

1188
01:00:31,337 --> 01:00:32,929
Boss, Amir (rich).

1189
01:00:33,472 --> 01:00:35,440
l got a poor guy.
l don't want a rich one.

1190
01:00:35,608 --> 01:00:39,408
Sir, Aamir Khan. That one?

1191
01:00:39,478 --> 01:00:40,809
Oh, these strugglers.

1192
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,677
Tell him.. Okay, l'll tell him.

1193
01:00:42,915 --> 01:00:46,681
Aamir, l'm making this film
especially for the Oscars. Okay?

1194
01:00:46,752 --> 01:00:48,720
l need actors who look poor. Okay?

1195
01:00:48,788 --> 01:00:49,982
l don't want you. Bye.

1196
01:00:51,457 --> 01:00:53,823
Look, what a poor guy.
What a poor guy.

1197
01:00:54,026 --> 01:00:57,826
l've decided to make this film
with Aatish Kapoor in the lead.

1198
01:00:57,897 --> 01:00:58,955
Got it?

1199
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:02,527
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1200
01:01:02,969 --> 01:01:08,032
Film? Film? Darn it! What film?
l just don't get it.

1201
01:01:08,407 --> 01:01:11,001
Why is your servant shouting at me?

1202
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:14,909
l'd rather take Aamir
than tolerate this man.

1203
01:01:14,981 --> 01:01:16,471
Call up Aamir.
- He's online.

1204
01:01:16,515 --> 01:01:18,039
No. No. Sir, not Aamir.
Please. Please.

1205
01:01:18,317 --> 01:01:19,648
Then say something to him.

1206
01:01:19,919 --> 01:01:23,548
Bunty, shout again at the director
and l'll pull your pants down.

1207
01:01:23,622 --> 01:01:25,385
Please, sir. Not my pants.

1208
01:01:25,458 --> 01:01:26,550
l just..

1209
01:01:26,692 --> 01:01:29,593
l just wanted to ask what
the story of the film is.

1210
01:01:29,862 --> 01:01:31,921
What crime have
l committed by asking that?

1211
01:01:33,799 --> 01:01:35,994
Okay. Fine. Keep Aamir on hold.

1212
01:01:36,035 --> 01:01:37,297
Hold please.

1213
01:01:37,403 --> 01:01:44,366
But if Mr. Bunty doesn't
like the Oscar winning story..

1214
01:01:44,443 --> 01:01:48,971
..then l'll give away
Aatish's Oscar to Aamir.

1215
01:01:49,048 --> 01:01:50,982
No. No. l don't want
to hear the story.

1216
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:52,347
l just need the Oscar.

1217
01:01:52,418 --> 01:01:55,854
l will narrate the story to you,
Mr. Aatish. l insist, darling.

1218
01:01:56,756 --> 01:02:01,386
The story revolves
around a great person..

1219
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:06,259
..whose name is Tees Maar Khan.

1220
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:10,296
But the story..

1221
01:02:11,637 --> 01:02:13,332
What is the story?

1222
01:02:15,541 --> 01:02:17,532
Tees Maar Khan is a revolutionary..

1223
01:02:17,576 --> 01:02:21,535
..who is involved in the greatest
revolt against the British rule.

1224
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:24,716
He robs diamonds, pearls
and jewellery worth billions.

1225
01:02:25,484 --> 01:02:27,475
An astonishing plan.

1226
01:02:27,987 --> 01:02:30,455
Nail-biting suspense.

1227
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:33,588
What?
- What is that plan?

1228
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:35,886
''Tees Maar Khan.''

1229
01:02:36,662 --> 01:02:38,061
That's the suspense.

1230
01:02:38,531 --> 01:02:40,328
l like the story.
l'm doing the film.

1231
01:02:41,534 --> 01:02:42,899
That's what l expected from you.

1232
01:02:43,502 --> 01:02:45,470
Tell Aamir he's out.

1233
01:02:46,505 --> 01:02:48,336
Sorry, Aamir. You're out.
- Oh, no.

1234
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:51,567
But what about his fees? Money?

1235
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:54,006
Aatish, put your hand on
your heart..

1236
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,911
..and tell me whether you
want money or the Oscar.

1237
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:57,312
Oscar.

1238
01:02:57,850 --> 01:02:59,044
Day ho!

1239
01:03:01,654 --> 01:03:03,884
Manoj Day.
- Day ho!

1240
01:03:04,256 --> 01:03:06,349
- Day ho!
- Day ho!

1241
01:03:06,425 --> 01:03:07,653
Sir, when are you
starting the shoot?

1242
01:03:07,726 --> 01:03:10,820
The film shoot begins next
week in the village of Dhuliya.

1243
01:03:10,896 --> 01:03:12,420
Yes.
- Where is Dhuliya? Dhuliya?

1244
01:03:12,832 --> 01:03:14,265
Where is Dhuliya?

1245
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:15,527
That's the mystery.

1246
01:03:16,435 --> 01:03:17,902
You'll get the address.

1247
01:03:18,304 --> 01:03:19,430
Day ho!
- Yes, sir.

1248
01:03:19,505 --> 01:03:20,836
Day ho!

1249
01:03:21,674 --> 01:03:23,801
Boss, we've got him as well.

1250
01:03:23,876 --> 01:03:26,276
This mission will be
a lot of fun, boss.

1251
01:03:26,412 --> 01:03:28,380
Boss, when will this mission begin?

1252
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:29,913
We start this mission..

1253
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:32,975
..soon after intermission.

1254
01:03:33,152 --> 01:03:38,715
Boss, the Khan of Khans..
- Tees Maar Khan.

1255
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:03,347
Listen, the train will pass through
here tomorrow morning at nine.

1256
01:04:03,623 --> 01:04:05,352
But are you sure
he'll get here today?

1257
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:07,354
Tell us. Why are you silent?
Answer us. Speak.

1258
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:09,891
A student copying from a textbook..

1259
01:04:09,962 --> 01:04:14,922
..and a plan hatched by Tees
Maar Khan's brain can never fail.

1260
01:04:18,871 --> 01:04:21,271
Excuse me. Can you all please move?

1261
01:04:21,841 --> 01:04:24,173
Tabrez. Tabrez.

1262
01:04:24,243 --> 01:04:25,801
Yes. Yes. Don't shout.

1263
01:04:25,845 --> 01:04:27,176
Why have you called me here?

1264
01:04:27,246 --> 01:04:28,736
There's no beauty
parlour around here.

1265
01:04:28,814 --> 01:04:31,078
lt's a surprise,
darling. Surprise. Surprise.

1266
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:32,310
Surprise?
- Yes.

1267
01:04:32,385 --> 01:04:33,909
And girls, please take care of her.

01:04:33,986 --> 01:04:35,112
Look after her, all right?

1269
01:04:35,187 --> 01:04:36,245
And yours?

1270
01:04:36,322 --> 01:04:37,755
She'll look after me.

1271
01:04:37,823 --> 01:04:38,915
Move.

1272
01:04:39,191 --> 01:04:41,216
My favourite colour. Can l call
you Pinky? - What's your name?

1273
01:04:41,293 --> 01:04:42,851
Hands up!

1274
01:04:44,296 --> 01:04:47,094
Mr. Director, what do you
think about my dialogue?

1275
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:48,224
Very, very good.

1276
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,562
Say this dialogue
in the entire movie.

1277
01:04:49,669 --> 01:04:50,829
''Hands up. Hands up.'' Go on.
- Hand up!

1278
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:51,928
Get scared.

1279
01:04:52,038 --> 01:04:53,062
They got scared.
- They got scared. Go on.

1280
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:54,231
Go on, December.

1281

Now scare the villagers.
Yes, whatever. - Hands up.

1282

Aatish Kapoor is coming!
Look, there's the helicopter.

1283
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:07,646
Boss, he's coming.

01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,881
Where? Where?
- l'll get the band started.

1285
01:05:09,955 --> 01:05:11,252
Not there, over here.

1286
01:05:11,323 --> 01:05:14,087
Play the music!
Aatish Kapoor is here.

1287
01:05:18,764 --> 01:05:20,026
Aatish Kapoor?

1288
01:05:20,633 --> 01:05:22,965
Yes, l'm making a film with
Aatish Kapoor in the lead.

1289
01:05:23,035 --> 01:05:26,061
What?
- And you're his heroine.

1290
01:05:27,139 --> 01:05:28,231

1291
01:05:28,307 --> 01:05:29,899
Not in public. Not in public.

Aatish!

1293
01:05:45,291 --> 01:05:47,156
''Here he comes.''

1294
01:05:47,626 --> 01:05:49,116
''Here he comes.''

''Here he comes.''

1299
01:06:07,113 --> 01:06:08,205
Hello.

..please get to the railway tracks.

1310
01:06:40,546 --> 01:06:41,706
We'll have your film shoot.

1311
01:06:41,781 --> 01:06:42,839
Tell these people.

1312
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:44,280
Tell them. Tell them.

1313
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:58,627
Move! There's a film shoot here.

1314
01:06:58,697 --> 01:06:59,925
Pick up the camera.

1315
01:07:00,833 --> 01:07:03,734
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Just dust in the eyes.

1316
01:07:03,869 --> 01:07:05,029
Don't overreact.

1317
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,628
Move! There's a film shoot here.

1318
01:07:06,705 --> 01:07:09,003
Move. Move. The heroine is coming.

1319
01:07:09,074 --> 01:07:11,838
Can't you see? Move.

1320
01:07:11,911 --> 01:07:13,173
The heroine is coming. Move.

1321
01:07:13,245 --> 01:07:14,712
l got it. l got it.

1322
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,247
Mr. Aatish, l've asked
the whole of Hollywood.

1323
01:07:18,918 --> 01:07:22,854
Nobody has even heard
of Manoj Day Ramalan.

1324
01:07:23,656 --> 01:07:25,920
Sir, l feel he's a big fraud.

1325
01:07:25,991 --> 01:07:27,686
Enough. Enough. Enough!

1326
01:07:28,227 --> 01:07:30,787
You thought Danny
Toyle was Danny Denzongpa..

1327
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:32,627
..and you drove him away,
you duffer.

1328
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:33,890
Sorry, sir.

1329
01:07:34,767 --> 01:07:36,064
These Oscar types are like that.

1330
01:07:36,168 --> 01:07:37,897
Look at him, man. Look at him.

1331
01:07:37,937 --> 01:07:39,598
And the villagers
will lie on the track..

1332
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:42,569
He's a genius.

1333
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:45,132
From here..
- Hands up!

1334
01:07:46,779 --> 01:07:48,007
Have you lost it?

1335
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:49,638
Just look at my X-Factor.

1336
01:07:49,715 --> 01:07:51,683
Stick an X on your mouth.
That would make it triple X.

1337
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,115
Very good idea, sir.
- Yes. Go on. Go.

1338
01:07:53,185 --> 01:07:55,779
Heroines look better when
fully clothed. Take this.

1339
01:07:56,255 --> 01:07:57,552
Tabrez.
- What?

1340
01:07:57,623 --> 01:07:59,614
When will you
introduce me to Mr. Aatish?

1341
01:07:59,758 --> 01:08:00,782
Rascal.

1342
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:01,986
After the film shoot gets over.

1343
01:08:03,696 --> 01:08:05,095
He's so mean.

1344
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:06,256
Charlie, come in!

1345
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:07,594
Charlie! Charlie!

1346
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:08,724
Do you read me?

1347
01:08:08,801 --> 01:08:09,893
Charlie! Charlie!

1348
01:08:09,969 --> 01:08:11,732
Charlie isn't here.
Will Johri Brothers do?

1349
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:14,931
Hello, boss.
lt's me, Romeo speaking.

1350
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:16,334
Yes, Romeo.
Tell us what's the news?

1351
01:08:16,642 --> 01:08:17,836
Boss, very bad news.

1352
01:08:17,943 --> 01:08:19,342
The train isn't coming
with the antiques today.

1353
01:08:20,112 --> 01:08:21,773
Train isn't coming today? Why?

1354
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:25,283
The police commissioner has delayed
the train for security reasons.

1355
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:26,613
So when will it come?

1356
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:27,913
A week later.

1357
01:08:27,987 --> 01:08:29,079
What?

1358
01:08:29,889 --> 01:08:31,356
Okay, boss. Over and out.

1359
01:08:31,757 --> 01:08:32,951
What? How many overs?
And who got out?

1360
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:34,083
Hello? Hello?

1361
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:35,251
Hello? Hello?

1362
01:08:35,728 --> 01:08:36,854
Which two teams were
playing the match today?

1363
01:08:38,664 --> 01:08:39,892
There's bad news.

1364
01:08:40,165 --> 01:08:41,757
What could be worse than you?
Tell me.

1365
01:08:41,901 --> 01:08:43,766
The train isn't coming today.

1366
01:08:43,802 --> 01:08:44,996
What?

1367
01:08:46,605 --> 01:08:47,697
Then?

1368
01:08:47,773 --> 01:08:49,798
The train will come with
the antiques next week.

1369
01:08:49,942 --> 01:08:53,537
So what are we supposed to
do for a week? Lay eggs?

1370
01:08:53,812 --> 01:08:54,904
No.

1371
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,242
Aren't you the director?

1372
01:08:56,682 --> 01:08:58,081
Shoot the film.

1373
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:01,846
Shoot the film? With these idiots.
- Bye-bye.

1374
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:03,252
l'll go crazy.

1375
01:09:28,013 --> 01:09:30,345
''Tees Maar Khan.''

1376
01:09:30,716 --> 01:09:32,047
Day ho!

1377
01:09:32,117 --> 01:09:36,679
''Tees Maar Khan.''

1378
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:38,746
Boss, we are with you.
- Yes, boss.

1379
01:09:38,891 --> 01:09:40,051
Really, boys?
- Yes.

1382
01:09:43,529 --> 01:09:45,019
l'll slap all three of you.

1383
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:46,564
Boss.

1384
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:50,829
Until we steal the antiques,
we won't leave this village.

1385
01:09:50,903 --> 01:09:52,234
What do we do till then?

1386
01:09:52,805 --> 01:09:54,602
Aren't l the director?
- Yes.

1387
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:56,138
Let's play shooting-shooting.

1388
01:09:56,208 --> 01:09:57,539
Boss.

1389
01:09:58,544 --> 01:09:59,806
lt's a romantic scene, you rascals.

1390
01:09:59,878 --> 01:10:01,038
Sorry, boss.
- Come on.

Who is she?

1402
01:10:52,898 --> 01:10:55,128
Let me start the

01:10:57,236 --> 01:10:59,227
Now we'll start the film shoot.

1404

Yes, all right.

1411
01:11:15,687 --> 01:11:17,712

1412
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:19,757
Action!

1413
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:20,916
No! No!

1414
01:11:22,895 --> 01:11:26,695
Yo, Day! What do l have to do?

1415
01:11:28,934 --> 01:11:30,094

1416
01:11:30,302 --> 01:11:32,133
Stop the camera! ldiot!

1417
01:11:32,304 --> 01:11:33,999
Camera cut. Lights cut.

1418
01:11:34,173 --> 01:11:38,803
Cut. Cut. Cut.

1419
01:11:38,911 --> 01:11:40,572
Stop it. Take the camera away.

1420
01:11:40,646 --> 01:11:43,137
Don't want to shoot. ls
this the way? Nonsense.

1421
01:11:43,215 --> 01:11:45,649
Everything is futile. Everything..

1422
01:11:45,784 --> 01:11:46,876
Cool. Cool.

1423
01:11:47,019 --> 01:11:49,010
Cool. Cool.

1424
01:11:54,793 --> 01:11:55,885
Aatish.

1425
01:11:58,097 --> 01:11:59,291
Good question, Aatish.

1426
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:01,563
You asked a wonderful question.

1427
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,800
You'll surely bag
the Oscar next year.

1428
01:12:07,106 --> 01:12:09,631
Day Ho!
- Day Ho! Day Ho!

1429
01:12:09,975 --> 01:12:11,203
Day Ho!

1430
01:12:13,278 --> 01:12:14,768
But what do l have to do?

1431
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:15,938
Good question again.

1432
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,277
Silence. Silence.

1433
01:12:19,551 --> 01:12:20,711
The director is thinking.

1434
01:12:20,819 --> 01:12:22,582
He's thinking. He's thinking.

1435
01:12:30,829 --> 01:12:32,820
''Tees Maar Khan.''

1436
01:12:36,235 --> 01:12:39,727
Got it! Got it! Got it!
Got it! He got it!

1437
01:12:39,771 --> 01:12:41,830
Come on, move.
Everyone will get it.

1438
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:45,876
Then l'll bring the camera
down and take it back up again.

1439
01:12:45,944 --> 01:12:48,936
And then turn around.

1440
01:12:50,582 --> 01:12:51,742
This is too much, man.

1441
01:12:52,151 --> 01:12:54,016
Will he change
locations all the time..

1442
01:12:54,086 --> 01:12:55,644
..or will he also
start the shoot, sir?

1443
01:12:55,921 --> 01:12:58,151
And then l'll take
a shot from here.

1444
01:12:58,223 --> 01:12:59,520
Director.
- Yes?

1445
01:12:59,591 --> 01:13:00,922
Here are the keys to the bank.

1446
01:13:00,993 --> 01:13:02,187
Might come in handy
for your film shoot.

1447
01:13:02,261 --> 01:13:03,523
Yes, all right.

1448
01:13:03,595 --> 01:13:04,653
Thank you.
- Thank you.

1449
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:05,890
Come. Come. Come.

1450
01:13:06,031 --> 01:13:07,521
''Tees Maar Khan.''

1451
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:08,861
Sir.
- Yes?

1452
01:13:09,001 --> 01:13:10,525
What's the scene?
At least tell us.

1453
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:13,036
We'll just do
the bank robbery today.

1454
01:13:13,105 --> 01:13:14,197
Bank robbery?

1455
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:17,673
Sir, is this a film about
bandits or revolutionaries?

1456
01:13:18,577 --> 01:13:20,704
But aren't l a revolutionary
in the film?

1457
01:13:23,715 --> 01:13:25,774
Good question. Very good question.

1458
01:13:26,552 --> 01:13:30,648
You're the revolutionary
and this is a British bank.

1459
01:13:32,291 --> 01:13:34,191
Bank? l don't get it.

1460
01:13:35,861 --> 01:13:37,624
Look, you're a revolutionary..

1461
01:13:37,696 --> 01:13:41,097
..you get in the bank, you
rob money from the British..

1462
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:44,192
..and distribute it
to the poor lndians.

1463
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:48,901
Poor lndian.

1464
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:50,933
Oscar! Oscar! Oscar!

1465
01:13:50,976 --> 01:13:52,102
Day ho! l got it!

1466
01:13:52,144 --> 01:13:53,236
Day ho! Day ho! Day ho!

1467
01:13:53,278 --> 01:13:54,336
What am l doing in this scene?

1468
01:13:54,646 --> 01:13:58,810
Yes, you're a British lady.

1469
01:13:58,917 --> 01:14:00,077
British lady?
- Yes.

1470
01:14:00,986 --> 01:14:02,214
So why would she rob the bank?

1471
01:14:02,287 --> 01:14:03,686
Why would she rob the bank?

1472
01:14:03,755 --> 01:14:04,813
Why would she rob the bank?

1473
01:14:04,856 --> 01:14:08,155
Because her father is lndian.
He's an lndian.

1474
01:14:08,227 --> 01:14:12,186
Aatish and she will together
loot the British government.

1475
01:14:12,631 --> 01:14:14,724
Wow! l'll go enhance my make-up.

1476
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,768
Yes. Yes. Go on.
Go smear some more. Quickly.

1477
01:14:16,835 --> 01:14:18,928
British government!
British government!

1478
01:14:19,137 --> 01:14:21,128
Can't see a single
foreigner over here, sir.

1479
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:23,174
Your secretary too
asks good questions.

1480
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:30,375
Director, me!

1481
01:14:33,752 --> 01:14:35,219
Got it! Got him!

1482
01:14:35,387 --> 01:14:36,684
There he is.

1483
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:38,121
My British sweeper.

1484
01:14:42,094 --> 01:14:43,322
My actor. Bring him.

1485
01:14:43,595 --> 01:14:44,857
Come here. Come here.

1486
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:47,160
Your life is set. Come on.

1487
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:48,790
Here's our foreigner.

1488
01:14:49,601 --> 01:14:52,832
Day, this is a villager.
How will he speak English?

1489
01:14:55,307 --> 01:14:57,798
Good question. Very good question.

1490
01:14:59,278 --> 01:15:00,768
Put a chewing gum in his mouth.

1491
01:15:01,613 --> 01:15:02,671
Yes, boss.

1492
01:15:04,616 --> 01:15:05,674
Chew it.

1493
01:15:05,984 --> 01:15:09,078
l can talk English. Do you want
to listen to my English?

1494
01:15:09,955 --> 01:15:11,650
Yes. Yes.

1495
01:15:11,790 --> 01:15:13,724
English. English. English.

1496
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:16,994
Get him ready now for the shoot.
- Okay, boss.

1497
01:15:17,129 --> 01:15:20,098
Take him back and action!

1498
01:15:21,366 --> 01:15:25,735
But Day, what do
l have to do in this scene?

1499
01:15:25,804 --> 01:15:27,328
Aatish. Aatish. Aatish.

1500
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:30,268
Don't ask what you have to do.

1501
01:15:30,742 --> 01:15:35,805
Ask what you've done
for your country.

1502
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:38,146
What?
- Yes.

1503
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:41,548
Close your eyes.
- Why?

1504
01:15:41,887 --> 01:15:45,118
Aatish, l'm telling you.
For my sake. Close your eyes.

1505
01:15:47,092 --> 01:15:48,150
Good boy.

1506
01:15:48,226 --> 01:15:55,564
Now imagine that the British
are ruling lndia for many years.

1507
01:15:57,669 --> 01:16:00,297
They're oppressing
simple and innocent lndians.

1508
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:03,237
No.

1509
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:07,244
They've riddled lndia, our
motherland, with bullets.

1510
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:08,802
Mother.
- Mother.

1511
01:16:08,847 --> 01:16:10,109
Yes.
- No!

1512
01:16:10,182 --> 01:16:14,585
They've even killed
our women and children.

1513
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:16,949
No! No!

1514
01:16:17,022 --> 01:16:20,082
Take the shot. Boss, take the shot.
- Yes.

1515
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:21,853
Action!

1516
01:16:44,316 --> 01:16:45,874
Aatish.

1517
01:17:14,112 --> 01:17:17,104
You British! Rascal!

1518
01:17:24,823 --> 01:17:26,620
You British! Rascal!

1519
01:17:26,758 --> 01:17:30,159
Where is the hard-earned
money of the poor lndians?

1520
01:17:30,295 --> 01:17:32,957
Tell me! Tell me!

1521
01:17:33,031 --> 01:17:35,329
Perhaps, he doesn't
understand Hindi.

1522
01:17:35,667 --> 01:17:36,861
Let me try.

1523
01:17:37,969 --> 01:17:39,630
You dirty dog!

1524
01:17:39,704 --> 01:17:44,300
Tell me. Where is the hard-earned
money of the poor lndians?

1525
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:46,305
Tell me. Tell me. Speak!

1526
01:17:46,578 --> 01:17:48,136
Control. Control.

1527
01:17:48,313 --> 01:17:49,871
Get up.

1528
01:17:50,182 --> 01:17:52,173
Chew. Chew.

1529
01:17:52,717 --> 01:17:55,777
What will you poor
lndians do with the money?

1530
01:17:55,821 --> 01:17:58,813
Followers of non-violence.
You can't even buy guns.

1531
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:01,620
You roam naked wearing
handmade cloth.

1532
01:18:02,694 --> 01:18:05,026
Hit the British officer.

1533
01:18:05,096 --> 01:18:06,188
How was that?

1534
01:18:06,331 --> 01:18:09,095
My naked hand on your naked cheek?

1535
01:18:09,167 --> 01:18:13,001
Very nice. l'll go get
the money now.

1536
01:18:14,573 --> 01:18:17,133
Wide shot. Wide shot. Wide shot.

1537
01:18:17,876 --> 01:18:19,104
Keep going. Keep going.

1538
01:18:19,177 --> 01:18:20,610
Start the camera.

1539
01:18:23,114 --> 01:18:24,911
Forgive me.
- Get out!

1540
01:18:35,126 --> 01:18:37,060
Will you fire a cannon at me?

1541
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:41,928
Fire it at my chest
if you have the guts.

1542
01:18:42,033 --> 01:18:44,194
Boss, he's become insane. Stop him.

1543
01:18:44,269 --> 01:18:46,999
Fire it if you have the guts.

1544
01:18:47,072 --> 01:18:48,767
Boss, cut. Cut it.

1545
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,603
Cut. Cut.

1546
01:18:50,675 --> 01:18:52,870
Fire! Fire!

1547
01:18:52,944 --> 01:18:56,971
Dyer, fire it if you
have any self-respect.

1548
01:18:57,048 --> 01:18:59,312
Cut!

1549
01:18:59,584 --> 01:19:01,176
Boss!

1550
01:19:04,556 --> 01:19:06,114
Cut!

1551
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:08,758
Fire! Fire!

1552
01:19:09,294 --> 01:19:10,955
No.
- Cut!

1553
01:19:11,096 --> 01:19:14,065
Fire!

1554
01:19:14,132 --> 01:19:15,690

1556
01:19:29,114 --> 01:19:30,240
Sorry, Day.

1557
01:19:30,315 --> 01:19:32,306
l just got into the character.

1558
01:19:32,951 --> 01:19:34,748
l thought you'd get
into the camera.

1559
01:19:34,819 --> 01:19:38,311
But what a performance.
What a performance.

1560
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:40,055
Oscar award-winning performance.

1561
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:41,183
And my performance?

1562
01:19:41,259 --> 01:19:42,954
You'll get a Rotary Club award.

1563
01:19:43,094 --> 01:19:44,891
Well, l'll go write my speech.

1564
01:19:44,963 --> 01:19:46,260
Go. Go on quickly.

1565
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:47,623
Sir, l'll go change.

1566
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:49,530
Yes, go change. Go dry yourself.

1567
01:19:49,601 --> 01:19:50,659
Listen to me.

1568
01:19:50,735 --> 01:19:52,134
Love you, sir. l love you.

1569
01:19:54,606 --> 01:19:55,698
He's crazy.

1570
01:19:55,774 --> 01:19:57,173
Excuse me, boss. Need to tell
you something important. - Tell me.

1571
01:19:57,242 --> 01:19:58,300
The film is over.

1572
01:19:58,577 --> 01:19:59,635
l'll slap you, okay?

1573
01:19:59,711 --> 01:20:01,235
The film won't get over
until we loot the goods.

1574
01:20:01,313 --> 01:20:02,610
No. No. Not that stuff.

1575
01:20:02,681 --> 01:20:04,012
The film that goes in the camera.

1576
01:20:04,649 --> 01:20:06,276
The negatives?
- Yes, we've run out of those.

1577
01:20:06,651 --> 01:20:08,050
The stock that
we stole from Mumbai..

1578
01:20:08,119 --> 01:20:10,144
l mean, boss,
the stock we brought..

1579
01:20:10,221 --> 01:20:11,916
We've run out of that. Boss,
l have an idea.

1580
01:20:11,990 --> 01:20:13,719
Let's shoot without the stock.
What would they know?

1581
01:20:13,792 --> 01:20:14,781
That's better.

1582
01:20:15,026 --> 01:20:16,084
No.

1583
01:20:16,194 --> 01:20:18,662
Aatish and Bunty have been in
the film industry for ten years.

1584
01:20:18,863 --> 01:20:20,558
We might handle Aatish.

1585
01:20:20,632 --> 01:20:22,031
But Bunty will understand
immediately.

1586
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:23,192
Boss, what do we do then?

1587
01:20:23,268 --> 01:20:24,735
We'll have to bring
the stuff from the city.

1588
01:20:24,869 --> 01:20:26,131
We've also run out of money.

1589
01:20:26,271 --> 01:20:28,068
We have to shoot for
another five to six days.

1590
01:20:28,139 --> 01:20:29,800
So we'll need at least
Rs.500,000 to Rs.600,000.

1591
01:20:32,277 --> 01:20:33,335
What's that?

1592
01:20:33,612 --> 01:20:35,170
Boss, the keys to the bank.

1593
01:20:35,246 --> 01:20:37,840
The bank manager Santram
himself gave it to us.

1594
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:39,144
What do you think, boss?

1595
01:20:39,284 --> 01:20:41,582
Wonderful suggestion. Well done.

1596
01:20:41,653 --> 01:20:43,177
Boss, what if something goes wrong?

1597
01:20:43,254 --> 01:20:45,586
lf you're not good looking,
you should say good things.

1598
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,251
lt's Friday today.

1599
01:20:47,592 --> 01:20:48,889
The bank will be closed
for the next two days.

1600
01:20:48,994 --> 01:20:50,188
lt's a bank holiday on Monday.

1601
01:20:50,228 --> 01:20:51,661
We'll be robbing
the train on Tuesday.

1602
01:20:51,730 --> 01:20:52,788
The whole village will be there.

1603
01:20:52,864 --> 01:20:55,196
Nobody will know before Wednesday
that we've robbed the bank.

1604
01:20:55,266 --> 01:20:57,166
And we would've left
with the goods.

1605
01:20:57,569 --> 01:20:59,036
And we'd have been
relaxing somewhere.

1606
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:00,298
Boss!
- Wonderful.

1607
01:21:00,572 --> 01:21:02,096
Enough. Enough.

1608
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:04,165
God has been so kind to us, Nana..

1609
01:21:04,242 --> 01:21:06,870
..that this film crew came to
Dhuliya to shoot for their film.

1610
01:21:06,945 --> 01:21:09,846
That day is not too far, when
tourists will come to Dhuliya..

1611
01:21:09,914 --> 01:21:11,882
..on a holiday or on honeymoon.

1612
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:16,785
Yes. And soon we'll
have good business.

1613
01:21:17,155 --> 01:21:18,884
Listen. Listen.

1614
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:20,921
The film shoot that was
supposed to take place..

1615
01:21:20,992 --> 01:21:22,323
..will not happen now.

1616
01:21:22,594 --> 01:21:23,788
What?
- Yes.

1617
01:21:24,796 --> 01:21:27,321
Quietly. Quietly.
- What? Should l stop walking now?

1618
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:30,629
Boss, looks like he's dead.

1619
01:21:30,735 --> 01:21:32,669
ls he your nephew? ''He's dead.''

1620
01:21:32,771 --> 01:21:34,033
Get in.

1621
01:21:34,072 --> 01:21:35,937
Come on. Quickly. Quickly.

1622
01:21:36,207 --> 01:21:39,574
You know what, Mummy? The hero
of the film is Aatish Kapoor.

1623
01:21:40,612 --> 01:21:41,806
But the main role is mine.

1624
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:45,111
Do you know that l was a big
fan of Aatish Kapoor's father?

1625
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:47,709
l'll also come for your film shoot.

1626
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:49,753
After all, l'm the
director's mother.

1627
01:21:49,788 --> 01:21:51,187
Well, where is your
film shoot taking place?

1628
01:21:52,624 --> 01:21:55,593
Girls, where are we?
- Dhuliya.

1629
01:21:57,829 --> 01:22:00,696
Dhuliya.
- Dhuliya? l'll drop by over there.

1630
01:22:01,032 --> 01:22:03,262
ls the film shoot
going well? Take care. Bye.

1631
01:22:03,535 --> 01:22:06,095
Okay, Mummy. Bye.

1632
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:08,002
My mother-in-low.

1633
01:22:08,073 --> 01:22:11,065
Listen, have any of
you seen the director?

1634
01:22:11,142 --> 01:22:12,666
Yes, l've seen him. l've seen him.

1635
01:22:12,811 --> 01:22:15,041
He and his three friends
have gone towards the bank.

1636
01:22:15,213 --> 01:22:17,204
Bank! Bank?

1637
01:22:17,716 --> 01:22:21,311
Close the door.
Our job is done. Come on.

1638
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:27,249
Boss, looks like they've
found out about our plan.

1639
01:22:27,325 --> 01:22:28,656
What do we do now, boss?

1640
01:22:28,893 --> 01:22:30,918
There's only one thing you
can do in such a situation.

1641
01:22:30,995 --> 01:22:32,292
What?

1642
01:22:32,564 --> 01:22:33,758
Run!

1643
01:22:33,798 --> 01:22:35,925
Run! Run! Run!

1644
01:22:36,334 --> 01:22:37,926
Mummy.

1645
01:22:38,937 --> 01:22:40,495
Run!

1646
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,736
Look. There's the director.
- Where?

1647
01:22:44,776 --> 01:22:46,607
They're going towards
the dark jungle.

1648
01:22:46,745 --> 01:22:48,679
Oh, God! Somebody stop them.

1649
01:22:48,747 --> 01:22:50,578
That is the jungle
of the Headless Ghost.

1650
01:22:50,648 --> 01:22:52,172
Will somebody stop him..

1651
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:54,718
..or do l have to do
that as well? Come on.

1652
01:22:54,786 --> 01:22:56,185
Where are you going?

1653
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:58,781
Director! Stop!

1654
01:22:58,857 --> 01:23:01,553
Director. Don't go that way.

1655
01:23:01,626 --> 01:23:05,653
Stop!
- lt will kill you!

1656
01:23:05,764 --> 01:23:07,698
Heard that? They will kill us. Run!

1657
01:23:07,799 --> 01:23:09,926
They will kill us.

1658
01:23:10,001 --> 01:23:11,628
Boss, run!

1659
01:23:11,703 --> 01:23:13,295
ldiots, stop.

1660
01:23:13,571 --> 01:23:15,937
Director, stop! Stop.
- Run!

1661
01:23:16,708 --> 01:23:19,700
l'll run faster than you.
ldiots. You never stop.

1662
01:23:19,878 --> 01:23:23,609
l'll not stop for you.
- Boss! - Run!

1663
01:23:25,550 --> 01:23:27,711
They're going deeper
into the woods.

1664
01:23:27,786 --> 01:23:29,083
But why aren't they stopping?

1665
01:23:29,154 --> 01:23:31,952
lnspector, you come with us as well.
- Yes, come on.

1666
01:23:33,057 --> 01:23:36,049
What's going on?
Why haven't you stopped them yet?

1667
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:38,619
Our boys have gone
to the dark jungle.

1668
01:23:38,663 --> 01:23:40,255
For me, every jungle is dark.

1669
01:23:40,799 --> 01:23:42,664
Boss!
- Run!

1670
01:23:42,734 --> 01:23:43,962
Boss!

1671
01:23:53,812 --> 01:23:55,074
Boss!

1672
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,151
Oh, God! Ghost!

1673
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:14,765
Ghost!

1674
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:16,994
Headless Ghost!

1675
01:24:17,101 --> 01:24:19,729
Ghost! Run! Ghost!

1676
01:24:26,845 --> 01:24:28,369
Headless ghost!

1677
01:24:29,247 --> 01:24:33,013
Ghost! Run! Don't stop! Run!

1678
01:24:33,084 --> 01:24:35,780
Run. Ghost!

1679
01:24:37,222 --> 01:24:39,156
''Tees Maar Khan.''

1680
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:41,291
Run.

1681
01:24:41,559 --> 01:24:43,322
Where is boss going?

1682
01:24:43,728 --> 01:24:44,820
After the ghost.

1683
01:24:44,896 --> 01:24:45,988
Boss has gone crazy.

1684
01:24:46,064 --> 01:24:47,725
Run!
- Run!

1685
01:24:47,799 --> 01:24:49,323
Stop! Stop!
- What happened?

1686
01:24:49,601 --> 01:24:52,798
Look. The director is going
towards the ghost. - What?

1687
01:25:01,746 --> 01:25:04,010
Boss is in danger.
We should help him.

1688
01:25:04,082 --> 01:25:06,141
But that's a ghost over there.

1689
01:25:06,217 --> 01:25:07,582
That's exactly
why we should help him.

1690
01:25:07,652 --> 01:25:09,313
Had it been a human,
boss would've handled him.

1691
01:25:19,097 --> 01:25:21,827
The Director has gone to
fight the ghost for us.

1692
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:23,891
We should lend him support.

1693
01:25:23,968 --> 01:25:25,367
He's right. He's right.

1694
01:25:25,803 --> 01:25:27,668
Attack!

1695
01:25:27,739 --> 01:25:30,299
Attack!

1696
01:25:39,183 --> 01:25:40,309
He ran away.

1697
01:25:42,053 --> 01:25:44,021
Attack!

1698
01:25:44,088 --> 01:25:46,056
Attack!

1699
01:25:54,933 --> 01:25:56,594
Attack!

1700
01:25:56,734 --> 01:25:57,928
Attack!

1701
01:25:58,002 --> 01:25:59,230
Easy.
- Boss.

1702
01:25:59,604 --> 01:26:00,798
Boss, what's happening?

1703
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:02,031
How would boss know?

1704
01:26:06,611 --> 01:26:07,873
What's going on here?

1705
01:26:07,946 --> 01:26:09,709
Yes. What's going on here?

1706
01:26:09,781 --> 01:26:11,806
Catch them! Attack!

1707
01:26:11,849 --> 01:26:13,817
Attack!

1708
01:26:13,851 --> 01:26:15,011
Attack!

1709
01:26:15,086 --> 01:26:16,781
Are you crazy? Get out!

1710
01:26:30,601 --> 01:26:33,195
You.. What's going on here?
What's going on? Tell me.

1711
01:26:33,604 --> 01:26:35,834
Tell us. Speak. Speak.

1712
01:26:36,674 --> 01:26:39,370
Tell us. Speak.
Who are you? Speak.

1713
01:26:46,684 --> 01:26:48,777
What? This is Chenu's son.

1714
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:50,785
He'd disappeared last year.

1715
01:26:51,222 --> 01:26:54,191
And we thought he
drowned in the river.

1716
01:26:54,625 --> 01:26:57,321
Gopal? My son Gopal.

1717
01:26:57,695 --> 01:26:59,060
Father! Father!

1718
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:00,324
Come, my son.

1719
01:27:00,565 --> 01:27:02,897
Look. They both are Laxman's sons.

1720
01:27:02,967 --> 01:27:04,935
Munnu! My son Munnu.

1721
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:08,829
Come here, headless ghost.

1722
01:27:08,906 --> 01:27:10,100
Remove his head!

1723
01:27:10,341 --> 01:27:11,706
Tell me. Tell me.

1724
01:27:11,776 --> 01:27:14,006
What's going on here?
Tell me. Tell me.

1725
01:27:14,345 --> 01:27:15,642
l'll tell you.

1726
01:27:17,115 --> 01:27:18,673
We grow marijuana here.

1727
01:27:19,751 --> 01:27:23,847
We abducted all these
kids from your village..

1728
01:27:23,921 --> 01:27:25,616
..so that they can work for us.

1729
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:27,348
And we'd spread the
terror of the headless ghost..

1730
01:27:27,625 --> 01:27:32,085
..so that the villagers
wouldn't venture into this jungle.

1731
01:27:33,598 --> 01:27:38,228
Shame on us.
We couldn't do anything, Subedar.

1732
01:27:39,137 --> 01:27:41,264
Had it not been for our director..

1733
01:27:41,706 --> 01:27:43,799
''Tees Maar Khan.''

1734
01:27:54,786 --> 01:28:01,783
You risked your life for us
and faced such great danger.

1735
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:10,133
We've never seen such
a brave person. - Yes.

1736
01:28:10,301 --> 01:28:14,067
We'll always be indebted to you.

1737
01:28:14,605 --> 01:28:17,005
But we can surely do our bit.

1738
01:28:18,342 --> 01:28:19,673
What's this?

1739
01:28:19,744 --> 01:28:20,836
No.

1740
01:28:20,912 --> 01:28:24,643
Santram told us that

People of Dhuliya, after
today you're no ordinary humans..

1883
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:12,175
You're artists.

1884
01:36:14,618 --> 01:36:17,678
Every old person, every child..

1885
01:36:17,755 --> 01:36:19,916
..and every young
person of this village..

1886
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:22,584
..will become immortal
on the big screen forever.

1887
01:36:25,129 --> 01:36:27,927
The scene we're going to
shoot today..

1888
01:36:27,998 --> 01:36:29,989
..is the soul of this film.

1889
01:36:30,067 --> 01:36:33,059
That is the most important scene.

1890
01:36:33,137 --> 01:36:35,128

01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:51,783
The British regiment will be

1895
01:36:52,323 --> 01:36:56,623
The officers of this
regiment look like us lndians.

1896
01:36:56,994 --> 01:36:59,895
But don't get taken in
by their innocent faces.

1897
01:37:00,564 --> 01:37:05,661
They are servants of
the British government.

01:37:07,571 --> 01:37:10,904
And you all are revolutionaries..

1899
01:37:13,243 --> 01:37:15,211

01:37:15,279 --> 01:37:18,077
..and loot the treasure
inside of it.

1901
01:37:19,149 --> 01:37:21,242
Listen to him, sir. Loot again.

1902
01:37:21,318 --> 01:37:22,945
First the bank. Now the train.

1903
01:37:23,354 --> 01:37:26,118
Darn it! ls 'Bharat Ka Khazana'

1904
01:37:26,290 --> 01:37:28,656
..or is it 'Chori Mera Kaam'?
Son of a gun!

1905
01:37:29,994 --> 01:37:32,258
The train is speeding.

1906
01:37:33,230 --> 01:37:35,164
Quickly, you scoundrels.

1907
01:37:36,667 --> 01:37:42,697
Chief, hand over
your flag to Aatish.

1908
01:37:42,773 --> 01:37:44,206
That too in slow motion.

1909
01:37:44,875 --> 01:37:46,308
Aatish.

1910
01:37:46,677 --> 01:37:47,871
Boss.

1911
01:37:47,945 --> 01:37:50,140
With the flag in hand,
you'll stand..

1912
01:37:50,214 --> 01:37:51,647
..right in the middle of
the tracks.

1913
01:37:51,715 --> 01:37:53,706
That too in slow motion. Show me.

1914
01:37:54,652 --> 01:37:56,552
That's more like it.

1915
01:37:56,754 --> 01:37:59,245
Upon seeing you right in
the middle of the tracks..

1916
01:37:59,590 --> 01:38:02,650
..the troubled train
driver will blow the whistle.

1917
01:38:04,595 --> 01:38:05,823
Well done. Well done.

1918
01:38:05,896 --> 01:38:07,955
But you won't budge.

1919
01:38:08,065 --> 01:38:09,327
Never!

1920
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:12,567
An passion for independence
is burning inside of you.

1921
01:38:12,836 --> 01:38:15,304
And you'll shout aloud.

1922
01:38:15,572 --> 01:38:17,802
Long live the revolution!

1923
01:38:17,841 --> 01:38:19,934
Long live the revolution!

1924
01:38:20,210 --> 01:38:23,270
Listen, on my mark
all the villagers..

1925
01:38:23,347 --> 01:38:27,283
..will pounce on the
train like hungry wolves.

1926
01:38:27,351 --> 01:38:28,648
Got it?

1927
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:31,882
And tear away the uniforms
of those British officers.

1928
01:38:31,955 --> 01:38:35,049
Unload all the stuff from the
train and load it in this truck.

1929
01:38:35,192 --> 01:38:37,057
And me? What will l do?

1930
01:38:37,261 --> 01:38:38,819
You. You.

1931
01:38:39,029 --> 01:38:41,156
You're Razia Sultan.
- Listen.

1932
01:38:41,231 --> 01:38:44,098
Wow! Who is she?

1933
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:45,226
Who is she?

1934
01:38:45,302 --> 01:38:46,564
Bahadur Shah Zafar's daughter.

1935
01:38:46,637 --> 01:38:48,070
Bahadur Shah Zafar's daughter.

1936
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:51,073
And all this
treasure is your father's.

1937
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:52,675
Wonderful!

1938
01:38:52,876 --> 01:38:54,275
Let me put on some more rollers.

1939
01:38:54,545 --> 01:38:55,739
Yes, go do that. Go on.

1940
01:38:57,781 --> 01:39:00,545
lf she is Razia Sultan,
then who the hell am l?

1941
01:39:00,617 --> 01:39:01,743
'Chacha Chaudhary'
(comic character)?

1942
01:39:01,785 --> 01:39:03,116
No! Sheikh Chilli.

1943
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:05,015
Hands up!

1944
01:39:06,123 --> 01:39:07,988
He'll put us in trouble.
What is it?

1945
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:10,183
The train is coming, sir.

1946
01:39:13,630 --> 01:39:14,961
Yes.

1947
01:39:45,262 --> 01:39:48,129
The train is coming,
Subedar! The train is coming!

1948
01:39:48,799 --> 01:39:53,099
For the first time you've told
me something without being asked.

1949
01:39:53,604 --> 01:39:55,231
..without being asked.

1950
01:40:05,315 --> 01:40:06,873
God!

1951
01:40:07,050 --> 01:40:09,644
l hope this train
doesn't spoil my hair.

1952
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:12,050
Rising stars of Dhuliya..

1953
01:40:12,122 --> 01:40:15,683
..the moment you've
been waiting for is here.

1954
01:40:15,726 --> 01:40:20,026
Get ready for over-acting.

1955
01:40:24,902 --> 01:40:27,302
Boss, are you sure the
train will stop here?

1956
01:40:27,571 --> 01:40:29,937
And the police in
there won't shoot at us?

1957
01:40:30,007 --> 01:40:33,841
You'll get to know in
ten minutes. And me too.

1958
01:40:33,911 --> 01:40:35,208
Boss.

1959
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:37,076
Am l or am l not in this film?

1960
01:40:38,749 --> 01:40:41,684
Dear Dambar, it's impossible
to do this scene without you.

1961
01:40:41,752 --> 01:40:44,778
Without you this film will be
like 'Sholay' without Samba.

1962
01:40:44,855 --> 01:40:46,220
Like 'Titanic' without the crack.

1963
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:48,554
The whole world will
remember your name, D'souza.

1964
01:40:48,725 --> 01:40:50,716
Sir, you do remember it. Dhurinder.

1965
01:40:50,761 --> 01:40:52,524
Yes, l will remember it, Dadar.

1966
01:40:52,596 --> 01:40:53,927
Aatish.
- Sir!

1967
01:40:53,997 --> 01:40:55,897
Aatish, the boxes will be heavy.

1968
01:40:55,999 --> 01:41:00,026
But l'd like you to carry them
yourself and load them on the truck.

1969
01:41:00,204 --> 01:41:01,603
Will you be able to do it?

1970
01:41:01,672 --> 01:41:03,003
Of course, sir.

1971
01:41:03,073 --> 01:41:04,904
Besides, l do my own stunts.

1972
01:41:05,876 --> 01:41:07,002
Good luck.

1973
01:41:08,312 --> 01:41:10,075
lf you carry the boxes yourself..

1974
01:41:10,147 --> 01:41:11,910
..then what will
happen to your broken back?

1975
01:41:12,082 --> 01:41:13,674
You got it treated recently, sir.

1976
01:41:13,784 --> 01:41:18,915
Bunty, if l carry the boxes today,
l'll get the Oscar tomorrow.

1977
01:41:22,192 --> 01:41:25,320
Action!

1978
01:41:53,657 --> 01:41:56,182
Sir, many people are
running on the tracks.

1979
01:41:56,260 --> 01:41:57,784
ldiots. What do they want?

1980
01:41:57,861 --> 01:41:59,158
Sir, what do we do?

1981
01:41:59,529 --> 01:42:00,791
Blow the whistle, Jagtap.

1982
01:42:01,565 --> 01:42:03,032
ldiot, the train's whistle.

1983
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:04,692
Blow it. Blow the train's whistle.

1984
01:42:10,173 --> 01:42:11,299
Boss!
- Boss!

1985
01:42:12,776 --> 01:42:14,073
Enough.

1986
01:42:19,683 --> 01:42:20,877
Sir.
- Yes?

1987
01:42:21,018 --> 01:42:22,849
What do we do? Should
we stop or crush them?

1988
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:24,885
There are 200 people.

1989
01:42:24,955 --> 01:42:26,752
lf they die, we'll be imprisoned.

1990
01:42:26,790 --> 01:42:29,850
Move! Go away from the tracks!

1991
01:42:31,862 --> 01:42:33,762
Stop! Stop!

1992
01:42:33,897 --> 01:42:35,888
Hail the motherland!

1993
01:42:39,836 --> 01:42:41,497
He gets the lifetime award.

1994
01:42:53,183 --> 01:42:54,582
Yes!

1995
01:42:55,252 --> 01:42:56,981
Yes!

1996
01:42:57,821 --> 01:42:59,049
Hey move.

1997
01:42:59,690 --> 01:43:02,056
lt's that superstar Aatish Kapoor.

1998
01:43:02,259 --> 01:43:03,783
Sir, let's get his autograph.

1999
01:43:03,827 --> 01:43:05,260
Jagtap, get down!

2000
01:43:05,529 --> 01:43:07,053
Traitors!

2001
01:43:07,230 --> 01:43:11,667
You live off mother lndia,
but you serve the British.

2002
01:43:13,003 --> 01:43:16,530
You dirty dog. Where
is my father's treasure?

2003
01:43:16,606 --> 01:43:18,801
Ma'am, l don't know
who your father is.

2004
01:43:19,810 --> 01:43:20,902
Enough.

2005
01:43:23,981 --> 01:43:26,108
Grab him!
- Move back!

2006
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:32,218
Long live the revolution!

2007
01:43:38,562 --> 01:43:39,893
Hands up!

2008
01:43:40,163 --> 01:43:42,757
Why are you pretending to
shoot with your fake gun?

2009
01:43:42,833 --> 01:43:43,959
Look here. l have a real gun.

2010
01:43:44,735 --> 01:43:46,259
Hit him!

2011
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:51,805
Off with his head.

2012
01:43:51,842 --> 01:43:53,207
Take him away.

2013
01:43:53,643 --> 01:43:57,010
You dirty dog. You traitor!
- Control!

2014
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:58,342
Off with his head.

2015
01:43:59,583 --> 01:44:04,282
People of Dhuliya, loot it!

2016
01:44:04,788 --> 01:44:07,120
l mean pounce on it!

2017
01:44:27,911 --> 01:44:30,004
Hold it properly.
Everything's falling out.

2018
01:44:32,883 --> 01:44:36,717
The more you rob the
bigger the actor you will be.

2019
01:44:36,887 --> 01:44:38,218
Rob it!

2020
01:44:38,288 --> 01:44:40,119
Tabrez, my son.
- Mother?

2021
01:44:40,891 --> 01:44:44,224
Yes, l'm right here.

2022
01:44:44,294 --> 01:44:45,659
Why did you come here?

2023
01:44:45,729 --> 01:44:48,220
''Wherever you go..''

2024
01:44:48,298 --> 01:44:49,890
Quiet! Quiet!

2025
01:44:49,966 --> 01:44:51,194
Who called you here?

2026
01:44:51,268 --> 01:44:53,168
You never invite me to
watch your film shoot.

2027
01:44:53,670 --> 01:44:56,036
So my would-be
daughter-in-law has called me.

2028
01:44:56,106 --> 01:44:57,198
Darn it..

2029
01:44:57,274 --> 01:44:58,707
Her mother has also come.

2030
01:45:00,977 --> 01:45:02,638
lsn't it heavy?
- Yes.

2031
01:45:02,712 --> 01:45:03,906
Let me help you.

2032
01:45:05,282 --> 01:45:06,715
Go away.

2033
01:45:06,750 --> 01:45:08,115
Hey, take this old woman away.

2034
01:45:08,685 --> 01:45:11,654
Mummy, how do l look?

2035
01:45:11,822 --> 01:45:14,120
My baby is looking so beautiful.

2036
01:45:14,191 --> 01:45:16,682
Just like Saira Banu.
- Aren't l?

2037
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:20,924
People of Dhuliya, sing with me.

2038
01:45:20,997 --> 01:45:25,127
''The land of my country..''

2039
01:45:30,774 --> 01:45:32,264
''The land of my country..''

2040
01:45:32,342 --> 01:45:33,707
''Gives us gold..''

2041
01:45:33,777 --> 01:45:35,677
''Gives us diamonds and pearls.''

2042
01:45:35,846 --> 01:45:37,871
''The land of my country.''

2043
01:45:38,148 --> 01:45:40,548
''The land of my country.''

2044
01:45:40,684 --> 01:45:42,174
''The land of my country..''

2045
01:45:42,252 --> 01:45:43,651
''Gives us gold..''

2046
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:45,688
''Gives us diamonds and pearls.''

2047
01:45:45,755 --> 01:45:47,882
''The land of my country.''

2048
01:45:58,168 --> 01:46:02,832
Whatever you're doing is
being captured on our camera.

2049
01:46:02,906 --> 01:46:05,136
So, emotion.

2050
01:46:05,275 --> 01:46:09,109
People of Dhuliya,
sing with enthusiasm.

2051
01:46:09,179 --> 01:46:13,878
''The land of my country..''

2052
01:46:19,322 --> 01:46:20,914
''The land of my country..''

2053
01:46:20,991 --> 01:46:22,219
''Gives us gold..''

2054
01:46:22,292 --> 01:46:24,283
''Gives us diamonds and pearls.''

2055
01:46:24,661 --> 01:46:26,652
''The land of my country.''

2056
01:46:26,963 --> 01:46:28,863
''The land of my country.''

2057
01:46:29,599 --> 01:46:30,998
''The land of my country.''

2058
01:46:31,368 --> 01:46:33,268
Let me call up the commissioner.

2059
01:46:33,803 --> 01:46:35,930
Yes. Yes. Quickly.

2060
01:46:44,047 --> 01:46:46,277
My old friend?

2061
01:46:47,250 --> 01:46:48,877
Yes, Chatterjee.
- Hello, sir.

2062
01:46:49,252 --> 01:46:51,152
We've found Tees Maar Khan.

2063
01:46:52,689 --> 01:46:54,680
He's here in Dhuliya, sir.

2064
01:46:54,758 --> 01:46:56,692
ldiots, that is
'Bharat ka Khazana'.

2065
01:46:56,860 --> 01:46:59,021
Tees Maar Khan is
robbing the treasure.

2066
01:46:59,229 --> 01:47:00,719
And l'm on that same train.

2067
01:47:00,964 --> 01:47:02,090
By the way, where are you?

2068
01:47:02,265 --> 01:47:05,291
Sir, we're somewhere nearby.

2069
01:47:05,669 --> 01:47:07,796
We're watching it
with our own eyes.

2070
01:47:08,838 --> 01:47:12,296
Well done.
ls Tees Maar Khan around?

2071
01:47:12,676 --> 01:47:14,143
ls he speaking on the phone?

2072
01:47:16,346 --> 01:47:20,009
Exactly, sir.
He's speaking on the phone.

2073
01:47:20,083 --> 01:47:21,311
Attack him.

2074
01:47:21,685 --> 01:47:23,312
What? No, sir.

2075
01:47:23,587 --> 01:47:25,612
l said attack him.

2076
01:47:25,689 --> 01:47:26,747
Okay, sir.

2077
01:47:27,657 --> 01:47:30,125
No. No. Blow him away, brother.

2078
01:47:30,193 --> 01:47:33,959
Attack him. Do you have a gun?

2079
01:47:34,297 --> 01:47:37,266
Yes. The latest piece, sir.
Smith & Wesson.

2080
01:47:37,901 --> 01:47:40,597
Excellent! Now remove
all the bullets from it.

2081
01:47:41,671 --> 01:47:42,729
Sir?

2082
01:47:42,772 --> 01:47:44,239
Remove all the bullets.

2083
01:47:44,307 --> 01:47:46,867
Why should l remove the bullets?
l don't understand.

2084
01:47:46,943 --> 01:47:48,774
Had you been that smart..

2085
01:47:48,845 --> 01:47:51,040
..wouldn't you have been
a commissioner like me?

2086
01:47:51,114 --> 01:47:53,275
l want Tees Maar Khan alive.
Understand?

2087
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:54,847
Just do as l tell you to do.

2088
01:47:54,884 --> 01:47:57,944
Throw away the bullets
and arrest Tees Maar Khan.

2089
01:47:58,321 --> 01:47:59,754
Okay, sir.
- Remove them.

2090
01:48:01,558 --> 01:48:02,616
Throw them away.

2091
01:48:04,194 --> 01:48:05,286
Hands up!

2092
01:48:05,895 --> 01:48:08,329
Sir, we've arrested Tees Maar Khan.

Swear on me.

Surprise!

2095
01:48:16,172 --> 01:48:20,802
Saving the honour of a harlot
and imprisoning Tees Maar Khan.

2096
01:48:20,977 --> 01:48:22,342
Both are futile.

2097
01:48:30,153 --> 01:48:31,711
Hurry up. Hurry up!

2098
01:48:31,788 --> 01:48:36,122
Get in. Get in. Old woman,

2099
01:48:37,661 --> 01:48:39,856

Smile! Sing! Aatish, sing. Sing.

2102
01:48:46,636 --> 01:48:47,864
Okay.

Come on, quickly.

01:49:12,796 --> 01:49:14,127
lsn't Aatish coming with us?

2105
01:49:14,164 --> 01:49:15,722
He's gone to get
a suit made for the Oscars.

2106
01:49:16,666 --> 01:49:18,065
Even l wanted a dress.

2107
01:49:18,134 --> 01:49:20,837
l want to watch the film shooting,
Tabrez. - Yes, l'll show you.

2108
01:49:20,837 --> 01:49:21,997
lt's such a beautiful place.
Show me the film shoot.

2109
01:49:22,172 --> 01:49:23,799
Do one thing. Take them both.

2110
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,898
Take them to Mumbai.

2111
01:49:24,974 --> 01:49:26,566
Mother, let's go.

2112
01:49:26,643 --> 01:49:27,871
Stop doing that.

2113
01:49:27,944 --> 01:49:30,071
Gets your legs inside quickly.

2114
01:49:30,246 --> 01:49:32,146
Take them to Mumbai.
Take them away.

2115
01:49:32,882 --> 01:49:34,144
When is the next shot?

2116
01:49:34,217 --> 01:49:35,684
Yes, next year.

2117
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:38,781
Give me the keys to
the trunk. Quickly.

2118
01:49:38,922 --> 01:49:40,787
Why? Do you want to deposit
the treasure in the bank?

2119
01:49:41,124 --> 01:49:42,216
No.

2120
01:49:42,559 --> 01:49:43,992
l had promised myself..

2121
01:49:44,761 --> 01:49:46,854
..that l'd leave some
valuables for the villagers.

2122
01:49:48,264 --> 01:49:50,664
He's large hearted.

2123
01:49:50,734 --> 01:49:51,996
Give me five.

2124
01:49:53,269 --> 01:49:54,998
Are you out of your mind?

2125
01:49:55,305 --> 01:49:56,897
l'm not asking for
your permission. Okay?

2126
01:49:57,107 --> 01:49:58,665
l'm telling you about my decision.

2127
01:49:58,742 --> 01:50:00,642
Besides, we're
giving it from our share.

2128
01:50:00,710 --> 01:50:01,802
You have nothing to do with it.

2129
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:03,278
Come on. Remove the
keys from your pocket.

2130
01:50:04,714 --> 01:50:05,772
Come on.

2131
01:50:06,716 --> 01:50:07,774
Share?

2132
01:50:24,167 --> 01:50:25,725
Come on!

2133
01:50:27,704 --> 01:50:28,898
Move!

2134
01:50:33,143 --> 01:50:35,236
Being an inspector,
you're helping a criminal.

2135
01:50:36,045 --> 01:50:38,775
l'm Commissioner Khadak Singh.

2136
01:50:39,315 --> 01:50:42,910
The one who you've helped
rob 'Bharat ka Khazana'..

2137
01:50:42,986 --> 01:50:46,513
..is the wanted
criminal Tees Maar Khan.

2138
01:50:46,589 --> 01:50:47,817
Yes.
- What?

2139
01:50:48,158 --> 01:50:50,251
Yes. l knew it..

2140
01:50:51,227 --> 01:50:53,252
Sir, how did this happen?
l didn't get it.

2141
01:50:53,530 --> 01:50:54,827
Darn it. Didn't even realise it.

2142
01:50:58,301 --> 01:51:00,269
Tees Maar Khan!

2143
01:51:00,770 --> 01:51:02,032
Quickly. Quickly.

2144
01:51:02,205 --> 01:51:03,297
Listen. Listen.

2145
01:51:03,706 --> 01:51:05,298
Let's put this in the bank.

2146
01:51:05,608 --> 01:51:07,166
You take care of that two-in-one.
- Okay, boss.

2147
01:51:07,243 --> 01:51:08,608
Quickly. Quickly. Go on.

2148
01:51:11,214 --> 01:51:13,011
Boss, looks like he's dead.
Should l check him?

2149
01:51:13,082 --> 01:51:15,050
ls he your uncle?
- No, boss.

2150
01:51:22,959 --> 01:51:24,756
Hello? Tees Maar Khan?

2151
01:51:24,861 --> 01:51:27,159
You need one more box?
Will send it right away.

2152
01:51:27,764 --> 01:51:29,231
Boss has asked for another box.

2153
01:51:29,299 --> 01:51:30,857
Okay. Okay.

2154
01:51:38,808 --> 01:51:41,641
Boss, the Johri brothers
have escaped.

2155
01:51:43,713 --> 01:51:45,738
Stop!

2156
01:51:48,785 --> 01:51:50,514
Why did you let them go?

2157
01:51:50,587 --> 01:51:51,986
They said you asked me to.

2158
01:51:52,055 --> 01:51:53,716
When did l tell him?
- Hands up.

2159
01:51:53,857 --> 01:51:55,017
Let it go.

2160
01:51:55,258 --> 01:51:57,749
Hands up, Tees Maar Khan.

2161
01:52:00,730 --> 01:52:02,095
Speak now.

2162
01:52:06,669 --> 01:52:08,534
This poor guy is still
in character.

2163
01:52:08,605 --> 01:52:09,867
The film shooting is over.

2164
01:52:09,939 --> 01:52:13,534
Your game is up, Tees Maar Khan.

2165
01:52:14,010 --> 01:52:18,242
Look, there's no
enmity between us.

2166
01:52:18,681 --> 01:52:20,046
You're a good actor.

2167
01:52:20,884 --> 01:52:22,875
Come to Mumbai.
l'll introduce you to Yash Chopra.

2168
01:52:23,086 --> 01:52:24,144
He's our uncle.

2169
01:52:24,220 --> 01:52:25,812
Enough film shooting.

2170
01:52:25,989 --> 01:52:27,547
Now surrender
yourself to me quietly.

2171
01:52:27,624 --> 01:52:29,854
Dharindar.. - lt's not Dharindar.
lt's Dhurinder.

2172
01:52:30,126 --> 01:52:32,094
lnspector Dhurinder.

2173
01:52:33,196 --> 01:52:35,926
You're a criminal and
l'm a police officer.

2174
01:52:36,699 --> 01:52:39,190
Address me with respect. Hands up!

2175
01:52:40,637 --> 01:52:44,596
You're under arrest,
Tees Maar Khan.

2176
01:52:45,575 --> 01:52:48,703
Tees Maar Khan,
you're under arrest.

2177
01:52:53,983 --> 01:52:55,712
l'll deal with you back
in Mumbai Doordarshan.

2178
01:52:56,019 --> 01:52:57,111
Order! Order!

2179
01:52:57,887 --> 01:52:59,650
Present the accused in court.

2180
01:53:00,957 --> 01:53:02,151
Stand up.

2181
01:53:02,926 --> 01:53:04,826
All these?
All these are the accused?

2182
01:53:08,665 --> 01:53:11,828
Yes, My Lord. The whole village
is filled with criminals.

2183
01:53:11,901 --> 01:53:13,960
No! No!
- No, Your Honour!

2184
01:53:14,037 --> 01:53:15,766
Order! Order! Silence.

2185
01:53:15,838 --> 01:53:17,635
Speak one by one.

2186
01:53:17,707 --> 01:53:19,607
The whole village carried
out the robbery together.

2187
01:53:19,676 --> 01:53:21,576
They deserve the harshest
of punishments, My Lord.

2188
01:53:21,644 --> 01:53:23,168
No! No!

2189
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:26,080
Quiet. Quiet.

2190
01:53:31,287 --> 01:53:32,584
Who are you, brother?

2191
01:53:32,655 --> 01:53:35,818
lnternational film
director Manoj Day Ramalan.

2192
01:53:35,992 --> 01:53:38,859
l had ordered phony
treasures for my film shoot.

2193
01:53:38,928 --> 01:53:42,557
But sir, some scoundrel
sent genuine treasures.

2194
01:53:42,632 --> 01:53:45,829
And l suspect it is Steven.

2195
01:53:45,902 --> 01:53:47,164
Steven?
- Spielberg.

2196
01:53:47,236 --> 01:53:48,828
He's a liar, Your Honour.

2197
01:53:49,238 --> 01:53:52,036
Firstly, he's
himself a wanted criminal.

2198
01:53:52,709 --> 01:53:55,837
Secondly, he has
been to prison 11 times.

2199
01:53:55,912 --> 01:53:57,812
And he's escaped
from prison 25 times.

2200
01:53:57,880 --> 01:54:00,212
How dare you! l'll
sue you for defamation.

2201
01:54:00,283 --> 01:54:02,615
Get through this case first.
- Sorry, sir.

2202
01:54:02,785 --> 01:54:07,154
To prove his true identity,
l'd like to present two witnesses.

2203
01:54:07,757 --> 01:54:11,659
Special Officers,
Chatterjee and Mukherjee.

2204
01:54:12,595 --> 01:54:13,755
Go ahead.

2205
01:54:14,230 --> 01:54:16,721
Your Honour,
we personally arrested him in Paris.

2206
01:54:16,799 --> 01:54:18,858
But he tricked us and escaped.

2207
01:54:19,102 --> 01:54:21,730
Yes, Your Honour. This is
the international criminal..

2208
01:54:21,804 --> 01:54:25,604
..Tabrez Mirza Khan
alias Tees Maar Khan.

2209
01:54:25,808 --> 01:54:28,368
No. No.

2210
01:54:33,916 --> 01:54:36,316
Your Honour, wait. Wait.

2211
01:54:36,986 --> 01:54:39,887
He's not a criminal. He's a godsend.

2212
01:54:41,858 --> 01:54:47,091
The director left this share of
the treasure at the bank for us.

2213
01:54:47,163 --> 01:54:48,721
For us villagers.

2214
01:54:49,699 --> 01:54:52,827
He's large hearted.

2215
01:54:54,103 --> 01:54:57,971
Your Honour, because of
him l got my son back.

2216
01:54:58,041 --> 01:54:59,565
He can't be a criminal.

2217
01:54:59,642 --> 01:55:00,802
Yes! He can't be.

2218
01:55:00,843 --> 01:55:03,971
lf he's Tees Maar Khan,
then what do we care?

2219
01:55:04,147 --> 01:55:06,672
But he's always thought
about the welfare of the village.

2220
01:55:06,816 --> 01:55:07,942
Yes. Yes. He thought
about our welfare.

2221
01:55:08,017 --> 01:55:11,316
My son might be a criminal,
but he's pure at heart.

2222
01:55:11,587 --> 01:55:12,952
And also cute.

2223
01:55:13,856 --> 01:55:14,982
Silence! Silence!

2224
01:55:15,058 --> 01:55:18,050
Your Honour,
had he been a criminal..

2225
01:55:18,127 --> 01:55:20,652
..he wouldn't have left the
treasure for the villagers.

2226
01:55:20,730 --> 01:55:22,129
You bet.

2227
01:55:22,198 --> 01:55:23,256
Yes. Yes.

2228
01:55:23,332 --> 01:55:26,324
He might've shown me false
dreams about the Oscars..

2229
01:55:26,602 --> 01:55:31,767
..but he has awakened the
artist in me, Your Honour.

2230
01:55:31,874 --> 01:55:34,968
lf he's a criminal, then so am l.

2231
01:55:35,078 --> 01:55:37,069
Punish me as well.
Punish me as well.

2232
01:55:37,146 --> 01:55:38,636
Punish us as well.

2233
01:55:38,715 --> 01:55:39,773
Punish us as well!

2234
01:55:39,849 --> 01:55:41,043
Quiet. Quiet. Silence. Silence.

2235
01:55:41,117 --> 01:55:42,641
Order! Order!

2236
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:44,243
Brother, what now?

2237
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:45,617
What do l know, brother?

2238
01:55:45,755 --> 01:55:47,655
Silence! Quiet! Quiet!

2239
01:55:47,724 --> 01:55:48,884
Punish us as well!

2240
01:55:48,958 --> 01:55:51,984
Did you see that, My Lord?
They're all criminals.

2241
01:55:52,261 --> 01:55:53,626
Punish them.

2242
01:55:53,696 --> 01:55:55,220
l will. l'll surely punish them.

2243
01:55:55,598 --> 01:55:58,066
Quiet! Let me speak.

2244
01:55:58,868 --> 01:56:02,065
On account of all the
evidence and testimonies..

2245
01:56:02,138 --> 01:56:04,299
..this court declares
Tees Maar Khan..

2246
01:56:04,574 --> 01:56:07,702
..and the villagers of
Dhuliya guilty.

2247
01:56:07,777 --> 01:56:11,235
No! No. - What are you saying,
Your Honour?

2248
01:56:11,314 --> 01:56:13,782
What nonsense is this?
- This is not possible.

2249
01:56:15,284 --> 01:56:16,717
Just a minute, Your Honour.

2250
01:56:17,687 --> 01:56:19,018
What now?

2251
01:56:19,088 --> 01:56:20,817
All these people are innocent.

2252
01:56:21,624 --> 01:56:22,921
l'm the only culprit.

2253
01:56:23,826 --> 01:56:27,728
ln fact, l deceived these
decent people and have misled them.

2254
01:56:29,265 --> 01:56:31,859
They didn't even know that a
robbery was about to take place.

2255
01:56:32,368 --> 01:56:33,858
So Your Honour, l request you..

2256
01:56:33,936 --> 01:56:35,870
..that only l should be punished.

2257
01:56:35,938 --> 01:56:38,839
Okay, only you will be punished.

2258
01:56:39,275 --> 01:56:42,267
This court announces 60
years imprisonment for you.

2259
01:56:42,745 --> 01:56:43,939
No!

2260
01:56:44,013 --> 01:56:45,810
No! No, Tabrez.

2261
01:56:45,982 --> 01:56:48,007
Yeah!

2262
01:56:50,853 --> 01:56:53,253
Six years will fly by in a jiffy.

2263
01:56:53,756 --> 01:56:58,056
Not six years, it's 60 years.
60. Case dismissed.

2264
01:57:00,096 --> 01:57:03,224
Not six, but 60 years.

2265
01:57:03,299 --> 01:57:05,631
Counsellor, do something.

2266
01:57:05,701 --> 01:57:07,328
Hit him.

2267
01:57:14,677 --> 01:57:16,770
Boss! Boss, take us with you.

2268
01:57:16,813 --> 01:57:20,874
No. l can't take all of
you with me to prison.

2269
01:57:21,117 --> 01:57:24,644
You have to stay
outside and complete my work.

2270
01:57:25,254 --> 01:57:26,812
You have to fulfil my dream.

2271
01:57:27,323 --> 01:57:28,722
Come on, boss.

2272
01:57:28,791 --> 01:57:31,760
How can we and Anya..
- Rascal!

2273
01:57:31,861 --> 01:57:34,261
Boss, what else is left?
Everything's gone.

2274
01:57:34,330 --> 01:57:35,354
Even the treasure.

2275
01:57:35,665 --> 01:57:36,927
There's one thing left.

2276
01:57:37,900 --> 01:57:38,924
Ma!

2277
01:57:39,001 --> 01:57:41,299
No. Cinema.

2278
01:57:41,904 --> 01:57:43,769
Cinema?
- Yes.

2279
01:57:44,540 --> 01:57:48,271
Have you forgotten our incomplete
film 'Bharat Ka Khazana'?

2280
01:57:48,544 --> 01:57:49,602
Yes.

2281
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:52,807
Listen, l want you to complete that
film and release it. - Okay, boss.

2282
01:57:52,882 --> 01:57:55,578
And whatever profit you make,
give it to the villagers.

2283
01:57:55,718 --> 01:57:57,276
Boss, and you?

2284
01:57:58,955 --> 01:58:00,582
Saving the honour..

2285
01:58:01,924 --> 01:58:05,325
Saving the honour of a harlot
and imprisoning Tees Maar Khan..

2286
01:58:05,795 --> 01:58:07,558
Both are..
- Futile.

2287
01:58:07,630 --> 01:58:09,291
Both are..
- Futile.

2288
01:58:09,565 --> 01:58:11,089
Okay, boys. See you
at the world premiere.

2289
01:58:12,668 --> 01:58:14,067
See you at the premiere.

2290
01:58:14,136 --> 01:58:15,228
Boss!

2291
01:58:28,084 --> 01:58:29,142
Hands up.

2292
01:59:08,224 --> 01:59:10,317
For the first time in
the history of the world..

2293
01:59:10,660 --> 01:59:12,719
..a director is coming
directly from prison..

2294
01:59:12,795 --> 01:59:14,626
..to attend the premiere
of his film.

2295
01:59:14,797 --> 01:59:16,765
Yes, we're talking about..

2296
01:59:16,799 --> 01:59:18,630
..the international
criminal Tees Maar Khan.

2297
01:59:18,801 --> 01:59:20,598
Today, you've got
special permission..

2298
01:59:20,670 --> 01:59:21,796
..to attend the premiere
of your film.

2299
01:59:21,871 --> 01:59:22,997
How do you feel?

2300
01:59:23,072 --> 01:59:24,801
lt feels really great.

2301
01:59:24,941 --> 01:59:27,774
Because two things are
going to be released today.

2302
01:59:27,810 --> 01:59:28,936
Two?

2303
01:59:29,011 --> 01:59:33,107
Yes. My film and me.

2304
01:59:33,716 --> 01:59:35,206
What do you mean?
- lt means..

2305
01:59:35,651 --> 01:59:39,883
The rising sun and
a running Tees Maar Khan..

2306
01:59:39,922 --> 01:59:42,117
..can never fall
into anybody's hands.

2307
01:59:45,594 --> 01:59:47,562
Remember, l'll escape.

2308
02:00:15,791 --> 02:00:17,019
Okay.

2309
02:00:21,030 --> 02:00:22,622
Leave me. Stop it.

2310
02:00:22,698 --> 02:00:24,859
Why are you hitting me?
Who are you? Catch him.

2311
02:00:24,900 --> 02:00:26,868
Catch him. Catch him.
- No.

2312
02:00:32,274 --> 02:00:33,707
Hey!

2313
02:00:37,913 --> 02:00:40,507
You roam naked wearing
handmade cloth.

2314
02:00:41,517 --> 02:00:45,783
How does it feel? My naked
hand on your naked cheek?

2315
02:00:52,895 --> 02:00:55,728
Where is the hard-earned
money of the poor lndians?

2316
02:00:55,965 --> 02:00:57,159
Tell me!

2317
02:00:57,533 --> 02:00:58,693
Let me try.

2318
02:01:00,536 --> 02:01:01,901
You dirty dog!

2319
02:01:01,937 --> 02:01:05,532
Where is the hard-earned
money of the poor lndians?

2320
02:01:05,641 --> 02:01:07,006
Tell me. Tell me. Speak!

2321
02:01:07,043 --> 02:01:09,238
Control. Control.

2322
02:01:14,316 --> 02:01:18,013
''The land of my country..''

2323
02:01:24,293 --> 02:01:25,988
''The land of my country..''

2324
02:01:26,062 --> 02:01:27,188
''Gives us gold..''

2325
02:01:27,329 --> 02:01:29,194
''Gives us diamonds and pearls.''

2326
02:01:29,265 --> 02:01:31,756
''The land of my country.''

2327
02:01:48,918 --> 02:01:50,579
The train's here, Subedar.

2328
02:01:50,653 --> 02:01:51,915
That's me.

2329
02:01:52,988 --> 02:01:55,980
What a film.

2330
02:02:10,940 --> 02:02:12,202
Yes!

2331
02:02:15,578 --> 02:02:17,671
Congratulations!
- To you too.

2332
02:02:17,746 --> 02:02:19,771
You were terrific, my dear!

2333
02:02:20,683 --> 02:02:22,548
Wow. What a piece of art.

2334
02:02:22,685 --> 02:02:25,279
What a film. This is French cinema.

2335
02:02:25,688 --> 02:02:27,679
This film should get an Oscar.

2336
02:02:27,723 --> 02:02:28,815
What is an Oscar?

2337
02:02:28,858 --> 02:02:31,827
Where is the director of the film?
l'd like to fall at his feet.

2338
02:02:36,065 --> 02:02:37,862
Rascal, what have you done?

2339
02:02:38,234 --> 02:02:39,724
Why have you handcuffed me?

2340
02:02:39,768 --> 02:02:41,599
He escaped again. Oh, my God!

2341
02:02:41,670 --> 02:02:44,503
My.. No!

2342
02:02:44,573 --> 02:02:46,234
Sir! Sir!

2343
02:02:46,509 --> 02:02:49,069
Sir! Sir!

2344
02:02:52,047 --> 02:02:56,006
''Money, money. Oh, money.''

2345
02:02:56,218 --> 02:02:58,812
Party-time

2346
02:03:04,894 --> 02:03:06,885
You? How did you get away?

2347
02:03:07,897 --> 02:03:08,989
Like this.

2348
02:03:09,064 --> 02:03:11,055
The cunning criminal
Tees Maar Khan..

2349
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:13,600
..escaped from police
custody for the 26th time.

2350
02:03:13,636 --> 02:03:15,866
And this time from the
premiere of his film.

2351
02:03:19,008 --> 02:03:22,239
l'll give you one chance
to correct your mistake..

2352
02:03:22,311 --> 02:03:25,280
..only if you return my
share of the treasure to me.

2353
02:03:25,581 --> 02:03:27,139
Share? We'll give it
to you right away.

2354
02:03:27,783 --> 02:03:29,011
Guards!

2355
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:31,777
Sir.

2356
02:03:32,555 --> 02:03:33,715
Shoot him.

2357
02:03:37,793 --> 02:03:39,021
What nonsense is this?

2358
02:03:39,295 --> 02:03:41,160
Surprise!

2359
02:03:42,064 --> 02:03:45,591
Hey 'Joint Account'. We're thinking
of taking away your money..

2360
02:03:45,668 --> 02:03:50,162
..and your plane. Right, captain?
- Yes, boss.

2361
02:03:50,272 --> 02:03:51,671
Mind the plane.

2362
02:03:52,641 --> 02:03:54,131
Luckily, l've found one parachute.

2363
02:03:54,276 --> 02:03:55,675
Put it on and both of you jump.

2364
02:03:55,744 --> 02:03:57,268
Go on. Quickly. Quickly.

2365
02:03:57,680 --> 02:03:58,806
He's joking.

2366
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:04,241
Okay. Go on.

2367
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:06,185
Bye-bye.

2368
02:04:06,255 --> 02:04:09,315

2369
02:04:09,592 --> 02:04:10,650

02:04:13,929 --> 02:04:16,921
''Happy ending! Happy ending!''

2372
02:04:16,999 --> 02:04:18,591
Stealing a bone from
a dog's mouth..

2373
02:04:18,667 --> 02:04:20,692
..and money from Tees Maar Khan.

2374
02:04:20,769 --> 02:04:22,361
Both are futile.

2375
02:04:23,105 --> 02:04:24,766
lmpossible.

2376
02:04:29,612 --> 02:04:33,343
And the next category is
the best actor's award..

2377
02:04:35,818 --> 02:04:38,048
