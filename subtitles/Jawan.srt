1
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:41,542
Ma.

2
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,083
Go!

3
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,208
Juju!

4
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,542
- Ma!
- Juju!

5
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,833
- Ma!
- Juju!

6
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:43,583
Ma!

7
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,042
Ma!

8
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,125
Ma!

9
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:14,083
Juju!

10
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,458
O Lord!

11
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:22,625
Disaster has struck our village!

12
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,042
Save us, O Lord!

13
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:30,542
Save us from this calamity, my Lord.

14
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:34,500
If You really exist,

15
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:37,792
You must save us.

16
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:40,583
You must show us that

17
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:44,458
You are not a mere idol.

18
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,333
My Lord!

19
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:27,958
- A messiah!
- A messiah!

20
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,625
Who am I?

21
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,333
When I grow up, I will find out…

22
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:54,667
who you are.

23
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,750
This is my promise.

24
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,000
- Baby?
- No.

25
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Bomb.

26
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Shall we start the show?

27
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Let the musical instruments come.

28
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:48,417
Here you go!

29
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
I'm in.

30
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,042
Isn't it getting late for her exams?

31
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,583
- What's wrong?
- Looks like an accident.

32
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:31,333
My exam's in 20 minutes.

33
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:32,958
Metro.

34
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,167
One ticket for Chakala.

35
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,083
Twenty rupees change, please.

36
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,375
I don't have it.

37
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,333
<i>Next!</i>

38
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:41,583
- But...
<i>- Next!</i>

39
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,375
- Your first metro ride?
- Yeah.

40
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,042
Two for Chakala.

41
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:47,167
- But...
- Come.

42
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,083
Good to go, Chief.

43
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,958
Captain Abhijeet!

44
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:19,292
What's going on?

45
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Boom!

46
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,750
Our greetings to the metro!

47
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:53,125
- What happened?
- Look at this, sir.

48
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:54,875
Hello.

49
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,042
<i>Captain Abhijeet. Captain Abhijeet!</i>

50
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,167
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

51
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:01,958
<i>- Metro train no. 00381…</i>
- Down!

52
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:07,083
<i>From Versova to Ghatkopar
has been hijacked.</i>

53
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,375
Sit!

54
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:13,542
Don't panic.

55
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,833
I'm a police officer.

56
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,250
- Let her go.
- Put your gun down!

57
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,375
Hey!

58
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,167
Gun down or she dies.

59
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:30,537
What are you doing, old man?

60
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:31,833
Sit down.

61
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,208
Are you deaf?

62
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,750
Don't come forward, please!

63
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:36,958
Stop right there.

64
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:39,958
Stop, old man!

65
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:03,708
Old man?

66
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,500
Me? An old man?

67
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,083
You're the old man!

68
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:21,458
My dear passengers,

69
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:24,458
I am your new Captain.

70
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,667
At your service.

71
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,375
But if you try, like this old cop,

72
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,667
to play the hero…

73
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,458
then…

74
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:40,208
God, this cough!

75
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,417
…the villain in me will wake up,

76
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:45,542
and when I become a villain,

77
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:48,083
no hero stands a chance.

78
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,167
Who do you love the most in this world?

79
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,250
My mother.

80
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:53,417
Aw!

81
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,833
So sweet!

82
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,625
Mummy-ji!

83
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,375
How old is your mummy?

84
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,333
Fifty-five.

85
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:05,167
Anyone here his mummy's age?

86
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:07,708
Fifty-five? Fifty-five? Nice.

87
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,583
So many mummys!

88
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:16,833
Imagine, the lady in the burqa
is your mummy!

89
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:18,875
Just imagine!

90
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:24,000
I extend my salaams to you, ladies.

91
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:27,292
Sir!

92
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:31,583
May Allah grant you paradise!

93
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:51,625
Mr. Anil, if you care about
the lives of these 376 people,

94
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:54,667
<i>then bring a man from the system</i>

95
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,000
who has the power to negotiate with me.

96
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:00,000
Someone who is fun to talk to.

97
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:02,833
<i>A woman has been shot
in the Mumbai metro.</i>

98
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:04,833
<i>The video of her merciless killing</i>

99
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:06,625
<i>has gone viral in India.</i>

100
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,333
<i>Force One Chief Narmada Rai</i>

101
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:11,500
<i>has been appointed to negotiate
with the hijackers.</i>

102
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,625
Nice.

103
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,167
<i>Hello, Narmada-ji.</i>

104
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:26,958
What a service!

105
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:29,208
<i>Ten years and seven hostage negotiations</i>

106
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,917
<i>and you've won every time.</i>

107
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,375
You know a lot about me,

108
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,792
tell me something about
your organization.

109
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:35,958
Organization?

110
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,458
Narmada, I work for an organization

111
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:43,458
that's been made a fool of
again and again.

112
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,750
Does it have a name?

113
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,542
"Indian Citizens."

114
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,667
Meaning?

115
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,250
I mean nothing ever changes, madam.

116
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:51,917
Nothing changes.

117
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:56,167
I've given my vote to new people
repeatedly.

118
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,708
I live in hope,

119
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,750
but nothing changes.

120
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,625
Not a damn thing.

121
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,875
So let them all go to hell!

122
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,792
I don't need anyone.

123
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,250
I'll do what needs doing.

124
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,000
And this hijack is the beginning.

125
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,667
All right! Calm down.

126
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,417
<i>Tell me what you want.</i>

127
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,875
I want Alia Bhatt!

128
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,958
But she's too young.

129
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:21,042
- Right?
- Yes.

130
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,125
Yeah.

131
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,667
- Sing me a song.
<i>- What?!</i>

132
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,083
<i>All the shouting has killed my mood.</i>

133
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,708
<i>Go on.</i>

134
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:30,333
<i>Sing "the uneasy song."</i>

135
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,958
A line or two.

136
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,458
Please.

137
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:37,583
<i>Leaving me uneasy</i>

138
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,458
<i>- Don't go away
- Don't go away</i>

139
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:45,500
Narmada, you know, this song is
five minutes and fourteen seconds long.

140
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:47,083
When it's over,

141
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,792
the Agriculture Minister
must be next to you.

142
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,542
I can't get him here in five minutes.
Impossible!

143
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,583
Yeah, he must be busy.

144
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:57,542
<i>But remember, after the song ends,</i>

145
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,417
<i>with every passing minute,
a hostage will be…</i>

146
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,333
<i>Leaving me uneasy</i>

147
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:14,125
<i>Don't go away</i>

148
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,375
<i>For my sake</i>

149
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,000
<i>Come back to me</i>

150
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:20,417
<i>Leaving me uneasy</i>

151
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,125
<i>Don't go away</i>

152
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,417
<i>For my sake</i>

153
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,083
<i>Come back to me</i>

154
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:32,667
Turn it off!
Is this the time to listen to a song?

155
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,042
Sir, we must get there before it ends.

156
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,333
I'm checking the timing.

157
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,958
I'm a Cabinet Minister!

158
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,500
Who asked me to come here?
Was it you?

159
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,458
Sir!

160
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:48,417
It was me.

161
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,792
Why did you call me here?

162
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,875
Sir, you can shout at me all you want,

163
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:55,000
but you can't shout online.
Only 14 seconds to go.

164
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,667
You want me to address
the hijacker as "sir"?

165
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,083
If need be, yes, sir.

166
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:01,250
Say anything that makes him angry,

167
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,958
and he could shoot someone.

168
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:04,167
And if that happens,

169
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:08,542
you may be struggling for votes
at the next elections.

170
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,625
What?

171
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,583
<i>Come back to me</i>

172
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,542
I'm the Agriculture Minister,
Murli Das speaking.

173
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:26,333
<i>Tell me. What can I do for you?</i>

174
00:18:26,542 --> 00:18:28,167
<i>Drop the formality, Minister.</i>

175
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,542
I want to play a fun quiz with you.

176
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:35,958
You have the chance to save them,
if your answers are right.

177
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:39,167
- Agree?
- Well, I'm not a well-read man.

178
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,042
Everything I've learnt,
is thanks to the people.

179
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,875
Don't worry!

180
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,875
The questions concern your department.

181
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,250
Okay, then.

182
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,583
1-0-2-8-1?

183
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:52,708
Okay.

184
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:53,958
What's your question?

185
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,250
That's it, sir.

186
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:59,917
1-0-2-8-1?

187
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,875
Ring a bell?

188
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,625
I'm the Agriculture Minister,

189
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,250
<i>you should talk to the Finance Minister.</i>

190
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,333
<i>Never mind.</i>

191
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,417
In the meantime, play us another song

192
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:10,917
while I get him.

193
00:19:11,042 --> 00:19:12,625
No, stay where you are!

194
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,375
In the past year, under your watch,

195
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,833
10,281 farmers have committed suicide.

196
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:29,083
Ten thousand, two hundred, and eighty-one!

197
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,083
What a pity!

198
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,542
You did not save those farmers,

199
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,750
nor can you save the lives
of these 376 hostages.

200
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:49,583
Sir, please! Give me another chance.

201
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:50,958
Okay. Done.

202
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,625
Say, a farmer wants to buy a tractor.

203
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,458
And a rich guy wants
to buy a Mercedes.

204
00:19:57,542 --> 00:19:58,833
They ask the bank for a loan.

205
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:02,208
Who gets the loan
at a lower rate of interest?

206
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:07,167
Just release all 376 passengers!

207
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,458
<i>The rate of interest for a Mercedes
will be higher</i>

208
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,542
than the rate of interest for a tractor.

209
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:14,958
Wrong, Minister.

210
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:17,833
The rate of interest for a tractor is 13%

211
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,500
and for a Mercedes, it's eight percent.

212
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,125
That's the state of this place.

213
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:28,958
There must be another way
besides quizzing me.

214
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Of course!

215
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:33,083
You have a pen?

216
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,167
No.

217
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,250
Then get one.

218
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,458
<i>Write.</i>

219
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:37,542
Yes?

220
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:41,792
Forty thousand crore,
ninety-seven lakh,

221
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:46,708
thirteen thousand,
five hundred and sixty-six rupees.

222
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:47,875
Only.

223
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:51,667
Sir, if you want a few crore rupees,
I'll talk to the boss.

224
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,917
How can we pay
40,000 crore rupees?

225
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,500
Oh, yeah.

226
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,500
An idea. Ask the private sector,
or a businessman.

227
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:03,875
Sir, we do bail out
businessmen in trouble.

228
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:07,667
But which businessman
will bail us out in return?

229
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:09,208
They will, sir.

230
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:10,875
<i>They will.</i>

231
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,042
You bail out businessmen,
time after time.

232
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,333
Surely, they can do the same for you.

233
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:24,125
In ten minutes, you'll get a call
from a very big businessman.

234
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,625
Make sure you answer it.

235
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:28,708
Alia,

236
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:31,167
you have to make a call for me.

237
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:32,542
Will you?

238
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:45,583
I met Mr. Mukund Menon,

239
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
the District Collector,

240
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,167
a few days ago.

241
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,750
What a personality!

242
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,958
The Ayush Copper Factory
was my dream project.

243
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:00,333
Look, whoever you are…

244
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,167
I'll provide jobs to 57,000 people,

245
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,083
1,00,000 will families benefit.

246
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,583
I'll build schools, colleges, hospitals.

247
00:22:07,917 --> 00:22:09,375
This village will turn into a city.

248
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,000
But your husband doesn't get it.

249
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,667
Now I want you out.

250
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,208
He was young,

251
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:17,665
but had too much attitude.

252
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,125
If I sign,

253
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:23,000
it'll become the most
dangerous place on earth.

254
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,875
If your factory is built there,

255
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:28,917
the air and the water
will become poisonous.

256
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,708
Wasn't one Bhopal disaster enough?

257
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:33,708
My pills.

258
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:38,250
When I get angry, the doctor advised
I have this blue pill.

259
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:42,708
Hey!

260
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:43,833
Give him the red pill.

261
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,875
And this is for anyone
who makes me angry.

262
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Take it.

263
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:52,833
In five minutes,

264
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:54,167
it'll be all over.

265
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:55,667
No, Mukund.

266
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,042
Dissolve it.

267
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,542
Papa is not having it.

268
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:00,625
So you have it.

269
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:07,250
We needed Mr. Menon's signature,
but he refused to sign.

270
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,750
I'd let you go,

271
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,042
but you might file a case against me.

272
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:18,625
Go on.

273
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:19,708
No.

274
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Go on!

275
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,875
Know how this pill works?

276
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,500
Let me explain.

277
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:40,917
You'll feel a thousand needles
pricking every inch of your body.

278
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,875
Your lungs will puff up like balloons.

279
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:45,708
And your breath…

280
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:52,208
If it works the way it should,

281
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:54,750
your ears and nose
will start bleeding.

282
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:00,667
Look!

283
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:01,792
They're bleeding!

284
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,000
You're my daughter now.

285
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:12,125
Your son is like my son.

286
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,750
Until the day I make him
a District Collector,

287
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,833
he'll be Kalee Gaikwad's responsibility.

288
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:20,750
- Sir!
- Yeah?

289
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,559
Your daughter called a few times
when you were on stage.

290
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:23,583
Why didn't you tell me?

291
00:24:35,292 --> 00:24:36,292
Murad!

292
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:40,787
What brings you here, Murad?

293
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:42,708
- Sir wants to talk to you.
- Sir?

294
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:44,208
Yes, sir?

295
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:48,292
Listen.

296
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,417
Kalee's daughter, Alia,
is among the hostages.

297
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Get it, madam?

298
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:53,292
No harm must come to her.

299
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,000
He's ready to pay.

300
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,083
Forty thousand crore?

301
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:57,667
Money means nothing to him.

302
00:24:58,042 --> 00:24:59,667
His daughter does.

303
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,042
Sir, paying such a high ransom
sets a bad precedent.

304
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:07,417
Madam, most things are dependent
on Kalee's favors.

305
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:09,042
Do what you're told.

306
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:10,250
<i>Sir…</i>

307
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:13,500
Ma'am, you want to know how
to transfer the money?

308
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,208
This is Digital India, Narmada-ji!

309
00:25:15,292 --> 00:25:17,458
I've emailed an account number to you.

310
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:20,875
In the next 15 minutes,
if the bank confirms receipt,

311
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:22,625
this train goes to Chakala station.

312
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,000
<i>If not,</i>

313
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:28,333
then all the schools, malls,
and hospitals in a three-kilometer radius,

314
00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:31,417
and every nearby lane will be
destroyed by the blast.

315
00:25:31,542 --> 00:25:34,708
Then I'll haunt you forever.

316
00:25:34,792 --> 00:25:36,792
<i>Leaving you uneasy</i>

317
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:38,583
Your time starts…

318
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,458
now!

319
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:46,208
Sir, the authorization.

320
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:52,292
Transferring, sir.

321
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:56,375
You're a cheat.

322
00:25:57,292 --> 00:25:59,375
You used me to make my dad pay.

323
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:00,833
You're all thieves.

324
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:03,458
- Murderers.
- Right!

325
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:05,083
We're all thieves!

326
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,000
You know why?

327
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:10,375
A loan of 40,000 crore rupees
was waived

328
00:26:10,542 --> 00:26:11,667
by the system overnight.

329
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,167
Your father's loan.

330
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:16,000
And for a measly 40,000,

331
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:21,042
know what the system did to her father?

332
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:23,708
Do you know?

333
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,583
Do you?!

334
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:32,542
Kalki, you'll be late.

335
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,208
Father!

336
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:40,083
Hope you're well prepared
for your exams?

337
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:42,917
Yes, Father. You'll see.
I'll come first in class.

338
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,500
Great!

339
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:46,833
Give that to me.

340
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:50,958
Father, post the application today,
and pay the fees tomorrow.

341
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:52,125
All right.

342
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:00,917
Hey, Kamble!

343
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:03,500
Must I come myself to collect
money from you?

344
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:06,500
Sir, the rains ruined
the harvest this year.

345
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,500
It didn't rain when it was supposed to,

346
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:11,542
and when it did,

347
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:14,375
the heavy downpour ruined my crops.

348
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:17,792
Give me ten days.

349
00:27:18,042 --> 00:27:20,417
- I'll pay you back...
- Hey!

350
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:22,958
Stay away from me.

351
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:28,333
I'll come to the bank
and talk to the manager, sir.

352
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,708
Talk to the manager?

353
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:32,022
What do you think I am?
A lowly clerk?

354
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,833
- A clerk!
- Stop!

355
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:36,875
- A clerk!
- Mom! Stop!

356
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:39,042
- Father!
- Don't hit him.

357
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:44,250
Not in front of my daughter…

358
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:46,667
Don't hit him.

359
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,083
Are you ashamed now?

360
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,833
Father!

361
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:06,875
No!

362
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:09,417
No! Father!

363
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:13,042
Don't hit my father.

364
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,917
- Please!
- Sir. Sir!

365
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,417
- Are you ashamed now?
- Sir!

366
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,542
You can't repay the loan,
but that didn't shame you.

367
00:28:21,792 --> 00:28:23,375
That didn't shame you?!

368
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:26,458
Sir.

369
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:28,000
Take his tractor.

370
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,833
No, sir! Not the tractor.

371
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,268
- He wants to talk to the manager!
- We eat thanks to the tractor.

372
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:34,000
We'll die of hunger.

373
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,625
Pay and take the tractor back.

374
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:36,875
Let's go.

375
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:49,458
Hey!

376
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,583
Quiet! Stop crying.

377
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:52,500
She has exams.

378
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:55,792
Don't cry.

379
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:57,125
It's my fault.

380
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:59,792
I should've repaid the bank.

381
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:01,000
For my sake. Smile.

382
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:07,125
Child, don't worry.

383
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:15,292
<i>It is Your blessings</i>

384
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:19,000
<i>O God!</i>

385
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,667
<i>Are you ashamed now?</i>

386
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,130
TWO LAKH RUPEES GRANTED TO THE FAMILY
OF THE FARMER WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE

387
00:29:57,625 --> 00:30:02,167
<i>It's thanks to You the wind blows</i>

388
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:07,917
- Father!
<i>- You have bestowed many blessings on me</i>

389
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,708
<i>- Show us mercy now</i>
- Father!

390
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:17,250
<i>Show us mercy now</i>

391
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:19,125
Child, don't worry.

392
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:22,750
By the time you come home today,
I'll make sure all is well.

393
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:26,167
<i>O God!</i>

394
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:27,833
Father!

395
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:43,667
When will you repay the loan?

396
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:46,583
My husband's dead body is lying here.

397
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:48,875
Have some shame.

398
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:51,292
You've taken our tractor.

399
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,125
Now what do you want?

400
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,542
The tractor covered the loan.

401
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:58,083
Who'll pay the interest?

402
00:30:58,542 --> 00:31:00,542
My husband is dead.

403
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:03,750
Should I sell myself?
And my daughter?

404
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:11,292
Your husband is dead.

405
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:14,167
So what use is your wedding necklace?

406
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:40,333
This is not the story of one Kalki.

407
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:44,500
From Kashmir to Kanyakumari,

408
00:31:45,292 --> 00:31:47,167
it's the story of farmers.

409
00:31:47,792 --> 00:31:51,625
To repay a small bank loan
of 40,000 rupees,

410
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:55,500
a poor farmer is forced
to commit suicide.

411
00:31:55,917 --> 00:31:56,958
But that same bank,

412
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:02,500
managed to waive your father's loan
of 40,000 crore rupees.

413
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:03,875
Wiped out!

414
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:09,458
But that 40,000 crore rupees…

415
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:12,417
belongs to this country,
to all these people.

416
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:14,792
So we're taking the money back.

417
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,750
Yes, Alia.

418
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:21,333
We're all…

419
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:24,583
big thieves.

420
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,542
When you see your dad, tell him

421
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:32,958
you met a bigger thief than him.

422
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:36,583
And tell him…

423
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:39,417
my name.

424
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,750
Captain, amount received.

425
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,000
Applause!

426
00:32:55,917 --> 00:32:56,917
App...

427
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,542
No applause?

428
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:03,458
Aw! That was a shame, right?

429
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:06,833
My lady!

430
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:10,000
Take a deep breath in.

431
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:13,917
Breathe out slowly.

432
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:19,542
Now I deserve applause.

433
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:41,375
Go, go, go.

434
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:52,375
Cover both entry and exit.

435
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:54,875
Snipers ready, ma'am.

436
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:04,542
Mr. Senior Citizen,
you got what you wanted.

437
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,792
None of your men can escape now.

438
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:09,125
<i>You'll soon be standing
in front of me,</i>

439
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:13,375
then you can sing a song for me.

440
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:17,042
Sure, I will.

441
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:34,750
Guys!

442
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,792
- Hold your fire!
- Copy, ma'am.

443
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:19,917
Ma!

444
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:28,000
They're hostages. Get them all out.

445
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:30,292
Keep them in a safe area
till I get back.

446
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:31,375
Yes, ma'am.

447
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:00,792
Fire!

448
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:14,083
Move!

449
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:23,667
Sorry.

450
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:41,000
<i>Leaving me uneasy Don't go away</i>

451
00:36:46,042 --> 00:36:47,208
<i>Narmada-ji,</i>

452
00:36:47,417 --> 00:36:49,833
<i>shall I sing you another song?</i>

453
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,000
<i>I know lots of songs.</i>

454
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,167
Ma'am, they used the remotely
operated weaponized system.

455
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:57,750
But no one was hit.

456
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,833
Hi-tech distraction!

457
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:16,875
Shridhar, where are the hostages?

458
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:18,250
<i>We must check them all.</i>

459
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:20,875
Their families barged in.
Now we can't tell who is who.

460
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:24,042
There's chaos here.
We had to let them all go.

461
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:26,208
Aarav, did you freeze
the hijacker's account?

462
00:37:26,292 --> 00:37:27,125
We tried, ma'am.

463
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:29,969
The money from that account
was transferred to several other accounts.

464
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,083
So? Freeze them all.

465
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,167
We can't, ma'am.

466
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:34,934
- What do you mean you can't...
- It's not just a few accounts.

467
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:38,333
The money has been transferred
to 7,00,000 accounts.

468
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,125
Who are these 7,00,000 people?

469
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:46,684
Did you also get a text message?

470
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:49,000
Someone has paid back our loan in full!

471
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,208
- Amma.
- What?

472
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:54,042
Our loan has been repaid.
See for yourself!

473
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:58,375
My debt has been cleared.

474
00:37:58,458 --> 00:37:59,458
Father!

475
00:38:05,292 --> 00:38:06,917
- Who did it?
- God!

476
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,833
<i>The loans of 7,00,000 farmers</i>

477
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:28,667
<i>have been repaid by one man.</i>

478
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:32,292
<i>The police have no information about him.</i>

479
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:36,458
<i>But everyone wants to know
who is this Robin Hood?</i>

480
00:38:36,542 --> 00:38:37,542
Sir…

481
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:39,458
Do you have anything to say?

482
00:38:39,542 --> 00:38:42,667
- Brother-in-law, I…
- Narmada.

483
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:48,208
If money was their only motive,

484
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:51,708
they could've kidnapped your daughter
and asked for a ransom.

485
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:53,125
Why this big show?

486
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:55,333
They wanted to make a clear statement.

487
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,750
A very loud statement.

488
00:38:57,833 --> 00:38:58,833
Enough!

489
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:01,792
- She's the one putting on a show.
- Manish!

490
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:08,542
My instinct says
that the hijacker isn't as old

491
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:09,625
as he appears.

492
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:30,083
We have just one clue. Those six girls.

493
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,542
We don't know where they are,
or who they are.

494
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:37,542
I don't believe the game is over.

495
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:41,667
They'll strike again.
Maybe twice as hard.

496
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:45,042
This is just the beginning.
We have a lot to do!

497
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:46,417
Good to go, girls?

498
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:47,684
- Ready, Chief!
- Ready, Chief!

499
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:48,708
Go on.

500
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,071
They're gonna come back stronger,

501
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:00,417
but trust me, sir, I will get them.

502
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,250
I trust you.

503
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,792
Next time I don't want to see them
on the news,

504
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:07,167
- but in jail.
- Sir.

505
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,750
Go, go.

506
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,583
Go, go, go!

507
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:27,583
Janvi, stop!

508
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,625
Why work so hard?

509
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:58,665
It's okay, brother-in-law.

510
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:03,875
You okay?

511
00:41:06,417 --> 00:41:09,250
Papa, the hijacker has sent you a message.

512
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,250
My name…

513
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:14,625
is Vikram Rathore.

514
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,375
Vikram Rathore.

515
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:26,833
Papa.

516
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:28,458
Papa!

517
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:36,875
I've made many documentaries
about jails,

518
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:40,667
but I've never seen or heard
of a jail like this one.

519
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,000
This jail has received

520
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:45,667
the United Nations Public Service
Award this year.

521
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,750
Let's welcome

522
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:51,167
the man who has transformed this prison.

523
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:55,333
Yes! The one and only…
Warden Azad.

524
00:42:14,542 --> 00:42:16,667
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

525
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:20,208
Actually, this jail is 150 years old.

526
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,375
It was a Maharaja's fort once.

527
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,083
The British turned it into a jail.

528
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:28,500
I've been working here
for the past 12 years.

529
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:32,958
I know every inch of this prison,
even better than my own home.

530
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:38,417
I regard every woman inmate here
as a sister or a mother.

531
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:43,750
I believe serving time
is not a punishment.

532
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:46,208
But an opportunity to repent

533
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,833
and to serve society.

534
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:53,583
The women here make prosthetic limbs
for handicapped children.

535
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:07,042
They've made one lakh uniforms
for government schools.

536
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:13,000
They run a modest radio station too.

537
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:16,375
Locked inside these four walls,
every moment

538
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,833
is spent improving the lives
of people on the outside.

539
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:22,875
In the past eight years,

540
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:25,833
not a single woman released from this jail

541
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:28,750
has chosen to return to a life
of crime.

542
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,500
You have given us such a great award,

543
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:35,292
we'd like to thank you.

544
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:37,500
But in our own style.

545
00:43:37,958 --> 00:43:39,042
Good to go, girls?

546
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:41,417
- Good to go, Chief!
- Good to go, Chief!

547
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:46,500
<i>My heart is dancing</i>

548
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:47,583
What?

549
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:54,958
<i>My heart is dancing</i>

550
00:43:55,042 --> 00:44:01,375
<i>Let's dance…</i>

551
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:03,458
<i>Today</i>

552
00:44:03,542 --> 00:44:04,542
Ready?

553
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:18,542
Watch!

554
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:33,917
<i>Be bold when you dance</i>

555
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,792
<i>Shake the ground beneath your feet</i>

556
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:40,250
<i>Dust clouds will float up</i>

557
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:43,333
<i>The sky will bow to the beat</i>

558
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:46,792
<i>A man must be feisty Ever strong</i>

559
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:50,000
<i>Keep thoughts alive
Be a man among men!</i>

560
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:53,167
<i>A man must be feisty Ever strong</i>

561
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:56,542
<i>Keep thoughts alive
Be a man among men!</i>

562
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:59,875
<i>Full of hope Burning heartbeat</i>

563
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:04,208
<i>Heart and soul as pure as the Ganges</i>

564
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:10,250
<i>Heart and soul as pure as the Ganges</i>

565
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:18,958
<i>Dancing bells ring out</i>

566
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,208
<i>Smoke rises beneath your feet</i>

567
00:45:30,042 --> 00:45:31,792
<i>Keep dancing!</i>

568
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:38,125
<i>Keep moving!</i>

569
00:45:41,417 --> 00:45:44,500
<i>Dancing bells ring out</i>

570
00:46:16,417 --> 00:46:19,583
<i>There's no one to match me</i>

571
00:46:19,667 --> 00:46:22,750
<i>We make the world go round</i>

572
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:26,000
<i>Rhythm in our every step</i>

573
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:29,125
<i>Spreading love is our talent</i>

574
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:30,792
<i>Why get tired?</i>

575
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:32,375
<i>Don't just look on</i>

576
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:35,583
<i>Why be shy?
Be a man among men!</i>

577
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:38,750
<i>Be feisty, be strong</i>

578
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:42,208
<i>Keep thoughts alive
Be a man among men!</i>

579
00:46:42,292 --> 00:46:46,750
<i>Come alive Heed the heart</i>

580
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:49,750
<i>Be a man among men!</i>

581
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:55,750
<i>Be a man among men!</i>

582
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:04,583
<i>Dancing bells ring out</i>

583
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:10,750
<i>Smoke rises beneath your feet</i>

584
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,375
<i>Keep dancing!</i>

585
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,792
<i>Keep moving!</i>

586
00:47:27,042 --> 00:47:30,125
<i>Dancing bells ring out</i>

587
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,792
Kaveri, this is your fifth try
this year at matchmaking.

588
00:48:08,292 --> 00:48:09,572
So I'll meet another girl today.

589
00:48:09,792 --> 00:48:12,292
Say hi, say bye a minute later,
and then I'm gone.

590
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,125
Do what you always do,
I'll handle the rest.

591
00:48:16,292 --> 00:48:17,292
Let's go.

592
00:48:23,292 --> 00:48:24,292
The girl didn't show up?

593
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:26,083
This is the girl.

594
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,583
The girl's daughter.

595
00:48:29,792 --> 00:48:32,917
She couldn't come,
so she sent her daughter.

596
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,875
If you two are done,
can our discussion begin?

597
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,500
We'll be spending our lives together,

598
00:48:41,583 --> 00:48:45,958
so it's him and me
who must understand each other.

599
00:48:53,417 --> 00:48:54,917
What's your name?

600
00:48:55,958 --> 00:48:56,958
Suji.

601
00:48:57,083 --> 00:48:59,875
And you're looking for a husband
for your mummy?

602
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:02,125
Well?

603
00:49:02,292 --> 00:49:03,833
I'm looking for a Papa.

604
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:10,875
And what can a Papa do that a Mummy can't?

605
00:49:11,042 --> 00:49:12,792
Lots of things.

606
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:14,792
- Like?
- Like…

607
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:16,542
I'm weak at math.

608
00:49:16,708 --> 00:49:19,208
That's why my teacher whacks me.

609
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:22,042
So you need a Papa to teach you math?

610
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:27,125
I need a Papa to whack my teacher.

611
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:28,958
To whack your teacher?

612
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,250
Done.

613
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:35,417
- What else?
- I love horror movies.

614
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,458
But they scare me.

615
00:49:37,542 --> 00:49:42,167
If I could hold Papa's hand tightly,
I could watch the whole movie.

616
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:46,083
And I'd like to ride on Papa's motorbike,
full speed.

617
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:48,375
Mummy has taught me everything.

618
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:50,417
But she's a bit strict.

619
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:54,917
I want a Papa who'll spoil me.
Are you getting me, buddy?

620
00:49:58,583 --> 00:50:01,542
You've gone all senti!
May I ask you something?

621
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:03,833
Go on.

622
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:07,417
Is your hair this color?
Or is it dyed?

623
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,417
A hundred percent original!

624
00:50:11,167 --> 00:50:13,500
Okay, sometimes I dye it.

625
00:50:13,583 --> 00:50:16,208
I see. Do you exercise?

626
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:18,667
Push-ups on two fingers.

627
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:19,750
Show me!

628
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:26,625
Look!

629
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:30,375
- Yeah?
- Will you look after my mummy?

630
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:31,458
Of course.

631
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:38,417
- Now stop. Save your number for me.
- Thank you.

632
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,708
You can give me a missed call.

633
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,542
Why? I'll call when I want to talk to you.

634
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:47,917
Shall we take a selfie?

635
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:50,792
- For Mummy's approval.
- Okay.

636
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:53,125
- Pout.
- Pout?

637
00:50:58,833 --> 00:51:00,458
Irani, anything?

638
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
No, ma'am.

639
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:03,333
Nothing solid.

640
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:06,348
There were so many people in that metro.
And no one knows anything?

641
00:51:06,417 --> 00:51:09,417
They're all his fans, ma'am.
There's no point questioning them.

642
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:11,417
What about the cop?

643
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,042
No idea where he disappeared, ma'am.

644
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:16,250
He didn't report back.

645
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:26,833
- Hey, buddy!
- Where are you, buddy?

646
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,042
- I'm in jail.
- Me too.

647
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:29,958
In jail?

648
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:31,333
Holy Cross Convent.

649
00:51:32,333 --> 00:51:36,083
- Listen… in one subject…
- You failed?

650
00:51:36,167 --> 00:51:38,792
- No! I passed in one subject.
- Just one?

651
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:42,917
The principal is torturing me.
She wants to meet my parents.

652
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,500
Anyways, I've already given you
Papa's role,

653
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:49,000
<i>so can you play the part from tomorrow.</i>

654
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:51,667
Saturday, two o'clock. Don't be late.

655
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Mama!

656
00:52:11,542 --> 00:52:13,083
- Suji.
- Mama!

657
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:14,601
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes.

658
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:16,042
- Narmada. Head of Force One.
- No.

659
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:18,707
I'm the warden at Belamvada
Women's Jail, madam sir.

660
00:52:18,917 --> 00:52:20,083
What are you doing?

661
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:23,292
- Put your hand down.
- Yeah.

662
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:25,625
- Mama, it's him.
- Who?

663
00:52:25,708 --> 00:52:27,042
The man you were looking for…

664
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:28,750
to marry.

665
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:32,625
Suji, this is not cool.

666
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:33,958
But he's so cool.

667
00:52:34,042 --> 00:52:35,500
I… I'm very hot.

668
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:37,958
Don't mess it up, buddy!

669
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:40,083
Suji, come here.

670
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:44,833
Thank you, Narmada-ji.

671
00:52:45,917 --> 00:52:47,958
I did my masters in Boston.

672
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,542
I was in a relationship.

673
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,958
One day I found out I was pregnant.

674
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:55,250
He said he'd only talk to his parents

675
00:52:56,417 --> 00:52:57,750
if I had an abortion.

676
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:02,167
Instead of getting married,

677
00:53:03,667 --> 00:53:04,667
I chose Suji.

678
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:08,500
As a mother, I wanted to give
Suji everything.

679
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:10,125
But a father…

680
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:13,583
isn't just a relationship.

681
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:17,417
He must be trusted totally, you know?

682
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:18,917
He must make you believe

683
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,458
that even if the world turned against you,
he'd fight for you.

684
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:27,875
When Suji looks at you,
I see that trust in her eyes.

685
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,708
I broke my relationship…

686
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:33,500
because of Suji.

687
00:53:35,375 --> 00:53:37,292
If I have another relationship,

688
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,120
it'll be because of her too.

689
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:42,333
Never break her trust in you.

690
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:44,125
So,

691
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:46,333
whatever you decide,

692
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:48,125
think about it carefully.

693
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:52,875
I'm just like Suji.

694
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:55,125
I never knew my father.

695
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:59,500
I haven't experienced the trust
you're talking about.

696
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:02,735
My mother died when I was a child.

697
00:54:03,292 --> 00:54:05,792
That's why Kaveri-ji raised me.

698
00:54:07,542 --> 00:54:11,958
You've told me so much about you and Suji,

699
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:17,458
I'd like to tell you something
about my life.

700
00:54:18,917 --> 00:54:19,917
Like what?

701
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:21,375
What work I do.

702
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:23,792
Why I do it.

703
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:26,500
How I do it. And…

704
00:54:27,542 --> 00:54:30,792
- Everything…
- Papa, Daddy, Pops.

705
00:54:30,875 --> 00:54:32,417
I was wondering,

706
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:35,625
if Mama accepts you,
what should I call you?

707
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:44,292
Mama, you like him?

708
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:47,417
And you?

709
00:54:57,875 --> 00:55:00,000
<i>Love makes a heart</i>

710
00:55:00,417 --> 00:55:02,458
<i>Love breaks a heart</i>

711
00:55:07,958 --> 00:55:10,042
<i>Erase me or embrace me</i>

712
00:55:10,458 --> 00:55:12,500
<i>I have chosen you</i>

713
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:20,083
<i>Dyed in your myriad of colors</i>

714
00:55:20,167 --> 00:55:22,625
<i>I belong to you now</i>

715
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:30,208
<i>Love cannot be measured or hidden</i>

716
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:32,667
<i>I've left the world for you</i>

717
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:42,792
<i>I'm coming to you when I hear you call</i>

718
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:45,042
<i>Lost in you</i>

719
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,583
<i>The world is lost to me</i>

720
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:52,875
<i>I'm coming to you when I hear you call</i>

721
00:55:52,958 --> 00:55:55,208
<i>Lost in you</i>

722
00:55:55,458 --> 00:55:57,833
<i>The world is lost to me</i>

723
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,333
<i>I've left the world for you</i>

724
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:03,958
<i>We're one now</i>

725
00:56:04,667 --> 00:56:06,500
<i>I am all yours</i>

726
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:09,000
<i>Lost in you</i>

727
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,583
<i>I've left the world for you</i>

728
00:56:12,167 --> 00:56:14,625
<i>We're one now</i>

729
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:17,125
<i>I am all yours</i>

730
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:19,917
<i>Lost in you</i>

731
00:56:21,208 --> 00:56:23,375
<i>Love makes a heart</i>

732
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,875
<i>Love breaks a heart</i>

733
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:33,333
<i>Make me laugh or cry</i>

734
00:56:33,792 --> 00:56:35,917
<i>I have chosen you</i>

735
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:43,458
<i>The world says love's a lie</i>

736
00:56:43,542 --> 00:56:46,042
<i>But it's a lie
That I whole-heartedly accept</i>

737
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:53,500
<i>I see the Lord's grace in you</i>

738
00:56:53,583 --> 00:56:56,083
<i>I'm proud to call you mine</i>

739
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:06,042
<i>I'm coming to you when I hear you call</i>

740
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:08,583
<i>Lost in you</i>

741
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:11,083
<i>The world is lost to me</i>

742
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:16,292
<i>I'm coming to you when I hear you call</i>

743
00:57:16,375 --> 00:57:18,667
<i>Lost in you</i>

744
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,667
<i>The world is lost to me</i>

745
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:23,208
<i>You're a lovely dream</i>

746
00:57:23,292 --> 00:57:25,708
<i>A dream that knows no bounds</i>

747
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:28,250
<i>I'm in love with your words</i>

748
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:30,750
<i>Elegant as an Urdu book</i>

749
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:33,250
<i>You're a lovely dream</i>

750
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:35,708
<i>A dream that knows no bounds</i>

751
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:38,333
<i>I'm in love with your words</i>

752
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:40,583
<i>Elegant as an Urdu book</i>

753
00:57:40,667 --> 00:57:42,250
<i>I've left the world for you</i>

754
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,542
<i>- Love makes the heart
- We're one now</i>

755
00:57:44,625 --> 00:57:47,542
<i>- Love breaks the heart
- I'm all yours</i>

756
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,917
<i>Lost in you</i>

757
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,292
<i>Brothers and sisters,</i>

758
00:57:56,375 --> 00:57:59,750
from the day I was appointed
the Health Minister,

759
00:57:59,958 --> 00:58:06,458
I made sure all the government
hospitals are world-class.

760
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,208
We now have modern beds!

761
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:15,167
The latest medical equipment!
All thanks to me!

762
00:58:17,792 --> 00:58:20,333
World-class operating theaters!

763
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:21,792
Faster!

764
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:24,625
The hospitals are fully equipped.

765
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:28,958
If someone shot me right now,

766
00:58:29,042 --> 00:58:34,083
no need for a private hospital.

767
00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:38,917
The government hospital nearby
can easily save me.

768
00:58:40,208 --> 00:58:44,875
If you don't believe,
aim straight at my heart.

769
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:47,667
Shoot!

770
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:49,417
Shoot me!

771
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,500
Shoot!

772
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:54,125
Ambulance!

773
00:58:56,583 --> 00:58:57,583
Move!

774
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,833
Move! Clear the road.

775
00:59:07,917 --> 00:59:08,917
Get an ambulance!

776
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,958
Why do you need two ambulances?

777
00:59:11,167 --> 00:59:12,167
Move!

778
00:59:13,042 --> 00:59:14,333
We'll be there in ten minutes.

779
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:17,417
Tell the doctors to get
the operating theater ready.

780
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:18,625
Go, go, go. Go fast!

781
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:19,708
Move!

782
00:59:29,042 --> 00:59:30,917
Where's the Minister?

783
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:33,958
HARIPUR
1 KM

784
00:59:34,042 --> 00:59:35,250
Where are we going?

785
00:59:36,458 --> 00:59:38,167
Who are you? What's going on?

786
00:59:39,583 --> 00:59:42,083
Sister, where are you taking the Minister?

787
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:44,847
To a world-class hospital.
Like the ones he was praising to the sky.

788
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:46,750
He was lying!

789
00:59:52,208 --> 00:59:53,417
GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL
HARIPUR

790
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:56,750
Stretcher!

791
00:59:57,083 --> 00:59:58,083
Str...

792
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:59,792
- What is this?
- Wheelchair.

793
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:01,375
Come on! Hurry!

794
01:00:01,458 --> 01:00:03,667
Hurry! He's hurt!

795
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:05,000
You call this dump a hospital?!

796
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:06,208
Was this hit by a Tsunami?!

797
01:00:06,292 --> 01:00:07,292
Doctor!

798
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:08,333
- Hey...
- Move!

799
01:00:08,417 --> 01:00:09,917
- But the operation...
- Move!

800
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,125
- The Minister's been shot...
- Stay here.

801
01:00:15,292 --> 01:00:17,812
What's wrong with you?
Get a few more doctors for the operation!

802
01:00:18,042 --> 01:00:20,667
He's already been shot!
What's the point of this security now?!

803
01:00:21,667 --> 01:00:23,625
The Minister's been kidnapped.

804
01:00:23,917 --> 01:00:25,583
Kidnapped the Minister?

805
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:28,333
The Minister?

806
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:29,917
I'm glad you understood.

807
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:32,000
Zip your mouth…

808
01:00:32,292 --> 01:00:34,125
or I'll put a bullet in it.

809
01:01:01,208 --> 01:01:02,208
Who are you?

810
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:07,792
Let's roll.

811
01:01:08,292 --> 01:01:09,708
- I'm set.
- Good to go, Chief.

812
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:12,208
<i>Namaskaar. Aadab. Sat Sri Akaal.</i>

813
01:01:12,292 --> 01:01:13,833
I am Vikram Rathore.

814
01:01:13,917 --> 01:01:17,417
We've kidnapped the Health Minister
in broad daylight!

815
01:01:17,667 --> 01:01:20,917
Can a government hospital
save the Minister's life,

816
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:22,708
or not?

817
01:01:23,708 --> 01:01:24,958
<i>Let's start the show!</i>

818
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:32,292
The Health Minister's condition
is critical.

819
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:34,500
<i>To save his life,</i>

820
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:37,042
<i>we must operate at once.</i>

821
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:40,458
<i>But we don't have
the right equipment.</i>

822
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:44,208
Ask me what you want.
I'll talk to the system. Ask!

823
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:48,458
A general surgeon, no,
a cardio-surgeon is better.

824
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:51,542
A senior anesthetist,
theater staff,

825
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:55,125
ventilator support, masks, gloves.
We need everything.

826
01:01:55,542 --> 01:01:57,083
And some cotton wool.

827
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:59,458
Is the board that says "hospital"
all you have?

828
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:05,667
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am!

829
01:02:06,292 --> 01:02:07,542
<i>Hello, Narmada-ji.</i>

830
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:09,875
I've missed you.

831
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:11,167
How much this time?

832
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:15,625
I just want the truth
and nothing but the truth.

833
01:02:15,708 --> 01:02:16,708
I don't get it.

834
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:18,583
Three years to the day,

835
01:02:18,667 --> 01:02:24,208
in this very hospital,
the truth was replaced by false claims.

836
01:02:24,917 --> 01:02:27,875
Mr. K George is the current
Health Secretary.

837
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:30,167
He used to head this hospital.

838
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:33,083
<i>Tell him to admit the truth on TV.</i>

839
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,917
And if he sugar-coats it,

840
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:40,792
then start threading a flower garland

841
01:02:41,167 --> 01:02:42,542
for your dying Minister.

842
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:45,500
Shit!

843
01:02:46,667 --> 01:02:47,958
- Sir will talk to you.
- Sir?

844
01:02:48,042 --> 01:02:49,583
George, tell them the truth.

845
01:02:49,667 --> 01:02:51,625
If I do, I'll lose my job.

846
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:54,083
- If you don't, you'll lose your life.
- It's not just me.

847
01:02:54,167 --> 01:02:57,125
Many are involved,
including the Health Minister.

848
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,500
He's my brother-in-law.

849
01:02:58,833 --> 01:03:00,667
I'll look after him.
Tell them the truth.

850
01:03:00,917 --> 01:03:01,792
Okay, sir.

851
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:03,708
<i>The hospital hijacking
has taken a new turn.</i>

852
01:03:03,792 --> 01:03:05,601
<i>The Health Secretary has called
a press conference.</i>

853
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:08,208
I am K George, the Health Secretary.

854
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:11,792
<i>Three years ago, on 27th February,</i>

855
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:17,083
<i>sixty children were admitted
into this hospital with encephalitis.</i>

856
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:25,750
Doctor, this is the last cylinder.

857
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,375
Breathe!

858
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:38,625
That's right. Good.

859
01:03:38,958 --> 01:03:42,042
Our stock of oxygen cylinders
will soon be over.

860
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:43,958
- Tell the Dean now.
- Doctor, one minute.

861
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,417
- Yes?
- Sir, they said the cylinders

862
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,917
would arrive this evening,

863
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,167
<i>but nothing has come.</i>

864
01:03:52,792 --> 01:03:55,917
It's an emergency, sir.
Sixty children's lives are at stake.

865
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:59,458
There are many formalities
in these matters.

866
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:02,125
Let them be completed,
then you'll get the cylinders.

867
01:04:02,208 --> 01:04:05,792
If you don't take immediate action,
I'll complain to your superiors.

868
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,667
<i>I'll take it to the Health Minister.</i>

869
01:04:08,125 --> 01:04:09,292
Health Minister?

870
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,250
From cotton wool to cardiology equipment,

871
01:04:13,417 --> 01:04:15,708
all hospital supplies are only sanctioned

872
01:04:15,792 --> 01:04:18,750
when the Health Minister,
the Director of Medical Services,

873
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:20,393
the Purchase Department,
the Tender Committee,

874
01:04:20,417 --> 01:04:21,708
and Deans like me

875
01:04:21,792 --> 01:04:23,542
have our commission percentage fixed.

876
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:27,875
Without that, even a small phenyl bottle
does not enter a hospital.

877
01:04:28,042 --> 01:04:31,250
Go, see the top man!
He enjoys the biggest commission.

878
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:32,500
<i>Go as high as you want.</i>

879
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,792
Come, hurry!

880
01:04:42,917 --> 01:04:47,083
Calm down. Now pay attention.
These are Ambu bags.

881
01:04:47,542 --> 01:04:50,542
They are used when there are
no oxygen cylinders.

882
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:54,417
Cover the children's mouths,
press down in rhythm.

883
01:04:54,542 --> 01:04:56,667
If we don't use these bags
till we get the cylinders,

884
01:04:57,083 --> 01:04:58,667
the children may die.

885
01:04:59,292 --> 01:05:00,958
Come on, hurry!

886
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:02,750
Guru, please take charge.

887
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:05,458
- I'll get the cylinders now.
- I'm on it.

888
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,292
<i>Every breath is a gamble</i>

889
01:05:40,625 --> 01:05:46,250
<i>Innocents robbed of their lives
By greed</i>

890
01:05:46,625 --> 01:05:49,542
<i>God's sky has split apart</i>

891
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:55,333
<i>Fly away, little birds</i>

892
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:01,250
- <i>This world is unworthy of you</i>
- Guru!

893
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:06,750
<i>Fly away, little birds</i>

894
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:14,833
<i>Your swing burns like a funeral pyre</i>

895
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:20,667
<i>Your protectors sentence you to death</i>

896
01:06:21,417 --> 01:06:24,708
<i>God's sky is split apart</i>

897
01:06:24,917 --> 01:06:26,750
<i>Fly away, little birds</i>

898
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:30,833
The pediatrician on duty,
Dr. Eeram, was high on drugs.

899
01:06:31,042 --> 01:06:34,250
Her blood test has proved it.

900
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:38,458
She was high on drugs.
Due to Dr. Eeram's negligence

901
01:06:38,583 --> 01:06:40,417
57 children died.

902
01:06:40,958 --> 01:06:43,042
It was not because of a shortage
of oxygen.

903
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:49,042
<i>Hence the court gives a double life
sentence to Dr. Eeram.</i>

904
01:06:49,417 --> 01:06:52,042
<i>It also advises the Medical Council</i>

905
01:06:52,417 --> 01:06:57,000
<i>to suspend her medical license
for two years with immediate effect.</i>

906
01:06:57,792 --> 01:06:59,958
I didn't cause their death.

907
01:07:01,292 --> 01:07:04,083
This Dr. Eeram…

908
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:08,875
is a terrible stain on our medical system.

909
01:07:09,208 --> 01:07:13,667
<i>The true responsibility
for the death of the children</i>

910
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:16,875
<i>lies with me and the hospital management</i>

911
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:18,792
<i>and not with Dr. Eeram.</i>

912
01:07:22,792 --> 01:07:24,583
There! Put that pillow on his face!

913
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,917
And choke him to death.

914
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:31,375
I won't tell a soul. I promise.

915
01:07:32,208 --> 01:07:34,917
<i>Whenever this happens
in some department,</i>

916
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:38,292
it's covered up as a scam
and hidden away.

917
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:41,750
But when this happens
in the medical world,

918
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:43,083
it isn't called a scam,

919
01:07:43,833 --> 01:07:44,833
it's called…

920
01:07:46,542 --> 01:07:47,542
murder.

921
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,417
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

922
01:07:53,875 --> 01:07:58,000
I've emailed you a list
of 234 government hospitals.

923
01:07:58,375 --> 01:07:59,833
- Done.
- Yes, ma'am.

924
01:07:59,958 --> 01:08:03,917
<i>Make sure they have
their supplies in five hours.</i>

925
01:08:04,292 --> 01:08:06,292
They must lack nothing.

926
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,208
There isn't time to get it done.

927
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:11,542
The Minister had ten years to do it.

928
01:08:11,667 --> 01:08:14,125
I'm giving you five extra hours.

929
01:08:14,542 --> 01:08:17,333
So today, time is life,

930
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:18,833
or death.

931
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:22,458
Tick-tock… tick-tock.

932
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:26,708
<i>Our healthcare has been neglected…</i>

933
01:08:26,792 --> 01:08:29,417
<i>Vikram Rathore
has given five hours to fix this system.</i>

934
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:35,708
<i>We've waited years for our
healthcare to improve.</i>

935
01:08:36,208 --> 01:08:39,625
<i>Vikram Rathore has given the system</i>

936
01:08:39,708 --> 01:08:41,375
<i>five hours to fix things.</i>

937
01:08:41,708 --> 01:08:43,750
<i>We can see that it can be done.</i>

938
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:46,125
<i>A job that takes ten years
can be done in five hours.</i>

939
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:58,875
<i>Now there's only one name
on everyone's lips.</i>

940
01:08:59,042 --> 01:09:00,417
<i>Vikram Rathore!</i>

941
01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:20,500
<i>We're witnessing
that five hours are enough</i>

942
01:09:20,583 --> 01:09:23,125
<i>to do what can usually take
ten to twenty years.</i>

943
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:26,833
<i>The only thing required is
the intent of the system.</i>

944
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:30,375
<i>Your demands have been met.</i>

945
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:32,292
<i>Hospitals will not lack supplies now.</i>

946
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:33,875
Or in the future.

947
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:36,875
That's good! Another request for you.

948
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:38,333
What do you want now?

949
01:09:38,458 --> 01:09:39,819
After pulling off such a big scam,

950
01:09:40,583 --> 01:09:42,208
I can hardly call for an Uber.

951
01:09:42,583 --> 01:09:45,042
Isn't a chopper more fitting?
What do you say?

952
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:00,917
Girls, watch your six!

953
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Where is he?

954
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:30,875
Where is he?

955
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:35,792
Ma'am!

956
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:38,042
Good to go, Chief!

957
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:55,083
Ready?

958
01:12:51,875 --> 01:12:52,875
Down! Down!

959
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:06,125
Let's go, Chief. Let's go.

960
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:37,042
Ma'am, I have the DNA
results from his hair.

961
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:38,583
They don't belong to one man.

962
01:13:38,792 --> 01:13:41,875
They belong to many people
of different age groups.

963
01:13:42,417 --> 01:13:44,083
- So he wears a wig?
- Yes, ma'am.

964
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:47,542
Call the best forensic artist
in the department.

965
01:13:47,958 --> 01:13:50,625
Use Vikram Rathore's image
as reference and make sketches

966
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:53,042
of him at 25, 35, 45.

967
01:13:53,583 --> 01:13:55,875
I want to see him at different ages.

968
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Yes, ma'am.

969
01:13:57,792 --> 01:14:00,000
- See you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow's your wedding, ma'am.

970
01:14:00,458 --> 01:14:02,875
Yes. If there's anything important,

971
01:14:03,042 --> 01:14:04,208
don't hesitate to contact me.

972
01:14:04,292 --> 01:14:06,500
- Is that an order, ma'am?
- Yes, it is.

973
01:14:07,458 --> 01:14:08,458
Namaste.

974
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:10,205
Why were those people here?

975
01:14:11,333 --> 01:14:12,583
Why did you call them here?

976
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,083
The elections are in two months.

977
01:14:15,792 --> 01:14:19,083
Even if you pay them,
they'll do as they please.

978
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:22,917
They won't listen to us
because they hold the power.

979
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:26,583
We need that power in our hands.

980
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,667
You're joining a political party?

981
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,333
Guru-ji, that's it for today.

982
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:40,708
There was once a king like you.

983
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:43,875
He lost battle after battle.

984
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:46,250
So he roamed about hungry
and thirsty,

985
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:47,875
full of rage.

986
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:52,792
One day an old lady gave him rice
and hot dal.

987
01:14:53,792 --> 01:14:57,292
He dipped his fingers into the bowl
with the hot dal.

988
01:14:58,083 --> 01:14:59,292
He burnt his fingers.

989
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:03,958
The old woman told him,

990
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:07,583
"Eat slowly from the bowl's edge,
then you'll enjoy it."

991
01:15:08,375 --> 01:15:13,542
A few days later the king
won back his kingdom.

992
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:20,833
Look after things
till I return from Russia,

993
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:22,625
Keep a cool head.

994
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:25,875
When the time is right,

995
01:15:27,667 --> 01:15:29,167
we'll fix them all.

996
01:15:30,875 --> 01:15:31,875
My sweet brother!

997
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:49,417
<i>Lord Krishna, come to me</i>

998
01:15:50,458 --> 01:15:54,083
<i>Come to me</i>

999
01:16:03,375 --> 01:16:07,417
<i>Leafing through the beautiful pages
Of a Tamil dictionary</i>

1000
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:12,000
<i>I came across the beautiful name
Krishna</i>

1001
01:16:12,083 --> 01:16:16,333
<i>It's time for you to come close to me</i>

1002
01:16:16,417 --> 01:16:20,708
<i>I will welcome you home
With a lovely rangoli</i>

1003
01:16:20,792 --> 01:16:25,042
<i>I will watch you</i>

1004
01:16:25,125 --> 01:16:29,208
<i>As you swing in the cradle</i>

1005
01:16:29,292 --> 01:16:33,708
<i>When your lips break into a smile</i>

1006
01:16:33,792 --> 01:16:37,958
<i>That smile is enough for me</i>

1007
01:16:38,042 --> 01:16:41,333
<i>Krishna is around us</i>

1008
01:16:42,333 --> 01:16:46,708
<i>Looking so innocent</i>

1009
01:16:46,792 --> 01:16:53,792
<i>Krishna, come into the courtyard softly…</i>

1010
01:16:55,417 --> 01:16:59,417
<i>Softly…</i>

1011
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:06,458
<i>Come into the courtyard softly, Krishna…</i>

1012
01:17:07,667 --> 01:17:08,667
What are you thinking?

1013
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:11,292
Narmada, I want to tell you something.

1014
01:17:11,792 --> 01:17:13,875
I've thought about it,
even tried to tell you.

1015
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:16,042
Why the suspense?

1016
01:17:16,375 --> 01:17:17,500
Just tell me what it is.

1017
01:17:21,167 --> 01:17:23,167
I was thinking as we were alone
for the first time,

1018
01:17:23,542 --> 01:17:25,500
you'd say something romantic
to impress me.

1019
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,500
But you're so serious.

1020
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:30,042
Always so serious?

1021
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:41,292
Answer it.
I'll be right back.

1022
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,375
Janvi, I've told you
to never call me from jail!

1023
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:47,833
Why are you angry, Chief?

1024
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:56,167
You're on the most important
mission of your life,

1025
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:58,958
so you might need our technical support!

1026
01:18:02,375 --> 01:18:04,292
<i>Ma'am, I've been trying
to contact you.</i>

1027
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:06,184
<i>I've sent you the photos on WhatsApp.
Please check.</i>

1028
01:18:06,208 --> 01:18:08,250
<i>Be careful.</i>

1029
01:18:10,667 --> 01:18:13,917
- I'm going to tell Narmada everything.
<i>- What's wrong?</i>

1030
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,500
No, no, Chief.

1031
01:18:17,542 --> 01:18:19,625
I've decided to tell her every...

1032
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:21,333
Chief! Chief!

1033
01:18:22,208 --> 01:18:23,208
<i>Chief?</i>

1034
01:18:23,792 --> 01:18:24,708
Why?

1035
01:18:24,792 --> 01:18:27,000
- Narmada, I was about to tell you.
<i>- Chief?</i>

1036
01:18:27,458 --> 01:18:30,708
Suji did nothing to harm you.
Why deceive her?

1037
01:18:31,125 --> 01:18:33,167
I never wanted to deceive you, or her.

1038
01:18:34,458 --> 01:18:37,125
One more step and I will shoot you.

1039
01:18:37,792 --> 01:18:38,833
Suji is my daughter too.

1040
01:18:39,167 --> 01:18:40,958
Suji is not negotiable.

1041
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:45,125
- Let's go!
- Open the cell!

1042
01:18:46,375 --> 01:18:47,375
Go, go.

1043
01:18:47,667 --> 01:18:50,042
You've got it wrong.
Listen to me.

1044
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:56,208
Narmada!

1045
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:09,250
- Helana, did you find the location?
- On it.

1046
01:19:09,333 --> 01:19:11,333
- How much further?
- One kilometer.

1047
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:25,875
How clever!

1048
01:19:26,292 --> 01:19:29,500
He demands a ransom,
we pay through her.

1049
01:19:29,792 --> 01:19:33,083
He runs with the money,
this madam pretends to chase him.

1050
01:19:33,917 --> 01:19:34,917
Hit her!

1051
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:36,500
Let her go!

1052
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:38,708
Leave her alone!

1053
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:40,375
She knows nothing.

1054
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:43,750
Are you upset?

1055
01:19:50,542 --> 01:19:52,083
No!

1056
01:23:26,917 --> 01:23:28,042
Handsome!

1057
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:33,167
You can't save him.

1058
01:23:34,083 --> 01:23:35,292
I'll kill him!

1059
01:23:35,625 --> 01:23:36,917
Who are you?!

1060
01:23:37,417 --> 01:23:38,458
Rathore.

1061
01:23:40,792 --> 01:23:42,000
Vikram Rathore.

1062
01:23:43,042 --> 01:23:44,458
You know my name.

1063
01:24:12,917 --> 01:24:14,083
Good evening, everyone.

1064
01:24:14,667 --> 01:24:16,625
No one would believe

1065
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,042
that the world's top industrialists
and businessmen like you

1066
01:24:20,708 --> 01:24:22,375
could still have unfulfilled dreams.

1067
01:24:22,875 --> 01:24:23,958
But I will fulfill them.

1068
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:27,167
You started your factories
in many countries.

1069
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:30,583
Their governments gave you permission,
but had to shut the factories down.

1070
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:31,875
Because of the protests.

1071
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:36,083
The protesters claimed you caused
environmental damage.

1072
01:24:36,542 --> 01:24:40,042
They said an accident at a factory
would kill thousands

1073
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:42,292
and future generations
could not live nearby.

1074
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:45,167
So the protesters successfully
got your factories sealed.

1075
01:24:45,708 --> 01:24:48,250
But there's a country where
you'll have no such problem.

1076
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:51,542
India has the best ecosystem
for our project.

1077
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:55,208
You'll get all the raw materials
and cheap labor you need.

1078
01:24:55,708 --> 01:24:59,250
We can use as much water
and air as we need.

1079
01:24:59,583 --> 01:25:00,875
No one will question us.

1080
01:25:00,958 --> 01:25:03,208
Because we'll generate employment
for thousands.

1081
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:04,833
Will your government accept this?

1082
01:25:04,917 --> 01:25:08,875
Yes. That's if we get to choose
the government.

1083
01:25:08,958 --> 01:25:10,167
How is it possible?

1084
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:12,226
The elections are in two months.

1085
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:13,851
We'll give the voters
10,000 rupees each.

1086
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:15,958
If we get fifty percent of the votes,

1087
01:25:17,042 --> 01:25:18,500
the next government is ours.

1088
01:25:18,583 --> 01:25:20,000
I am investing 20 percent.

1089
01:25:20,208 --> 01:25:22,042
I need support for 80 percent.

1090
01:25:23,167 --> 01:25:24,167
Anybody?

1091
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:26,958
I'll give.

1092
01:25:28,333 --> 01:25:32,583
Rest of the 80 percent
will be funded by me.

1093
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:34,708
Let's talk.

1094
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:40,792
This is mafia money.

1095
01:25:40,875 --> 01:25:42,583
If you mess with them,

1096
01:25:42,667 --> 01:25:46,167
they will mess with you in ways
you can't even imagine.

1097
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:48,833
I'm a man of my word.
Let's make a deal.

1098
01:25:49,833 --> 01:25:50,917
It's a deal.

1099
01:25:51,292 --> 01:25:53,458
- Deal.
- Sir, emergency call.

1100
01:26:06,167 --> 01:26:07,167
Manish.

1101
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:13,417
How many times have I told you?

1102
01:26:14,208 --> 01:26:17,958
A businessman must control
his emotions and his anger.

1103
01:26:19,542 --> 01:26:20,542
He didn't listen.

1104
01:26:21,542 --> 01:26:22,583
What did he want to prove?

1105
01:26:25,292 --> 01:26:26,292
No.

1106
01:26:28,708 --> 01:26:30,083
My dear boy.

1107
01:26:31,917 --> 01:26:34,458
If I set fire to the city to avenge him,

1108
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:39,000
he still won't come back.

1109
01:26:39,542 --> 01:26:41,917
Because he was my brother,
I will set the city on fire.

1110
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:51,292
Where is he?

1111
01:26:55,292 --> 01:26:57,875
The prime suspect is… Azad.

1112
01:26:58,917 --> 01:27:00,077
He's the warden of this jail.

1113
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:03,667
Six girls help Azad execute his plans.

1114
01:27:04,042 --> 01:27:05,802
They were seen at the crime scene
last night.

1115
01:27:06,083 --> 01:27:08,667
- Narmada!
<i>- I clearly remember one of them.</i>

1116
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:10,875
Dr. Eeram.

1117
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,917
In exchange for the Minister,
Azad's first demand was that

1118
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,375
justice be served to her.

1119
01:27:16,833 --> 01:27:18,792
Helana, an ethical hacker.

1120
01:27:19,125 --> 01:27:21,417
A hacker helped Azad
to execute both his plans.

1121
01:27:22,542 --> 01:27:24,750
Kalki, a farmer's daughter.

1122
01:27:25,292 --> 01:27:28,500
What links these girls?
Barrack number three.

1123
01:27:28,875 --> 01:27:30,875
There are other convicts
in the barrack as well.

1124
01:27:31,875 --> 01:27:34,667
Maybe the three other girls
live in the same barrack.

1125
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:35,875
Let's get them here.

1126
01:27:36,375 --> 01:27:37,625
Slap them around, they'll talk.

1127
01:27:37,708 --> 01:27:40,125
No matter what you do,
they won't talk.

1128
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:41,500
What do you suggest, ma'am?

1129
01:27:42,167 --> 01:27:44,333
If they won't trust me,
who will they trust?

1130
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:47,208
I'm Azad's wife.

1131
01:27:49,625 --> 01:27:51,458
Irani, how many men on duty tonight?

1132
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:54,333
Our men have replaced the jail staff.

1133
01:27:55,292 --> 01:27:58,500
- No information can be leaked to him.
- Where's Suji?

1134
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:02,167
- Suji.
- Mama!

1135
01:28:05,542 --> 01:28:06,542
Mama!

1136
01:28:07,417 --> 01:28:08,875
What are you doing here?

1137
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:11,292
Why are you in prison uniform?

1138
01:28:11,417 --> 01:28:16,125
Sorry. I'm on a police operation.
That's why.

1139
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:17,542
Till I get home,

1140
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:19,500
don't talk to anyone.

1141
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,792
Whatever happens,
don't trust anyone.

1142
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:25,292
Listen only to Uncle Irani.

1143
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,875
Come out of the room only
when he says so.

1144
01:28:29,042 --> 01:28:30,042
Okay?

1145
01:28:33,417 --> 01:28:34,417
Mama!

1146
01:28:35,417 --> 01:28:36,500
Where's Papa?

1147
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:39,000
This operation is about finding him.

1148
01:28:40,833 --> 01:28:41,833
I'll get him.

1149
01:28:47,375 --> 01:28:48,375
Check.

1150
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:50,500
Hit me, Irani.

1151
01:28:51,375 --> 01:28:52,542
Ma'am… I can't.

1152
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:02,708
- Azad! Azad!
- Azad! Azad!

1153
01:29:02,917 --> 01:29:06,167
- Azad! Azad!
- Azad! Azad!

1154
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:11,250
- Azad! Azad!
- Azad! Azad!

1155
01:29:11,333 --> 01:29:15,833
- Azad! Azad!
- Azad! Azad!

1156
01:29:18,542 --> 01:29:19,667
Lakshmi…

1157
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:23,750
Drink.

1158
01:29:26,125 --> 01:29:27,875
Azad! Azad!

1159
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:32,042
I used to be an honest police officer.

1160
01:29:32,542 --> 01:29:34,667
I'm here because of him.

1161
01:29:35,625 --> 01:29:37,833
He's not the messiah you think he is!

1162
01:29:38,333 --> 01:29:39,333
He's a fraud.

1163
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:44,667
He used me and my ten-year-old daughter.

1164
01:29:45,708 --> 01:29:48,500
He's a fraud.
He's a bloody criminal.

1165
01:29:52,583 --> 01:29:53,917
You have the a right to be angry.

1166
01:29:56,583 --> 01:29:58,417
But before you understand
who Azad is,

1167
01:29:59,958 --> 01:30:01,500
you must know…

1168
01:30:02,833 --> 01:30:04,208
who Vikram Rathore is.

1169
01:30:05,542 --> 01:30:06,625
And who Aishwarya is.

1170
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:11,792
Makkan Singh and Bunty Tidda
have started their bout.

1171
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:16,833
Makkan Singh has hurled Bunty Tidda
like a spinning top.

1172
01:30:16,917 --> 01:30:19,917
Who dares to challenge this mountain?

1173
01:30:20,417 --> 01:30:22,000
One hand is up.

1174
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:25,833
Our Vikram Rathore!

1175
01:30:27,292 --> 01:30:28,917
- Come on!
- What are you doing?

1176
01:30:30,417 --> 01:30:31,417
Hey!

1177
01:30:33,292 --> 01:30:35,083
This boy's a hero!

1178
01:30:37,792 --> 01:30:39,625
Vikram Rathore.

1179
01:30:40,792 --> 01:30:43,375
No one has ever beaten
Makkan Singh.

1180
01:30:50,625 --> 01:30:52,708
Makkan Singh is out cold!

1181
01:30:54,667 --> 01:30:56,750
Now who'll challenge Vikram Rathore?

1182
01:30:56,958 --> 01:31:00,417
Whose hand went up?
Step forward.

1183
01:31:13,583 --> 01:31:16,167
- You'll lose.
- I lost to you ages ago.

1184
01:31:35,625 --> 01:31:36,625
Unstoppable!

1185
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:47,625
<i>O girl</i>

1186
01:31:47,708 --> 01:31:49,208
<i>You're unstoppable</i>

1187
01:31:49,292 --> 01:31:51,958
<i>You've cast a spell on my heart</i>

1188
01:31:53,167 --> 01:31:56,958
<i>Love's sparklers burst all around me</i>

1189
01:31:57,042 --> 01:31:59,792
<i>Since the day I met you</i>

1190
01:32:00,083 --> 01:32:04,583
<i>My beauty spreads all around</i>

1191
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:06,917
<i>It wanders down your street</i>

1192
01:32:08,042 --> 01:32:12,333
<i>Keep your eyes fixed on me</i>

1193
01:32:12,583 --> 01:32:16,417
<i>Rob me of my heart when you please</i>

1194
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,583
<i>O girl</i>

1195
01:32:18,667 --> 01:32:20,167
<i>You're unstoppable</i>

1196
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:22,542
<i>You've cast a spell on my heart</i>

1197
01:32:24,125 --> 01:32:27,958
<i>Love's sparklers burst all around me</i>

1198
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:31,167
<i>Since the day I met you</i>

1199
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:43,000
<i>O stealer of hearts</i>

1200
01:32:43,167 --> 01:32:45,000
<i>Don't ignore me</i>

1201
01:32:45,125 --> 01:32:47,042
<i>Come closer</i>

1202
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:50,833
<i>Drop your attitude Hold my hand</i>

1203
01:32:50,917 --> 01:32:54,833
<i>No one can match you</i>

1204
01:32:58,958 --> 01:33:02,750
<i>I'm the queen You are my king</i>

1205
01:33:02,833 --> 01:33:06,042
<i>We make an amazing couple</i>

1206
01:33:06,625 --> 01:33:10,417
<i>I will love you so deeply</i>

1207
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:13,667
<i>You'll yearn for my love forever</i>

1208
01:33:14,333 --> 01:33:16,000
<i>Your eyes bewitch me</i>

1209
01:33:16,083 --> 01:33:17,833
<i>How can I think straight?</i>

1210
01:33:18,333 --> 01:33:21,417
<i>I may blunder in my excitement</i>

1211
01:33:22,167 --> 01:33:25,583
<i>We'll dance to celebrate love</i>

1212
01:33:26,042 --> 01:33:29,625
<i>As we wander, you, me You, me</i>

1213
01:33:32,125 --> 01:33:33,833
<i>Unstoppable!</i>

1214
01:33:36,042 --> 01:33:37,875
<i>Firecracker!</i>

1215
01:33:39,917 --> 01:33:41,625
<i>Unstoppable!</i>

1216
01:33:43,792 --> 01:33:45,875
<i>Firecracker!</i>

1217
01:33:49,375 --> 01:33:51,917
Ten days ago, terrorists…

1218
01:33:52,167 --> 01:33:54,167
kidnapped 40 truck drivers at the border.

1219
01:33:54,292 --> 01:33:55,792
All 40 are Indians.

1220
01:34:04,542 --> 01:34:07,292
A team was dispatched
to rescue them.

1221
01:34:07,375 --> 01:34:08,500
Of the 32 soldiers…

1222
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:37,958
The terrorists
have held six soldiers hostage.

1223
01:34:38,667 --> 01:34:40,167
I want those 40 drivers

1224
01:34:40,375 --> 01:34:43,667
and our six soldiers
brought home safely.

1225
01:34:43,958 --> 01:34:46,625
I can't send the regular team
on this mission,

1226
01:34:46,792 --> 01:34:50,167
so I've called in special ops.

1227
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:52,792
It's not just about saving
our people,

1228
01:34:52,958 --> 01:34:58,000
it's also to reassure the billion Indians
who trust us.

1229
01:34:58,708 --> 01:35:01,292
The terrorists must think
they frighten us.

1230
01:35:02,542 --> 01:35:05,833
We'll show them the true meaning of fear.

1231
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,750
Am I clear?

1232
01:35:09,125 --> 01:35:10,042
Roger that.

1233
01:35:10,125 --> 01:35:11,125
- Sir!
- Sir!

1234
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:40,042
The gun isn't firing.

1235
01:36:03,333 --> 01:36:04,458
Mahajan!

1236
01:36:10,458 --> 01:36:11,792
Easy. Sit here.

1237
01:36:13,292 --> 01:36:14,917
- You okay?
- Our guns aren't working.

1238
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
My gun too.

1239
01:36:16,125 --> 01:36:17,667
- Mine too.
- What's going on, Captain?

1240
01:36:18,083 --> 01:36:19,875
Take their guns. Go, go, go.

1241
01:36:19,958 --> 01:36:21,208
- Yes, Captain.
- Mahajan…

1242
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:23,750
You'll be okay.

1243
01:36:24,083 --> 01:36:25,083
Stay safe.

1244
01:36:59,708 --> 01:37:00,708
Sorry, Captain.

1245
01:37:00,917 --> 01:37:03,583
Pappu!

1246
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:38,167
<i>We would now
like to present this medal</i>

1247
01:37:38,375 --> 01:37:41,292
<i>to the Agni Team and their captain,
Vikram Rathore.</i>

1248
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:50,583
We would now request
Captain Vikram Rathore to say a few words.

1249
01:37:52,792 --> 01:37:54,208
Today this medal weighs…

1250
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:57,750
so heavy on me.

1251
01:37:58,208 --> 01:38:01,208
Because I'm thinking of those
27 soldiers,

1252
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:03,042
those 27 brothers,

1253
01:38:03,292 --> 01:38:05,250
who lost their lives in this operation.

1254
01:38:05,958 --> 01:38:07,792
We were surrounded by the enemy,

1255
01:38:07,875 --> 01:38:10,542
we were armed, but defenseless.

1256
01:38:11,625 --> 01:38:16,458
All the MI436 guns
had stopped working.

1257
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:17,875
They died on us.

1258
01:38:18,208 --> 01:38:21,625
The same thing happened
to the unit sent there earlier.

1259
01:38:22,458 --> 01:38:28,500
<i>According to the initial inquiry,
the guns came from the same company.</i>

1260
01:38:34,917 --> 01:38:38,917
<i>That's the reason our brave soldiers
needlessly lost their lives.</i>

1261
01:38:39,208 --> 01:38:40,667
I would like to ask the High Command

1262
01:38:41,125 --> 01:38:45,042
to carry out a special inquiry
into our weapons supplier.

1263
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,500
We must know the truth

1264
01:38:48,083 --> 01:38:50,625
so that no soldier can ever
be cheated like this again.

1265
01:38:51,708 --> 01:38:52,708
<i>Jai Hind.</i>

1266
01:38:54,917 --> 01:38:57,292
Who supplied us the MI436 guns?

1267
01:38:57,375 --> 01:38:58,375
Kalee Gaikwad, sir.

1268
01:39:03,333 --> 01:39:05,917
Sir, you've been summoned.

1269
01:39:06,542 --> 01:39:07,542
Why?

1270
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:10,292
Our guns malfunctioned in action.

1271
01:39:10,708 --> 01:39:12,167
Many soldiers died as a result.

1272
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,708
So the guns failed!
Why didn't they use their fists?

1273
01:39:16,333 --> 01:39:19,458
Some soldiers are bound to die, right?

1274
01:39:20,125 --> 01:39:21,125
Yes, sir.

1275
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:25,042
- Who is he?
- Vikram Rathore.

1276
01:39:25,917 --> 01:39:27,875
- Is he some prince?
- No, a soldier.

1277
01:39:28,542 --> 01:39:29,542
A soldier?

1278
01:39:30,958 --> 01:39:32,042
Let me see him.

1279
01:39:33,333 --> 01:39:34,333
You may leave.

1280
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:36,250
Yes, sir.

1281
01:39:43,125 --> 01:39:45,542
Mr. Kalee,
because of your faulty guns,

1282
01:39:45,625 --> 01:39:48,542
twenty-seven soldiers have died.

1283
01:39:48,708 --> 01:39:50,109
What do you have to say about that?

1284
01:39:50,875 --> 01:39:51,917
It's my mistake.

1285
01:39:53,417 --> 01:39:54,833
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

1286
01:39:55,417 --> 01:39:56,875
Let me explain, sir.

1287
01:39:57,417 --> 01:40:01,250
Our company guns come
with a manual that's in the kit box.

1288
01:40:01,708 --> 01:40:03,167
It's written in a foreign language.

1289
01:40:03,875 --> 01:40:09,125
I know, Your Honor, but not everyone
can read it, or understand it.

1290
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:11,650
Because it's in a foreign language.

1291
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:14,333
To use the guns in action,

1292
01:40:14,708 --> 01:40:18,917
at least 30 days training is needed.

1293
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:21,708
It's my fault, sir.

1294
01:40:22,708 --> 01:40:24,908
But my company will take care
of everything, Your Honor.

1295
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:28,667
Whatever compensation you ask
for these soldiers

1296
01:40:29,042 --> 01:40:30,208
and their families…

1297
01:40:30,667 --> 01:40:31,750
We will settle, sir.

1298
01:40:32,167 --> 01:40:37,625
I can call experts from my company,
at my expense,

1299
01:40:37,792 --> 01:40:39,375
to provide training for our soldiers.

1300
01:40:39,458 --> 01:40:42,833
To teach them how to use
these new age weapons.

1301
01:40:44,625 --> 01:40:46,917
It's a human error, not a machine error.

1302
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:50,375
Right, Mr. Rathore? Deal?

1303
01:40:52,375 --> 01:40:55,958
Mr. Kalee, may I give you a demo
of what happened at the border that day?

1304
01:40:57,125 --> 01:40:58,125
According to the manual.

1305
01:41:00,625 --> 01:41:01,625
Go ahead.

1306
01:41:07,208 --> 01:41:08,208
Here, Mr. Kalee.

1307
01:41:08,792 --> 01:41:12,083
This is the same gun we used.
We first loaded it.

1308
01:41:13,833 --> 01:41:14,833
Okay.

1309
01:41:15,250 --> 01:41:17,625
Then we unlocked the safety lever.

1310
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:20,750
Good.

1311
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,542
And then we took aim.

1312
01:41:25,667 --> 01:41:26,667
What's next, Mr. Kalee?

1313
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:28,000
According to the manual?

1314
01:41:28,708 --> 01:41:30,500
Pull the trigger. It will shoot.

1315
01:41:33,125 --> 01:41:34,125
Let's see.

1316
01:41:36,792 --> 01:41:38,167
- Hey!
- Sir!

1317
01:41:38,875 --> 01:41:40,667
Vikram, is this a joke?

1318
01:41:46,958 --> 01:41:47,958
It's no joke, sir.

1319
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:49,542
This gun is a joke.

1320
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,583
Train as much you want,
these guns won't work.

1321
01:41:54,708 --> 01:41:56,149
This is what happened at the border.

1322
01:41:56,750 --> 01:41:58,375
We were surrounded by the enemy,

1323
01:41:58,708 --> 01:42:00,250
bullets were raining down on us,

1324
01:42:00,583 --> 01:42:02,625
we confronted them with these faulty guns.

1325
01:42:03,208 --> 01:42:04,208
Defenseless!

1326
01:42:06,833 --> 01:42:08,500
The lives of 27 soldiers…

1327
01:42:09,917 --> 01:42:11,208
were lost, Mr. Kalee.

1328
01:42:13,333 --> 01:42:14,333
I'm a soldier.

1329
01:42:15,958 --> 01:42:18,958
I can give my life not once,
but a thousand times.

1330
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:21,292
But for my country.

1331
01:42:22,083 --> 01:42:23,375
Not for your deals,

1332
01:42:23,917 --> 01:42:25,708
or for your profits.

1333
01:42:26,542 --> 01:42:29,167
That's not why I would risk my life.

1334
01:42:30,542 --> 01:42:31,542
And you are right.

1335
01:42:32,458 --> 01:42:33,625
It's a human error.

1336
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:39,583
Your… your human error.

1337
01:42:42,583 --> 01:42:45,833
So, Kalee, no deal.

1338
01:42:51,958 --> 01:42:56,542
Keep all contracts
with Kalee Gaikwad's company on hold.

1339
01:42:56,667 --> 01:42:58,500
If he's found guilty,

1340
01:42:59,083 --> 01:43:02,083
his company will be permanently
blacklisted.

1341
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,625
Mummy's pet!

1342
01:43:06,708 --> 01:43:09,375
One day I'll eat you up
like a hot dog.

1343
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,792
Whenever I see you,
it's like the first time.

1344
01:43:18,958 --> 01:43:21,375
- Kiss, kiss, kiss.
- First go bathe!

1345
01:43:22,083 --> 01:43:23,208
You bathe me today!

1346
01:43:25,875 --> 01:43:26,750
Hey!

1347
01:43:26,875 --> 01:43:29,500
What you looking at?
She's my wife! Go!

1348
01:43:40,708 --> 01:43:41,708
Scoot!

1349
01:43:46,167 --> 01:43:47,167
I love you.

1350
01:43:50,208 --> 01:43:51,500
- You should've bathed.
- Later.

1351
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:55,333
Rio?

1352
01:43:55,417 --> 01:43:56,417
I'll check.

1353
01:43:56,458 --> 01:43:58,417
Stay here, Aishwarya.

1354
01:44:29,958 --> 01:44:30,958
Let them go.

1355
01:44:42,125 --> 01:44:43,375
Rathore!

1356
01:44:46,833 --> 01:44:48,542
You'll court martial me?

1357
01:44:50,458 --> 01:44:52,333
You'll start an inquiry against me?

1358
01:44:55,750 --> 01:44:56,750
Aishwarya…

1359
01:44:56,792 --> 01:44:59,500
- A dying fish always flaps about.
- Aishwarya…

1360
01:44:59,792 --> 01:45:01,208
Just like him.

1361
01:45:02,083 --> 01:45:03,083
Take him away.

1362
01:45:05,875 --> 01:45:08,667
- Don't underestimate his wife.
- Yes, sir.

1363
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:22,583
Rio!

1364
01:45:23,625 --> 01:45:27,292
Rio…

1365
01:45:28,667 --> 01:45:30,333
So you've come round?

1366
01:45:34,375 --> 01:45:36,583
Easy!

1367
01:45:37,292 --> 01:45:39,500
This incriminating evidence
was found in your home.

1368
01:45:41,458 --> 01:45:45,125
Your husband used a satellite phone
to pass on sensitive information.

1369
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:49,708
He earned this money
by selling defense secrets.

1370
01:45:50,125 --> 01:45:52,375
We have all the proof we need.

1371
01:45:53,875 --> 01:45:55,417
Your husband is a traitor.

1372
01:45:57,292 --> 01:46:00,458
But you are innocent.
You knew nothing about it.

1373
01:46:00,917 --> 01:46:02,042
That's the reason…

1374
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:04,667
I've prepared a statement.

1375
01:46:05,292 --> 01:46:09,208
Put your lovely signature on it,
then go free.

1376
01:46:09,875 --> 01:46:12,042
Or else you see those two cops?

1377
01:46:13,042 --> 01:46:15,875
If I step out for a quick tea,

1378
01:46:16,458 --> 01:46:17,739
who knows what they'd do to you.

1379
01:46:19,875 --> 01:46:23,250
You're sensible. Sign it. Come on.

1380
01:46:42,792 --> 01:46:44,583
Answer us!

1381
01:46:52,125 --> 01:46:53,125
Aishwarya.

1382
01:46:53,167 --> 01:46:54,833
A Mr. Vikram wants to see you.
Come.

1383
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Not Vikram.

1384
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:07,375
My name is Kalee.
I studied in a corporation school,

1385
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:09,250
in a small village near Ceekakulam.

1386
01:47:09,792 --> 01:47:12,500
I'm the fourth largest
weapon dealer in the world.

1387
01:47:13,042 --> 01:47:14,500
That's a big deal.

1388
01:47:15,208 --> 01:47:18,500
If anyone threatens my empire…

1389
01:47:18,625 --> 01:47:19,625
Where's Vikram?

1390
01:47:27,792 --> 01:47:29,167
We've crossed the border, sir.

1391
01:47:44,625 --> 01:47:45,625
That day…

1392
01:47:45,917 --> 01:47:48,792
the gun you pointed at me
should've fired.

1393
01:47:49,042 --> 01:47:50,750
If it had, I'd be dead.

1394
01:47:51,333 --> 01:47:53,542
The damn thing didn't work.
And I got away.

1395
01:47:54,792 --> 01:47:57,042
But my honor, my name

1396
01:47:57,333 --> 01:47:59,917
and reputation were ruined.

1397
01:48:00,208 --> 01:48:03,167
So what should I do now, Rathore?

1398
01:48:03,333 --> 01:48:04,333
Murad!

1399
01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:06,250
Sir.

1400
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,125
Here's the magazine.

1401
01:48:11,708 --> 01:48:13,250
I've loaded it.

1402
01:48:13,875 --> 01:48:15,667
The safety lock has been released.

1403
01:48:16,083 --> 01:48:17,542
The gun is ready.

1404
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:20,250
I have my sights on the target.

1405
01:48:21,958 --> 01:48:23,458
What should I do, Rathore?

1406
01:48:24,042 --> 01:48:25,500
Pull the trigger.

1407
01:48:28,125 --> 01:48:29,583
It will shoot.

1408
01:48:29,708 --> 01:48:30,792
Bye, Rathore!

1409
01:48:32,208 --> 01:48:33,583
Bye!

1410
01:48:38,417 --> 01:48:40,167
Get out of my world!

1411
01:48:58,917 --> 01:49:00,458
I killed your husband.

1412
01:49:02,583 --> 01:49:06,125
But… that hasn't satiated my anger.

1413
01:49:06,625 --> 01:49:09,375
That's why I came to see you.
You should know…

1414
01:49:10,917 --> 01:49:13,917
that hanging
is a very interesting process.

1415
01:49:15,333 --> 01:49:17,500
One jerk, one snap.

1416
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,583
- Let me explain.
- Sir.

1417
01:49:20,542 --> 01:49:23,417
First, they cover the head
with a black hood.

1418
01:49:24,417 --> 01:49:25,917
A noose is tied around the neck.

1419
01:49:28,125 --> 01:49:29,500
The hangman pulls the lever.

1420
01:49:31,833 --> 01:49:34,000
A trapdoor opens under the feet
with a sharp sound.

1421
01:49:34,833 --> 01:49:38,042
Your neck is snaps and you…

1422
01:49:43,417 --> 01:49:45,250
Your eyes will pop out.

1423
01:49:46,167 --> 01:49:48,542
Your tongue will hang out of your mouth.
Like this…

1424
01:49:50,167 --> 01:49:51,167
Try it.

1425
01:50:03,583 --> 01:50:04,708
Give my regards to Vikram.

1426
01:50:07,167 --> 01:50:08,208
Rest in peace.

1427
01:50:19,583 --> 01:50:20,458
Hey!

1428
01:50:20,542 --> 01:50:21,417
Doctor.

1429
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:22,875
She must've had a panic attack.

1430
01:50:27,833 --> 01:50:29,333
She didn't faint out of fear.

1431
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,000
She's pregnant.

1432
01:50:31,417 --> 01:50:32,333
What!

1433
01:50:32,417 --> 01:50:34,917
In that case, we can't proceed
with the hanging today.

1434
01:50:35,333 --> 01:50:38,208
According to Indian law,
if a convict is pregnant,

1435
01:50:38,375 --> 01:50:42,500
she cannot be hung
till the child is five years old.

1436
01:50:42,583 --> 01:50:45,708
Postponing the execution
until the child turns five.

1437
01:50:46,125 --> 01:50:48,125
Aishwarya!

1438
01:50:51,958 --> 01:50:52,958
You're pregnant.

1439
01:50:53,208 --> 01:50:56,000
<i>You blossomed in a prison</i>

1440
01:50:56,250 --> 01:50:58,458
<i>You are a flower, a lion</i>

1441
01:50:59,083 --> 01:51:00,708
<i>I know</i>

1442
01:51:00,833 --> 01:51:04,000
<i>You will chase away the darkness</i>

1443
01:51:04,083 --> 01:51:06,667
<i>The one who blossomed in a prison</i>

1444
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:09,708
<i>You are a flower, a lion</i>

1445
01:51:09,792 --> 01:51:12,000
<i>I know</i>

1446
01:51:12,083 --> 01:51:14,875
<i>You will chase away the darkness</i>

1447
01:51:20,458 --> 01:51:23,042
<i>Near ones and strangers</i>

1448
01:51:23,167 --> 01:51:28,542
<i>All cherish you in their hearts</i>

1449
01:51:31,292 --> 01:51:38,292
<i>All cherish you in their hearts</i>

1450
01:51:42,292 --> 01:51:44,958
<i>You are the bright sun</i>

1451
01:51:45,083 --> 01:51:50,083
<i>The star of courage</i>

1452
01:51:53,667 --> 01:51:58,833
<i>Young Krishna, the world awaits you</i>

1453
01:51:58,917 --> 01:52:02,750
<i>Young Krishna, the world is yours</i>

1454
01:52:02,833 --> 01:52:06,250
<i>Like the silvery moon</i>

1455
01:52:06,333 --> 01:52:09,042
<i>Like the glittering sun</i>

1456
01:52:09,125 --> 01:52:13,583
<i>Everyone rejoices
When they lay eyes on you</i>

1457
01:52:14,875 --> 01:52:17,667
<i>Near ones and strangers</i>

1458
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:22,750
<i>All cherish you in their hearts</i>

1459
01:53:09,542 --> 01:53:12,292
<i>The one who blossomed in a prison</i>

1460
01:53:12,375 --> 01:53:14,958
<i>You are a flower, a lion</i>

1461
01:53:15,458 --> 01:53:17,167
<i>I know</i>

1462
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:20,750
<i>You will chase away the darkness</i>

1463
01:53:20,917 --> 01:53:26,083
<i>If anyone comes in your way</i>

1464
01:53:31,833 --> 01:53:35,792
<i>If anyone comes in your way</i>

1465
01:53:37,333 --> 01:53:41,958
<i>Ride past them like a storm</i>

1466
01:53:42,667 --> 01:53:45,333
<i>Strike like a lightning bolt</i>

1467
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:48,208
<i>Spread like a rain cloud</i>

1468
01:53:48,292 --> 01:53:51,875
<i>Young Krishna, you belong to us all</i>

1469
01:53:51,958 --> 01:53:58,125
<i>If you ever stumble
Your mother will steady your fall</i>

1470
01:53:58,208 --> 01:54:02,792
<i>You are courage itself</i>

1471
01:54:14,958 --> 01:54:17,667
<i>Near ones and strangers</i>

1472
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:22,667
<i>All cherish you in their hearts</i>

1473
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:50,292
<i>The one who blossomed in a prison</i>

1474
01:54:50,375 --> 01:54:53,167
<i>You are a flower, a lion</i>

1475
01:54:53,708 --> 01:54:55,208
<i>I know</i>

1476
01:54:55,292 --> 01:54:59,000
<i>You will chase away the darkness</i>

1477
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,625
- Azad.
- Ma.

1478
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,083
Make me a promise.

1479
01:55:08,875 --> 01:55:10,708
Azad, your father is no longer
in this world.

1480
01:55:12,375 --> 01:55:15,083
But his strength and courage…

1481
01:55:16,750 --> 01:55:18,167
will always be with you.

1482
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,250
When you grow up,
you must prove to the world

1483
01:55:22,792 --> 01:55:24,083
that he was not a traitor,

1484
01:55:25,375 --> 01:55:26,375
but a patriot.

1485
01:55:27,833 --> 01:55:28,833
Promise me?

1486
01:55:30,083 --> 01:55:32,292
There are many mothers in this jail,

1487
01:55:34,375 --> 01:55:35,750
innocent like me.

1488
01:55:37,083 --> 01:55:39,792
When you grow up, help these women.

1489
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:42,625
Make their lives better.

1490
01:55:44,292 --> 01:55:45,500
Will you do that for me?

1491
01:55:49,250 --> 01:55:50,708
You won't understand now,

1492
01:55:51,208 --> 01:55:54,375
but when you grow up, the warden,

1493
01:56:01,542 --> 01:56:03,000
Kaveri Amma,

1494
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:06,500
will explain everything.

1495
01:56:08,583 --> 01:56:09,625
Your hand.

1496
01:56:18,083 --> 01:56:19,083
Come.

1497
01:56:39,125 --> 01:56:40,667
Ma!

1498
01:56:42,417 --> 01:56:46,250
Ma!

1499
01:57:06,833 --> 01:57:09,375
Ma!

1500
01:57:11,542 --> 01:57:13,875
Ma!

1501
01:57:20,625 --> 01:57:23,250
Ma!

1502
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Azad!

1503
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,042
Kaveri was the warden back then.

1504
01:57:48,333 --> 01:57:51,958
She adopted Azad and educated him.

1505
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:55,625
Then Azad returned to this jail
where Aishwarya once lived.

1506
01:57:56,125 --> 01:57:57,458
He was the new warden.

1507
01:57:57,708 --> 01:57:59,750
Azad saw his mother in us all.

1508
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:02,708
He helped us like a son.

1509
01:58:03,875 --> 01:58:06,375
We six teamed up with Azad.

1510
01:58:07,292 --> 01:58:08,792
We did many good deeds.

1511
01:58:09,458 --> 01:58:11,417
The world knows about these deeds,

1512
01:58:11,750 --> 01:58:15,000
but no one knew we were behind them.

1513
01:58:15,667 --> 01:58:18,708
Where's Azad? I must see him.

1514
01:58:20,792 --> 01:58:23,583
Azad is in a safe place.

1515
01:58:34,667 --> 01:58:35,667
Father…

1516
01:58:38,250 --> 01:58:40,292
Where am I? Who are you?

1517
01:58:48,500 --> 01:58:49,500
You?

1518
01:58:51,333 --> 01:58:53,208
<i>When I saw you</i>

1519
01:58:53,458 --> 01:58:56,583
<i>you reminded me of the messiah
who lived in our village.</i>

1520
01:58:57,208 --> 01:59:00,917
<i>Vikram Rathore.
That's the name I found.</i>

1521
01:59:01,792 --> 01:59:05,000
<i>To solve the puzzle,
I contacted the IMA.</i>

1522
01:59:05,792 --> 01:59:08,458
<i>I was told about the Agni Regiment.</i>

1523
01:59:09,125 --> 01:59:13,083
<i>They said each member had
a tattoo on their wrist,</i>

1524
01:59:13,583 --> 01:59:16,958
<i>and that four of the six men
were still alive</i>

1525
01:59:18,208 --> 01:59:19,250
<i>I tracked all four.</i>

1526
01:59:19,583 --> 01:59:22,250
<i>I told them about
their missing friend.</i>

1527
01:59:22,667 --> 01:59:24,542
<i>I told them he was still alive.</i>

1528
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:28,625
<i>Our messiah had lost his memory.</i>

1529
01:59:29,083 --> 01:59:31,583
<i>I remembered my promise,</i>

1530
01:59:31,667 --> 01:59:32,875
<i>and fulfilled it.</i>

1531
01:59:32,958 --> 01:59:33,958
Ma!

1532
01:59:40,917 --> 01:59:41,917
Who are you?

1533
01:59:46,708 --> 01:59:48,042
Who am I?

1534
01:59:48,792 --> 01:59:51,792
When I grow up, I'll find out

1535
01:59:52,250 --> 01:59:53,250
who you are.

1536
01:59:53,333 --> 01:59:54,958
<i>I promise.</i>

1537
02:00:01,542 --> 02:00:02,542
Father…

1538
02:00:02,875 --> 02:00:04,333
I was told that you…

1539
02:00:05,333 --> 02:00:06,333
What?

1540
02:00:06,583 --> 02:00:09,500
I could never have imagined
one day you would…

1541
02:00:13,042 --> 02:00:15,833
Father, all that I've ever done…

1542
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:17,375
Everything was…

1543
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:20,500
for your sake.

1544
02:00:22,208 --> 02:00:23,917
They called you a traitor.

1545
02:00:24,958 --> 02:00:26,333
Today, the whole country…

1546
02:00:27,458 --> 02:00:28,458
considers you a hero.

1547
02:00:28,750 --> 02:00:30,750
My dad is a hero.

1548
02:00:34,458 --> 02:00:35,667
Why won't he talk?

1549
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:37,500
He understands everything.

1550
02:00:38,208 --> 02:00:42,208
But remembers nothing.
Everything sounds like a story to him.

1551
02:00:43,208 --> 02:00:47,292
His muscle memory allows
his reflexes work.

1552
02:00:47,833 --> 02:00:50,042
Driving, swimming, firing, shooting.

1553
02:00:50,375 --> 02:00:53,833
He can do it all except for
remembering his past.

1554
02:00:53,917 --> 02:00:57,042
Enough! You sending me
to compete in the Olympics?

1555
02:00:57,792 --> 02:00:58,792
Handsome!

1556
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,167
They said you're my son.

1557
02:01:02,750 --> 02:01:04,750
I get that.

1558
02:01:05,958 --> 02:01:09,250
But I have no feelings, you know.

1559
02:01:10,667 --> 02:01:14,042
What should a father feel for his son?

1560
02:01:14,125 --> 02:01:15,458
I don't know. I'm sorry.

1561
02:01:15,542 --> 02:01:16,417
But,

1562
02:01:16,542 --> 02:01:17,792
when it comes to your fight,

1563
02:01:17,917 --> 02:01:20,833
we'll stand by you like shields.

1564
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:22,750
Like soldiers.

1565
02:01:23,208 --> 02:01:26,750
We could even die for you.
We're ready.

1566
02:01:28,250 --> 02:01:29,250
I'll…

1567
02:01:30,208 --> 02:01:31,750
always be there for you.

1568
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:33,500
Always.

1569
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:37,500
My son.

1570
02:01:42,417 --> 02:01:44,292
Okay. You can cry but…

1571
02:01:45,167 --> 02:01:46,833
don't kiss, please.

1572
02:01:48,125 --> 02:01:50,375
Boss, let's go home.

1573
02:01:50,875 --> 02:01:52,000
The ceremony's started.

1574
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:54,500
The team will handle this consignment.

1575
02:01:56,250 --> 02:01:57,250
No, Murad.

1576
02:01:57,417 --> 02:02:01,375
My paymasters will think
I've gone weak because of brother's death.

1577
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:04,458
They won't trust me.
Let's finish the job.

1578
02:02:04,542 --> 02:02:05,542
Yes, sir.

1579
02:02:05,583 --> 02:02:07,125
Sir, Mr. D.

1580
02:02:08,458 --> 02:02:09,542
We've received your money.

1581
02:02:09,958 --> 02:02:13,500
The next call you'll get
is from the new system's leader.

1582
02:02:13,708 --> 02:02:14,708
Good.

1583
02:02:16,667 --> 02:02:19,417
IPS madam! Get up.

1584
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:21,141
They've called you for the interrogation.

1585
02:02:21,708 --> 02:02:23,083
- Me?
- No.

1586
02:02:24,417 --> 02:02:26,125
- Azad! Azad!
- Azad! Azad!

1587
02:02:26,208 --> 02:02:29,292
- Azad! Azad!
- Azad! Azad!

1588
02:02:29,458 --> 02:02:32,292
Sir, they've called Narmada
for the investigation.

1589
02:02:32,375 --> 02:02:34,792
Let's go. What are you waiting for?

1590
02:02:45,958 --> 02:02:47,542
- The interrogation room.
- Yes, sir.

1591
02:02:55,333 --> 02:02:56,333
Come.

1592
02:02:57,625 --> 02:02:59,333
I want to tell you a story.

1593
02:03:00,583 --> 02:03:03,667
Once upon a time, in a village,
there lived a soldier.

1594
02:03:03,750 --> 02:03:06,208
His name was Vikram Rathore.

1595
02:03:07,875 --> 02:03:10,500
And his wife's name was Aishwarya.

1596
02:03:11,708 --> 02:03:13,125
Story sounds familiar?

1597
02:03:16,208 --> 02:03:18,208
Irani, what are you doing?

1598
02:03:21,833 --> 02:03:22,833
Here.

1599
02:03:26,958 --> 02:03:28,458
Look at this.

1600
02:03:30,708 --> 02:03:31,708
I overheard everything.

1601
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:34,500
What do you think?

1602
02:03:35,833 --> 02:03:37,667
I was working only for you?

1603
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
No.

1604
02:03:41,708 --> 02:03:42,708
Yes?

1605
02:03:44,583 --> 02:03:47,083
I work for Kalee too.

1606
02:03:47,417 --> 02:03:48,458
You…

1607
02:03:48,542 --> 02:03:49,792
Let me go!

1608
02:03:55,875 --> 02:03:56,875
Hello, sir.

1609
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,125
Hi, Narmada. Thank you so much.

1610
02:03:59,708 --> 02:04:01,417
<i>I knew you could do the job.</i>

1611
02:04:01,958 --> 02:04:05,833
Irani, shall we recommend madam
for a bravery medal?

1612
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,560
She must be on duty to be martyred, no?

1613
02:04:07,667 --> 02:04:08,667
So martyr her.

1614
02:04:09,542 --> 02:04:10,708
She deserves a medal.

1615
02:04:10,875 --> 02:04:13,250
Sir, what about the others?

1616
02:04:13,583 --> 02:04:15,708
Be sure all my brother's wounds

1617
02:04:15,833 --> 02:04:17,833
are inflicted on the bodies
of these girls.

1618
02:04:17,917 --> 02:04:22,167
Before they die, they must tell you
where Azad is hiding.

1619
02:04:22,792 --> 02:04:24,208
What about Suji, sir?

1620
02:04:25,458 --> 02:04:27,250
Revenge should be complete.

1621
02:04:29,417 --> 02:04:31,333
Irani, don't you dare!

1622
02:04:32,625 --> 02:04:33,625
Irani!

1623
02:04:35,750 --> 02:04:37,250
- Hello, sweetie.
- Hi.

1624
02:04:40,625 --> 02:04:43,083
- Where are we going?
- To Papa.

1625
02:04:53,083 --> 02:04:54,083
All good.

1626
02:04:55,333 --> 02:04:57,333
- Let's go.
- Yes, Captain.

1627
02:05:09,083 --> 02:05:10,708
It's been an honor working with you.

1628
02:05:34,542 --> 02:05:38,708
<i>- Ramaiya Vastavaiya…</i>
- What's that?

1629
02:05:38,792 --> 02:05:42,875
<i>Ramaiya Vastavaiya…</i>

1630
02:05:43,042 --> 02:05:47,208
<i>I gave my heart to you</i>

1631
02:05:47,292 --> 02:05:48,792
<i>Ramaiya Vastavaiya...</i>

1632
02:06:43,083 --> 02:06:44,083
Show-off.

1633
02:07:03,042 --> 02:07:04,042
Papa!

1634
02:07:06,625 --> 02:07:08,417
Is she my child too?

1635
02:07:09,917 --> 02:07:10,917
No.

1636
02:07:12,958 --> 02:07:14,292
Hello.

1637
02:07:14,417 --> 02:07:18,333
<i>Ramaiya Vastavaiya…</i>

1638
02:07:19,917 --> 02:07:24,542
- Azad! Azad!
- Azad! Azad!

1639
02:07:24,833 --> 02:07:26,667
You cannot escape, Azad.

1640
02:07:26,917 --> 02:07:28,625
My men have infiltrated this jail.

1641
02:07:28,917 --> 02:07:30,417
My men!

1642
02:07:34,833 --> 02:07:35,875
Maybe your men are here,

1643
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,000
but this jail…

1644
02:07:41,583 --> 02:07:42,792
belongs to my women.

1645
02:08:03,750 --> 02:08:05,167
Collect all their phones.

1646
02:08:09,625 --> 02:08:10,625
Azad.

1647
02:08:13,375 --> 02:08:14,375
Narmada.

1648
02:08:29,417 --> 02:08:30,417
Lakshmi.

1649
02:08:32,417 --> 02:08:33,875
Sorry, Chief.

1650
02:08:51,833 --> 02:08:54,125
Eeram, help me.

1651
02:08:54,208 --> 02:08:55,958
I'm in terrible pain, Eeram.

1652
02:09:08,250 --> 02:09:09,583
Move. Get back.

1653
02:09:23,917 --> 02:09:25,042
Chhotu.

1654
02:09:28,750 --> 02:09:30,167
Be brave, Lakshmi.

1655
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:33,958
Chhotu, hold your breath.

1656
02:09:39,083 --> 02:09:41,250
<i>The poisonous gas from Kalee's factory…</i>

1657
02:09:41,833 --> 02:09:44,833
<i>wiped out many families.</i>

1658
02:09:45,625 --> 02:09:46,708
<i>Mine too.</i>

1659
02:10:06,875 --> 02:10:08,917
We can't let her go, Chief.

1660
02:10:31,958 --> 02:10:33,167
When we started…

1661
02:10:35,125 --> 02:10:36,500
- there were six of us.
- Yeah.

1662
02:10:39,250 --> 02:10:41,500
Nothing can stop us,
we'll keep going.

1663
02:10:42,500 --> 02:10:43,583
Even without Lakshmi.

1664
02:10:58,458 --> 02:10:59,833
I'll take Lakshmi's place.

1665
02:11:05,375 --> 02:11:09,000
All the money Kalee needs
to back his election candidates

1666
02:11:09,417 --> 02:11:10,667
is in these containers.

1667
02:11:10,750 --> 02:11:12,542
If they get the money on time,

1668
02:11:12,792 --> 02:11:14,592
the election results will be
as Kalee desires.

1669
02:11:14,958 --> 02:11:17,792
Then the whole system
will dance to his tune.

1670
02:11:18,125 --> 02:11:21,292
So we'll seize the containers. Go on.

1671
02:11:22,250 --> 02:11:23,500
- Okay?
- Okay.

1672
02:11:23,833 --> 02:11:25,458
Father and I will do the job together.

1673
02:11:25,708 --> 02:11:26,708
What about us?

1674
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:34,250
My younger brother
was like a son to me.

1675
02:11:38,458 --> 02:11:39,708
Did Irani call?

1676
02:11:39,958 --> 02:11:40,958
No, sir.

1677
02:11:57,458 --> 02:11:58,458
Murad!

1678
02:12:01,250 --> 02:12:03,625
Tell Father he won't be coming
with us, Helana.

1679
02:12:04,125 --> 02:12:06,500
Uncle, Chief has asked you to wait here.

1680
02:12:07,250 --> 02:12:08,250
We'll handle it.

1681
02:12:08,458 --> 02:12:12,667
If we need you, we'll call.
But we won't be needing you.

1682
02:12:13,125 --> 02:12:14,125
Okay, uncle?

1683
02:12:15,042 --> 02:12:16,500
Juju, she called you "uncle"!

1684
02:12:33,750 --> 02:12:35,917
Shit! No wait! No!

1685
02:12:40,083 --> 02:12:41,083
Shit!

1686
02:13:51,958 --> 02:13:53,458
Chief!

1687
02:13:57,167 --> 02:13:58,167
Helana.

1688
02:14:31,292 --> 02:14:32,458
Whoo-hoo!

1689
02:15:43,625 --> 02:15:45,417
- Eeram, come in.
- Okay, Chief.

1690
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:48,125
Faster, faster.

1691
02:15:49,208 --> 02:15:50,583
No, Chief. No, Chief.

1692
02:16:09,542 --> 02:16:10,625
Father, what are you...

1693
02:16:44,708 --> 02:16:45,708
What the…

1694
02:17:04,958 --> 02:17:07,125
- All good, my son? You managed well.
- Father…

1695
02:17:07,667 --> 02:17:08,667
What the...

1696
02:17:12,417 --> 02:17:15,500
- Go, we old folk can handle them.
- Father, I won't leave you…

1697
02:17:15,583 --> 02:17:18,292
Your mission is more important. Go!

1698
02:17:58,833 --> 02:17:59,833
Turn right!

1699
02:18:23,083 --> 02:18:25,000
<i>Sir, Azad has been caught.</i>

1700
02:18:27,292 --> 02:18:28,833
Chief…

1701
02:18:30,167 --> 02:18:31,167
Chief.

1702
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:35,500
Chief.

1703
02:18:37,250 --> 02:18:38,250
My son.

1704
02:18:39,917 --> 02:18:40,792
Chief.

1705
02:18:40,875 --> 02:18:42,500
Your mission is more important.

1706
02:18:42,583 --> 02:18:43,583
Go.

1707
02:18:43,625 --> 02:18:44,625
Chief!

1708
02:18:45,500 --> 02:18:47,167
- Good to go.
- Yeah, yeah.

1709
02:19:06,625 --> 02:19:08,167
- Sir.
- What?

1710
02:19:08,417 --> 02:19:09,417
The TV news…

1711
02:19:15,917 --> 02:19:17,125
VIKRAM RATHORE LIVE AGAIN

1712
02:19:17,875 --> 02:19:20,125
WILL THE NEW ROBIN HOOD
BRING ABOUT ANOTHER CHANGE?

1713
02:19:23,375 --> 02:19:24,500
- Is it live?
- Yes, sir.

1714
02:19:25,125 --> 02:19:28,042
<i>You all know me as Vikram Rathore.</i>

1715
02:19:28,125 --> 02:19:30,500
Hey, guys!
It's Vikram Rathore again!

1716
02:19:30,917 --> 02:19:31,917
He's live!

1717
02:19:32,792 --> 02:19:36,500
The Belamvada Women's Jail
is under my control.

1718
02:19:36,583 --> 02:19:40,083
<i>The lives of its 6000 inmates
are in my hands.</i>

1719
02:19:40,833 --> 02:19:44,708
<i>I'll be back at ten o'clock
to announce my demand.</i>

1720
02:19:45,667 --> 02:19:46,583
<i>Live!</i>

1721
02:19:46,667 --> 02:19:51,083
<i>By then I hope an ace negotiator
is called.</i>

1722
02:19:51,208 --> 02:19:54,250
Impossible!
He's been in our custody all night.

1723
02:19:54,625 --> 02:19:56,500
How can he show up on TV
at 6:00 a.m.?

1724
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Are you a duplicate?

1725
02:19:59,375 --> 02:20:00,250
Later.

1726
02:20:00,333 --> 02:20:01,667
Later. Later.

1727
02:20:04,792 --> 02:20:05,952
How can you be in two places?

1728
02:20:08,958 --> 02:20:10,250
It was Simba on TV.

1729
02:20:11,125 --> 02:20:13,250
This is Mufasa.

1730
02:20:15,708 --> 02:20:16,583
What samosa?

1731
02:20:16,667 --> 02:20:19,875
The man you saw on TV
is the lion's son.

1732
02:20:22,917 --> 02:20:25,250
And he's the lion.

1733
02:20:27,250 --> 02:20:30,458
I killed you with my own hands.

1734
02:20:30,750 --> 02:20:33,542
Yes, but he wasn't in the mood
to die that day.

1735
02:20:33,750 --> 02:20:34,750
Shut up!

1736
02:20:35,792 --> 02:20:38,125
Not one or two, I fired five bullets.

1737
02:20:41,750 --> 02:20:44,125
He's the same Vikram Rathore.

1738
02:20:44,208 --> 02:20:46,167
He's lost his memory.

1739
02:20:46,292 --> 02:20:49,833
That's the reason
you're still alive, Kalee.

1740
02:21:02,125 --> 02:21:03,125
I get it!

1741
02:21:03,417 --> 02:21:04,333
I get it!

1742
02:21:04,417 --> 02:21:06,083
Stop!

1743
02:21:06,542 --> 02:21:07,542
Give me my pills.

1744
02:21:14,875 --> 02:21:15,875
Gone.

1745
02:21:16,750 --> 02:21:17,750
You're gone.

1746
02:21:19,458 --> 02:21:20,458
The red pill.

1747
02:21:21,333 --> 02:21:22,375
For you.

1748
02:21:23,542 --> 02:21:24,542
Open your mouth.

1749
02:21:34,875 --> 02:21:36,542
Stop pretending, Rathore!

1750
02:21:37,417 --> 02:21:38,500
Don't you know who I am?

1751
02:21:39,083 --> 02:21:40,083
Hey!

1752
02:21:43,125 --> 02:21:44,125
Who am I?

1753
02:21:45,250 --> 02:21:46,250
Who am I?

1754
02:21:47,292 --> 02:21:48,292
Who am I?

1755
02:21:54,417 --> 02:21:55,667
Santa Claus!

1756
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:01,000
No?

1757
02:22:07,542 --> 02:22:09,958
Santa Claus! Ho! Ho! Ho!

1758
02:22:10,333 --> 02:22:11,333
No?

1759
02:22:12,292 --> 02:22:14,292
I have a gift for everybody.

1760
02:22:15,333 --> 02:22:18,042
<i>To negotiate with Vikram Rathore,</i>

1761
02:22:18,125 --> 02:22:23,083
<i>the authorities have sent
Special Task Officer Madhavan Nayak.</i>

1762
02:22:23,167 --> 02:22:24,792
Mr. Nayak's arriving.

1763
02:22:24,875 --> 02:22:27,458
Madhavan Nayak?
Or Vikram Rathore?

1764
02:22:27,542 --> 02:22:29,000
Who'll be the stronger?

1765
02:22:30,042 --> 02:22:33,292
For News Aaj, Sonam reporting
from Belamvada jail.

1766
02:22:45,042 --> 02:22:46,500
- Sir, walkie.
- Sir!

1767
02:22:46,750 --> 02:22:48,792
- What?
- Nayak sir... Walkie...

1768
02:22:49,583 --> 02:22:53,000
<i>Not Nayak, the good citizen</i>

1769
02:22:53,083 --> 02:22:55,792
<i>I'm Khalnayak, the villain</i>

1770
02:22:58,333 --> 02:23:00,083
- SPT.
- Sir.

1771
02:23:01,500 --> 02:23:02,500
Alif, sir.

1772
02:23:02,708 --> 02:23:03,875
- Alif?
- Yes, sir.

1773
02:23:04,125 --> 02:23:06,792
My wife is a Malayali.

1774
02:23:07,042 --> 02:23:09,958
Today is an important day for Malayalis.

1775
02:23:10,458 --> 02:23:11,458
Onam.

1776
02:23:11,958 --> 02:23:15,625
I told my wife I'd be home
in time for lunch.

1777
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:19,083
I give you an hour.
How many men do you want?

1778
02:23:19,167 --> 02:23:21,417
- At least twenty-five, sir.
- Twenty-five?

1779
02:23:21,500 --> 02:23:22,500
Fifteen men will do, sir.

1780
02:23:26,375 --> 02:23:28,542
Take a hundred men, a hundred.

1781
02:23:28,667 --> 02:23:29,667
Boys.

1782
02:23:29,708 --> 02:23:34,042
Catch that damn old man.
Shoot him in the head.

1783
02:23:34,125 --> 02:23:35,000
Okay, sir.

1784
02:23:35,083 --> 02:23:37,208
The old man will not be on TV again.

1785
02:23:37,542 --> 02:23:39,917
We'll be on TV
with their dead bodies.

1786
02:23:44,333 --> 02:23:46,792
<i>Nayak took immediate action</i>

1787
02:23:46,875 --> 02:23:49,292
<i>and sent 100 commandos
storming into the jail.</i>

1788
02:23:49,542 --> 02:23:53,875
<i>It seems he does not believe
in negotiation, but action.</i>

1789
02:23:59,417 --> 02:24:00,417
Hands up!

1790
02:24:00,958 --> 02:24:01,958
Hands up!

1791
02:24:06,958 --> 02:24:09,208
I told you to call the press.

1792
02:24:09,375 --> 02:24:11,458
Let them show their dead bodies.

1793
02:24:11,542 --> 02:24:13,458
I'm joining my wife for Onam lunch.

1794
02:24:13,875 --> 02:24:14,875
Sir.

1795
02:24:16,042 --> 02:24:17,042
Sir…

1796
02:24:22,375 --> 02:24:23,375
Sir.

1797
02:24:26,375 --> 02:24:27,375
Sir.

1798
02:24:28,375 --> 02:24:29,375
Sir.

1799
02:24:34,250 --> 02:24:35,250
Hands down.

1800
02:24:35,875 --> 02:24:36,875
Where are your pants?

1801
02:24:38,875 --> 02:24:42,167
Where are the girls?
Call them.

1802
02:24:42,792 --> 02:24:43,792
Girls!

1803
02:25:03,792 --> 02:25:05,458
It's not one man and six women,

1804
02:25:06,042 --> 02:25:08,625
it's one man and 6000 women, sir.

1805
02:25:09,292 --> 02:25:10,292
It's an army!

1806
02:25:18,750 --> 02:25:20,333
- Vikram said something else.
- What?

1807
02:25:20,792 --> 02:25:22,542
Stay ten feet away from the walls.

1808
02:25:22,875 --> 02:25:23,750
Why?

1809
02:25:23,833 --> 02:25:25,184
He's been the warden for 12 years,

1810
02:25:25,208 --> 02:25:28,292
and has planted landmines along
the boundary walls, sir.

1811
02:25:28,458 --> 02:25:31,000
He said our men risk
being blown to bits.

1812
02:25:51,500 --> 02:25:55,042
He's a good man.
He didn't lie just to scare us.

1813
02:25:56,042 --> 02:25:57,500
Pull back.

1814
02:25:59,958 --> 02:26:02,500
<i>Brother Vikram, any more demands?</i>

1815
02:26:02,708 --> 02:26:05,333
I've emailed you a copy
of an executive order.

1816
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,875
I need an Indian citizen's
signature on it.

1817
02:26:09,958 --> 02:26:12,042
Sure! I'm an Indian citizen.

1818
02:26:12,750 --> 02:26:15,458
Aadhar card, PAN, Voter ID,
I have the lot.

1819
02:26:15,542 --> 02:26:17,917
No, no. Not a citizen like you!

1820
02:26:19,208 --> 02:26:21,250
The honorable Head of State!

1821
02:26:22,958 --> 02:26:25,708
<i>The hijacker is demanding
the Head of State's signature.</i>

1822
02:26:25,792 --> 02:26:27,833
<i>This is not a good sign
for our democracy.</i>

1823
02:26:29,125 --> 02:26:30,500
What do you think, brother?

1824
02:26:30,875 --> 02:26:32,625
Will the government agree?

1825
02:26:32,708 --> 02:26:33,708
No way.

1826
02:26:33,750 --> 02:26:36,875
But I have something precious,

1827
02:26:37,083 --> 02:26:39,667
- so they'll agree.
- Meaning?

1828
02:26:39,792 --> 02:26:43,167
You know that thing?
It's broad, longish…

1829
02:26:43,292 --> 02:26:44,625
<i>Words can't describe it.</i>

1830
02:26:44,708 --> 02:26:47,167
I'll send two samples.

1831
02:26:47,417 --> 02:26:50,833
Look at them, then show them
to the world on TV.

1832
02:26:51,583 --> 02:26:54,417
Sniper! Anyone steps out,
shoot on sight.

1833
02:26:54,500 --> 02:26:55,500
- Copy, sir.
- Got it?

1834
02:27:14,542 --> 02:27:15,542
Sir, should I?

1835
02:27:25,750 --> 02:27:27,208
- Bomb squad!
<i>- Careful, boys.</i>

1836
02:27:28,708 --> 02:27:30,125
<i>Now let's try to open it.</i>

1837
02:27:32,208 --> 02:27:33,208
What's inside?

1838
02:27:33,417 --> 02:27:34,937
Father and I will do the job together.

1839
02:27:35,375 --> 02:27:36,375
What about us?

1840
02:27:38,458 --> 02:27:40,667
<i>Seize the government trucks.</i>

1841
02:27:41,292 --> 02:27:42,292
<i>They contain machines</i>

1842
02:27:42,542 --> 02:27:45,875
<i>that determine the fate
of 140 crore Indians.</i>

1843
02:27:55,375 --> 02:27:56,375
Hey!

1844
02:27:56,708 --> 02:27:58,583
Let the girls ride at the back.

1845
02:27:58,667 --> 02:27:59,667
Okay, sir.

1846
02:28:05,958 --> 02:28:08,250
Well? Is it boy or a girl?

1847
02:28:09,792 --> 02:28:10,792
- A gun.
- A gun.

1848
02:28:14,375 --> 02:28:18,042
There's no money in this truck.
Nothing of any value.

1849
02:28:18,750 --> 02:28:20,042
We know.

1850
02:28:21,458 --> 02:28:23,333
You have what we want.

1851
02:28:23,417 --> 02:28:24,417
What's inside?

1852
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,083
Sir, voting machines.

1853
02:28:43,625 --> 02:28:45,167
They've taken the voting machines.

1854
02:28:45,333 --> 02:28:46,625
If the elections are delayed,

1855
02:28:46,708 --> 02:28:48,958
the economy and democracy
will be endangered.

1856
02:28:49,042 --> 02:28:51,250
Nine lakh voting machines
have disappeared.

1857
02:28:51,583 --> 02:28:55,292
They say 9,00,000 machines!
It must be ten times that.

1858
02:28:55,375 --> 02:28:56,976
Why can't they make new voting machines?

1859
02:28:57,583 --> 02:28:59,250
By the time new machines are ready…

1860
02:28:59,667 --> 02:29:02,917
…your son will be old enough to vote.

1861
02:29:04,875 --> 02:29:09,708
They're demanding we close 53 factories
in exchange for the voting machines.

1862
02:29:09,958 --> 02:29:13,083
Forty thousand cases are pending
against these factories.

1863
02:29:13,167 --> 02:29:15,458
They've caused the death
of 40 lakh people.

1864
02:29:15,542 --> 02:29:16,542
What shall we do?

1865
02:29:16,708 --> 02:29:18,083
Refuse his demands.

1866
02:29:19,083 --> 02:29:20,583
- Sir, it's terrorism.
- Exactly.

1867
02:29:20,708 --> 02:29:22,917
Their acts aren't terrorism,

1868
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,625
but ours are.

1869
02:29:25,333 --> 02:29:28,750
The surrounding areas have been
badly polluted by these factories.

1870
02:29:28,833 --> 02:29:30,458
Accidents and deaths are commonplace.

1871
02:29:30,542 --> 02:29:31,958
All rules have been flouted.

1872
02:29:32,042 --> 02:29:35,542
If we don't want another disaster
like the Bhopal tragedy,

1873
02:29:35,792 --> 02:29:37,625
we must close factories.

1874
02:29:37,708 --> 02:29:39,208
You want me to agree to his demands?

1875
02:29:39,333 --> 02:29:42,833
Yes, sir. His means are wrong,
but his demands are right.

1876
02:29:46,833 --> 02:29:48,583
Whenever anyone is blackmailed,

1877
02:29:50,125 --> 02:29:52,542
unreasonable demands are made.

1878
02:29:54,250 --> 02:29:55,542
But it's the first time

1879
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:59,208
someone is forcing us
to do the right thing.

1880
02:30:00,042 --> 02:30:01,083
It's a wake-up call.

1881
02:30:06,583 --> 02:30:08,083
Wait a minute! Wait!

1882
02:30:08,625 --> 02:30:11,917
This is the list of people
who'll seal the factories.

1883
02:30:13,667 --> 02:30:14,667
Mariamma!

1884
02:30:27,667 --> 02:30:30,027
<i>The government has closed
many factories around the country.</i>

1885
02:30:33,042 --> 02:30:36,125
Kalee, you couldn't save
your 13 factories.

1886
02:30:36,292 --> 02:30:39,500
Now how will you open new factories
as per your promise.

1887
02:30:39,583 --> 02:30:41,083
Yeah, this is a minor setback.

1888
02:30:41,792 --> 02:30:43,809
- I'll bounce back. Don't worry.
- We're not worried.

1889
02:30:43,833 --> 02:30:45,167
You need to worry.

1890
02:30:45,250 --> 02:30:49,083
'Cause whatever you've heard of me,
it's true, Kalee!

1891
02:31:01,125 --> 02:31:02,667
Don't tell him, Vikram.

1892
02:31:05,167 --> 02:31:06,167
Hey!

1893
02:31:06,417 --> 02:31:08,375
How do we get inside the jail?

1894
02:31:09,250 --> 02:31:10,250
Tell me.

1895
02:31:14,083 --> 02:31:16,417
Send the voting machines out.

1896
02:31:16,500 --> 02:31:17,900
<i>They're on their way, Mr. Madhavan.</i>

1897
02:31:18,167 --> 02:31:20,167
Before that,
I have one final demand.

1898
02:31:20,250 --> 02:31:21,292
Another demand?

1899
02:31:21,375 --> 02:31:23,250
<i>I address this demand
not to the system,</i>

1900
02:31:23,542 --> 02:31:25,250
but straight to the people.

1901
02:31:25,333 --> 02:31:27,250
- <i>To you all.</i>
- Sir!

1902
02:31:36,125 --> 02:31:38,125
I am not Vikram Rathore.

1903
02:31:42,500 --> 02:31:44,917
<i>So who am I? I don't know.</i>

1904
02:31:46,208 --> 02:31:50,125
Am I a promise made to my mother?
Or an incomplete intent?

1905
02:31:50,417 --> 02:31:52,667
Did I do wrong or right?
Don't know.

1906
02:31:55,042 --> 02:31:57,542
My father was branded a traitor.

1907
02:31:58,167 --> 02:32:01,125
My aim has always been to clear his name.

1908
02:32:01,708 --> 02:32:04,208
I've worn many faces to seek the truth.

1909
02:32:06,083 --> 02:32:08,250
Am I good? Or bad?

1910
02:32:09,917 --> 02:32:11,125
A blessing?

1911
02:32:11,542 --> 02:32:12,542
<i>Or a curse?</i>

1912
02:32:13,500 --> 02:32:14,750
Ask yourself.

1913
02:32:15,167 --> 02:32:16,167
Because I am…

1914
02:32:18,375 --> 02:32:19,375
you.

1915
02:32:19,833 --> 02:32:23,125
Here's my last and most important demand.

1916
02:32:23,917 --> 02:32:24,917
Just one.

1917
02:32:25,833 --> 02:32:28,292
I'm talking about your habits.

1918
02:32:28,917 --> 02:32:31,792
You have this habit
of questioning everything.

1919
02:32:32,042 --> 02:32:35,583
When you buy your groceries,
you question what you buy.

1920
02:32:36,250 --> 02:32:38,167
Is this flour pure?

1921
02:32:38,250 --> 02:32:39,708
Are there stones in the rice?

1922
02:32:39,917 --> 02:32:41,750
Does this soap lather well?

1923
02:32:42,167 --> 02:32:44,458
If you buy a motorbike,
you ask about the mileage.

1924
02:32:44,875 --> 02:32:46,958
<i>Is the after-sales service good?</i>

1925
02:32:47,375 --> 02:32:50,958
<i>Even when you buy a simple pen…
you fuss over nothing.</i>

1926
02:32:51,042 --> 02:32:54,875
You question each and every thing
all the time!

1927
02:32:55,167 --> 02:32:56,167
<i>Except for one thing.</i>

1928
02:32:57,667 --> 02:32:59,417
When you chose your government.

1929
02:33:01,292 --> 02:33:02,292
Five hours!

1930
02:33:03,083 --> 02:33:06,750
You ask so many questions about
a mosquito coil that lasts five hours.

1931
02:33:07,375 --> 02:33:10,333
Does it give off too much smoke?
Or smell bad?

1932
02:33:10,792 --> 02:33:12,500
Will it kill mosquitoes?

1933
02:33:13,958 --> 02:33:18,375
But when you choose a government
for five years,

1934
02:33:19,083 --> 02:33:20,167
you ask no questions.

1935
02:33:20,333 --> 02:33:22,000
You ask nothing at all.

1936
02:33:24,792 --> 02:33:25,792
And that's why…

1937
02:33:27,042 --> 02:33:29,500
my demand is that you question
your choice.

1938
02:33:31,167 --> 02:33:33,667
Don't vote because of your fears,
or what they pay you,

1939
02:33:33,750 --> 02:33:35,833
or on the basis of caste,
religion or community.

1940
02:33:35,917 --> 02:33:38,833
Question the people
who seek your vote.

1941
02:33:39,708 --> 02:33:42,583
Ask what they'll do for us
in the next five years.

1942
02:33:45,125 --> 02:33:47,083
What about my children's education?

1943
02:33:47,917 --> 02:33:49,750
How will they help me get a job?

1944
02:33:50,458 --> 02:33:52,500
If I fall sick, what happens to my family?

1945
02:33:52,583 --> 02:33:57,208
How will they advance our country
in the next five years?

1946
02:33:57,292 --> 02:33:58,292
<i>Ask…</i>

1947
02:33:58,375 --> 02:33:59,417
<i>before you vote.</i>

1948
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:02,583
The finger that you use to vote,

1949
02:34:03,958 --> 02:34:06,250
point it at them and ask questions.

1950
02:34:06,375 --> 02:34:07,583
If you did that,

1951
02:34:09,167 --> 02:34:11,833
our health system would improve.

1952
02:34:12,042 --> 02:34:13,292
To help poor farmers,

1953
02:34:13,375 --> 02:34:16,000
you won't need a Vikram Rathore
or an Azad.

1954
02:34:16,417 --> 02:34:17,737
Because your vote will be enough.

1955
02:34:19,042 --> 02:34:21,625
You have power at your fingertips.

1956
02:34:21,833 --> 02:34:24,500
Know who'll gain freedom
if you fulfill my demand?

1957
02:34:24,875 --> 02:34:25,875
You.

1958
02:34:26,208 --> 02:34:27,208
<i>You.</i>

1959
02:34:27,250 --> 02:34:28,125
<i>You.</i>

1960
02:34:28,208 --> 02:34:29,458
All of you.

1961
02:34:29,792 --> 02:34:31,083
<i>Freedom from poverty.</i>

1962
02:34:31,458 --> 02:34:34,042
Freedom from injustice.
Freedom from corruption.

1963
02:34:34,833 --> 02:34:37,917
Trust in your finger.

1964
02:34:38,542 --> 02:34:39,583
Make use of it.

1965
02:34:40,833 --> 02:34:41,833
That's all.

1966
02:34:43,750 --> 02:34:44,750
Jai Hind!

1967
02:34:46,042 --> 02:34:47,042
What a man!

1968
02:34:51,083 --> 02:34:52,167
Mr. Madhavan,

1969
02:34:52,875 --> 02:34:54,542
I'm sending you all the
voting machines.

1970
02:34:54,833 --> 02:34:57,083
Every ten minutes,
a container will reach you.

1971
02:34:57,833 --> 02:34:58,833
And, Mr. Madhavan…

1972
02:34:59,583 --> 02:35:01,500
<i>- Happy Onam!</i>
- Happy Onam!

1973
02:35:07,500 --> 02:35:09,500
Iskra, have you tracked
my father's location?

1974
02:35:15,500 --> 02:35:16,792
- Azad.
- Uncle.

1975
02:35:18,875 --> 02:35:20,208
Forgive me, Azad.

1976
02:35:21,833 --> 02:35:23,208
- Uncle!
- Uncle!

1977
02:35:24,833 --> 02:35:27,708
Santa has come for you!

1978
02:35:28,167 --> 02:35:30,708
And he has a gift for you.

1979
02:35:34,500 --> 02:35:36,375
Girls! Guns down.

1980
02:35:38,833 --> 02:35:39,958
Hey!

1981
02:35:44,583 --> 02:35:46,167
You killed my brother.

1982
02:35:47,083 --> 02:35:48,542
You killed my brother.

1983
02:35:50,333 --> 02:35:51,333
Give it.

1984
02:35:52,583 --> 02:35:53,583
Answer me!

1985
02:35:54,042 --> 02:35:55,042
Where's my money?

1986
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:57,208
Where is it?

1987
02:35:58,125 --> 02:35:59,125
Where's my money?

1988
02:36:01,292 --> 02:36:04,667
You take my money and give it away!

1989
02:36:05,042 --> 02:36:06,708
What did you think was gonna happen?

1990
02:36:07,958 --> 02:36:09,208
Don't you feel any pain?

1991
02:36:12,667 --> 02:36:14,875
- And you?
- Yes, it hurts.

1992
02:36:15,500 --> 02:36:16,625
Now you'll hurt.

1993
02:36:19,292 --> 02:36:20,292
Kalee, no.

1994
02:36:20,958 --> 02:36:21,958
Does it hurt?

1995
02:36:22,625 --> 02:36:24,208
- It will!
- Father!

1996
02:36:24,333 --> 02:36:25,750
Father! Tell me!

1997
02:36:25,917 --> 02:36:27,333
Where's my money, Father?

1998
02:36:27,417 --> 02:36:28,417
Hey, Kalee!

1999
02:36:28,500 --> 02:36:29,750
Talk to me, Father.

2000
02:36:30,333 --> 02:36:31,625
Talk to me, Father.

2001
02:36:31,708 --> 02:36:32,583
Father!

2002
02:36:32,667 --> 02:36:33,750
Tell me something.

2003
02:36:34,083 --> 02:36:36,875
I know sons who don't know
their fathers.

2004
02:36:37,417 --> 02:36:40,083
But a father who doesn't know
his son. How's that possible?

2005
02:36:40,792 --> 02:36:43,208
You don't know how I killed
your father, right?

2006
02:36:43,292 --> 02:36:44,292
I'll show how.

2007
02:36:45,542 --> 02:36:46,583
Just for you.

2008
02:36:48,542 --> 02:36:49,625
Once more.

2009
02:36:51,333 --> 02:36:52,667
No!

2010
02:36:54,292 --> 02:36:55,292
Kalee, no.

2011
02:36:59,583 --> 02:37:00,750
Father!

2012
02:37:07,875 --> 02:37:09,125
Kalee, please! Kalee!

2013
02:37:10,583 --> 02:37:13,083
Everything started here.
It's come full circle.

2014
02:37:25,042 --> 02:37:26,042
Let's count.

2015
02:37:27,083 --> 02:37:28,083
One…

2016
02:37:28,333 --> 02:37:29,917
two, three.

2017
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:41,333
Now I get it.

2018
02:37:42,750 --> 02:37:44,083
When my company's gun

2019
02:37:44,167 --> 02:37:46,500
doesn't work on time…
I know how it feels.

2020
02:37:49,167 --> 02:37:50,167
What?

2021
02:37:53,625 --> 02:37:54,833
It's not working, Kalee!

2022
02:37:54,917 --> 02:37:55,917
Right.

2023
02:37:56,542 --> 02:37:58,708
He's not destined to die at your hands.

2024
02:37:58,875 --> 02:38:01,125
Let's see what his destiny is.

2025
02:38:08,792 --> 02:38:09,792
Vikram.

2026
02:38:31,792 --> 02:38:33,875
Before you touch my son,

2027
02:38:34,500 --> 02:38:35,958
deal with his father.

2028
02:38:48,292 --> 02:38:49,458
Rathore!

2029
02:38:50,333 --> 02:38:52,042
Kalee!

2030
02:39:03,833 --> 02:39:05,000
My son.

2031
02:39:16,708 --> 02:39:18,250
Now you can kiss me.

2032
02:39:24,500 --> 02:39:25,583
My son.

2033
02:39:25,667 --> 02:39:27,625
What a scene!

2034
02:39:28,083 --> 02:39:29,083
I'm moved!

2035
02:39:29,792 --> 02:39:33,333
Shoot them before they sing
an emotional song.

2036
02:39:33,417 --> 02:39:34,417
Finish them off.

2037
02:39:53,750 --> 02:39:54,750
Careful!

2038
02:40:02,958 --> 02:40:05,125
- Gun, my son.
- Father.

2039
02:40:09,500 --> 02:40:10,500
Azad.

2040
02:40:11,667 --> 02:40:12,667
Here.

2041
02:41:49,792 --> 02:41:50,792
Bahubali?

2042
02:41:55,667 --> 02:41:56,667
Sir.

2043
02:42:09,542 --> 02:42:12,250
Bahubali, put me down!

2044
02:42:32,333 --> 02:42:33,917
Father, what now?

2045
02:42:35,083 --> 02:42:36,125
Tackle him for a minute.

2046
02:42:36,292 --> 02:42:37,792
- Okay.
- I'll think of an idea.

2047
02:42:38,333 --> 02:42:39,333
Okay!

2048
02:42:40,042 --> 02:42:41,042
Your idea?

2049
02:42:54,667 --> 02:42:55,667
Hey!

2050
02:43:16,875 --> 02:43:17,875
Hey!

2051
02:43:18,542 --> 02:43:20,708
The process of hanging
is very interesting.

2052
02:43:21,542 --> 02:43:23,375
One jerk, one snap.

2053
02:43:24,292 --> 02:43:25,292
Right?

2054
02:43:31,750 --> 02:43:34,333
Tie the noose tightly round the neck.

2055
02:43:37,208 --> 02:43:39,458
Your eyes will pop out.

2056
02:43:41,750 --> 02:43:43,042
Your tongue will hang out…

2057
02:43:57,042 --> 02:43:58,042
Rathore!

2058
02:43:59,667 --> 02:44:02,167
Don't go crazy in your lust for revenge.

2059
02:44:02,958 --> 02:44:04,000
Let's make a deal.

2060
02:44:04,500 --> 02:44:06,167
Let's make a deal, Rathore.

2061
02:44:06,417 --> 02:44:09,333
Kalee, no!

2062
02:44:09,875 --> 02:44:10,958
No deal.

2063
02:44:11,083 --> 02:44:12,917
Let's make a deal, Rathore.

2064
02:44:13,292 --> 02:44:14,542
Good to go, girls?

2065
02:44:17,417 --> 02:44:18,417
Girls, no!

2066
02:44:18,542 --> 02:44:21,542
Rathore, let's make a deal.

2067
02:44:22,042 --> 02:44:23,042
Girls, wait!

2068
02:44:23,125 --> 02:44:24,958
Let's make a deal, Rathore.

2069
02:44:26,250 --> 02:44:27,292
Rathore, let's make a...

2070
02:44:27,500 --> 02:44:29,667
Rathore!

2071
02:44:39,292 --> 02:44:40,292
Don't worry.

2072
02:44:41,083 --> 02:44:42,542
Now you'll sleep well.

2073
02:44:43,875 --> 02:44:44,875
I love you.

2074
02:44:44,917 --> 02:44:45,917
<i>Love you, Vikram.</i>

2075
02:44:52,625 --> 02:44:54,726
We backed you all along!
And what the hell did you do?!

2076
02:44:54,750 --> 02:44:57,167
How long, Mr. Nayak?!
Answer me!

2077
02:45:00,542 --> 02:45:01,708
I'm on it…

2078
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:04,125
ma'am.

2079
02:45:40,708 --> 02:45:41,708
Buddy!

2080
02:45:43,958 --> 02:45:45,250
Yes, coming, coming.

2081
02:46:24,125 --> 02:46:25,125
Good to see you, sir.

2082
02:46:26,625 --> 02:46:27,792
Your next mission.

2083
02:46:28,417 --> 02:46:29,500
Swiss bank.

2084
02:46:31,375 --> 02:46:32,375
Papa?

2085
02:46:32,917 --> 02:46:33,917
Coming.

2086
02:46:34,167 --> 02:46:35,167
You go.

2087
02:46:36,625 --> 02:46:38,667
The factory guys have received the money.

2088
02:47:01,167 --> 02:47:02,167
Father!

2089
02:47:08,833 --> 02:47:11,042
Enough rest.
We must get back to work.

2090
02:47:11,125 --> 02:47:12,000
Work.

2091
02:47:12,083 --> 02:47:13,083
Work! Come.

2092
02:47:13,417 --> 02:47:15,583
All work and no joy

2093
02:47:15,708 --> 02:47:18,083
will make Handsome a dull boy.

2094
02:47:20,583 --> 02:47:21,583
Hey!

2095
02:47:22,417 --> 02:47:23,417
Music!
