1
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,738
The whole country of the system is that
I am not in this movie

2
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,281
only my name is in this movie
"Bachchan"

3
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:13,889
Whatever they are saying

4
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:15,296
they are lying

5
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,427
I can swear on Geeta

6
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,936
That's the first dialogue of play

7
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,138
and where is Geeta?

8
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,203
And where is the Gandhi Ji's picture
behind the chair

9
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,477
How long I should wait?

10
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,845
You are busy to make over this court

11
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,681
Tomorrow we have real hearing
in court

12
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:36,753
Where is your brother Abbas?

13
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:54,833
You also know how I am collecting
money for this case

14
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,443
I have sold my own taxi for this case
who is running from 3 years

15
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:00,209
And whom he sold his taxi

16
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,570
Now he is driving taxi for
those people

17
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,720
After dad's death our uncle
occupied our property

18
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,218
Now in which house we are living he
also wanted to occupy that house

19
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,055
If we will win this case

20
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,293
then we will keep our house

21
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,828
and we will be attached with
our dad's memories as well

22
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,935
Tomorrow's judgenment must be
in our favour

23
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,070
Don't worry!

24
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,076
We will must win

25
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,374
But you are telling this thing
since 3 years

26
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,173
I can give you guarantee

27
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,344
Now I have prepared the case

28
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,654
that your opponent won'tjust
give you the house but

29
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:46,119
they will give us compensation for
mental harrasement

30
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,583
Really?
Yes!

31
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,394
Judge is gonna be impressed with
my arguments

32
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,121
that he will say before judgement

33
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,301
All the Arguments of Abbas Ali's lawyer

34
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,831
and his given papers clearly tells

35
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,942
that this property doesn't
belongs to Abbas Ali

36
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,044
Now if he wants...

37
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,408
So he can file a case of Mental
Harrasement against Abbas Ali.

38
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,085
Where are you running?

39
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,492
Come here!

40
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,193
I am a lawyer

41
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,164
You are the last nail of grave

42
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,999
We will go to Supreme Court

43
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,872
Now you will go up

44
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:47,584
You have crossed the limits...

45
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,916
You have beaten your own lawyer
at government office

46
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,585
Thanks to Sania that he called me

47
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,318
and I have got bail for you

48
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,292
Otherwise! You didn't think about your
sister before doing it all

49
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,727
I have thought about Sania

50
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,765
that's why I have just beaten up
that bastard

51
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,636
Otherwise I would have kill him with
that Judge's hammer

52
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,440
I agreed that it all went wrong
with us

53
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,970
But it doesn't mean that you will
start kill everyone

54
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,076
What else I should do?

55
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,438
We have left this house

56
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,811
Junaid Bhai is refusing me to
give his taxi

57
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,383
he is saying that I am a criminal

58
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,187
In that case I won't lose my temper
then what else. Enough!

59
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,882
Sania!
Get some tea for him

60
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,001
Now I understand that...

61
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,197
Why Taj Mahal is a wonder

62
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:40,662
What?

63
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,808
Without getting loan from the bank

64
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,639
Shah Jehan has build up Taj Mahal

65
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,148
Wonder!

66
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:56,279
A middle class man have so many
basic wishes

67
00:10:58,524 --> 00:10:59,821
6 figure salary

68
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:01,852
5 working days

69
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,622
4 wheeler car

70
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:06,829
2 bedroom flat

71
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,064
two kids and...

72
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,331
a life partner

73
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,695
But the reality is that...

74
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:17,098
In this world man's heavy burden

75
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,736
is his empty pockets...

76
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,873
Appreciation of good days comes
after bad days...

77
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,884
Thanks to confirm this thing that...

78
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,184
I am running on my bad days

79
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,729
It's good to understand your situation

80
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,594
But it's a bad thing to curse
on your situations...

81
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,333
You and Sania come with me
to my village

82
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,739
Me and your dad wasn't friends
for the namesake

83
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:53,806
we were like brothers...

84
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,648
Now you will do like I will say

85
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:02,051
If you'll stay here then you'll cursse
your luck to see those faces

86
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,184
And I will try

87
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,620
where I works you will get a
nice job there

88
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,126
Rananpur is such a wonderfull place

89
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:14,922
No politics is there

90
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,562
Nor crowd like city

91
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,005
Peace is all over the village

92
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,509
I have been working for Raghuwanshi
family from 30 years

93
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,503
Earlier with his father

94
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,040
and now I am working with his
son PrithviRaj...

95
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,879
PrithviRaj is such an amazing man

96
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,051
He have only two habits

97
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:10,251
First!

98
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,888
His second is speaking better english
than British people

99
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,411
More than English

100
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,052
He loves his sister Radhika

101
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,149
Right now Radhika is studying
in Dehli

102
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,890
whenever the matter comes for
Rananpur's village progress

103
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,160
PrithviRaj stands first of all...

104
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:53,928
This year in village

105
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,836
He is also starting the power plant
project in village

106
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:04,274
But his cousin Vikrant comes to
interfere in power plant project

107
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:08,576
To provoke the family enimty

108
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,354
He is against Prithviraj and
this Power Project

109
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,084
PrithviRaj looks such a honest
and decent man

110
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,292
You have decided to put Abbas
job on right place

111
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,725
He hates only one thing

112
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:28,966
What?

113
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:30,432
Lie!

114
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,104
How do you feeling?
I am feeling lot of pain

115
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,405
Have some water

116
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,469
Help!

117
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,405
He brought you here

118
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,842
Tell me which monster
turned you in this condition

119
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,319
I did it...

120
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,278
I have beaten him up

121
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:51,588
You have beaten him up and
you brought him here

122
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,118
He had lot of stains on his body

123
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,761
It was necessary to wash him

124
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,528
And to bringing him up here

125
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,899
was necessary for humanity

126
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:04,730
But what he has done?
He has done fraud!

127
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:11,008
He has done a fraud of 99 rupees
in accounts

128
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:14,471
Only for rupees 99...
It's not a matter of 99

129
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:16,641
It's a matter of lie

130
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,080
Prithiviraj salutes the truth

131
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,690
but he killed the lier

132
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:54,275
Next time if you will lie then
don't worry about the results

133
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,016
I will give you the prize

134
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,551
Find another man of his replacement

135
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,828
This Ravi is late again

136
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,023
he is not my son but my problem

137
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,595
He is the proof of my every disease

138
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,432
There must be some reason for late
Only one reason

139
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,274
His third class Aflatton Drama Company

140
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,153
My friend Abbas you have come

141
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,152
I have come to dehli many times

142
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:40,290
but you are welcome first time
in our village

143
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,995
Actually we came here to meet you
without changing our costumes

144
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,932
But you guys are late

145
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,572
I am standing here since long
because of you

146
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,901
Are you the coin of Sholay that you
have to stand since long

147
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,006
You could sit on the bench

148
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,439
Shame on you!

149
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,411
Show some manners of the act
of this Lord Raam

150
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:00,909
You are calling your dad from
his name

151
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,586
It depends on the father

152
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,192
Shastri!
Pick up the bags

153
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,160
Your drama company is really Aflatoon

154
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,741
I was saying now you have come here

155
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,782
So why don't you make over our
drama company's stage

156
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,417
Where else we will find a better
Art Director like you

157
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,751
At lease some intelligent came
to Joker Party

158
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,624
Tell me the theme of your new play

159
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,902
I will have to decide the things
for your play

160
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,899
People makes movies to inspire
from the play

161
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,168
but first time

162
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,445
I have made this play to inspire
with movies

163
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,781
What's the name of your play?

164
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,221
What else we can expect people
like you

165
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,854
You are good for nothing

166
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,363
We can't rehearse our play
because of him

167
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:31,370
One minute!

168
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,743
You are Shastri and he is Ravi

169
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,577
If not here then where do you
rehearse for your play

170
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:48,021
My dad used to say that human should
respect his moustache and his principles

171
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,938
Who doesn't have moustache he
doesn't have heart

172
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,676
By the way where is your dad?

173
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:14,009
He died four years ago

174
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:15,482
Good!

175
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,291
What an acting?

176
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,458
Your play is super hit

177
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,528
Abbas! I want you to pray the God

178
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,030
like my first act has come

179
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,297
Alibaba and 15 thieves

180
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,004
same as that this act should
be successful

181
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:35,966
15 thieves?

182
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,337
Alibaba had 40 thieves

183
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,340
It's a play for village

184
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,245
We have problem for budget

185
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,416
that's why Alibaba and 15 thieves

186
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,716
I have made the list of all things

187
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,549
You take Sania to Pichku's shop

188
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,053
and take credit

189
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,988
Actually we have a budget problem

190
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,753
Get down!

191
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,223
You will fall down

192
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,504
What are you doing up there?
Get down!

193
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,274
Get down!
You will fall down!

194
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,646
Why temple is closed?

195
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,646
Abbas! This temple is at the boudary
of Ranantpur and Kherwara

196
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,382
See the result of two villages fight

197
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,515
Temple door is locked from many years

198
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,012
What are you doing?
Are you gone mad?

199
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,518
If you will enter the temple then
there will be a chaos

200
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,132
What you have done?

201
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,695
You have broken the temple's lock

202
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,097
Kid would sink down...
But!

203
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,739
Let's go from here

204
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,313
Who are you?

205
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,457
You are out of my mind

206
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,155
Where smoke doesn't appear...

207
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,627
Your dish get hot over there...

208
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,525
You don't interefere!

209
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:28,505
We already had many arguments
on this issue

210
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:30,569
You are shooting in the day

211
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,499
We have already warned you

212
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:35,705
You could be arrested for your act

213
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,912
But this guy has broken temple's lock

214
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,745
This guy has broken the temple's lock
to save this kid

215
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:44,879
I think that's the God wish

216
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:49,425
Now it will be against the religion
to lock down this temple

217
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,262
So what do you mean?

218
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,160
If temple is open so it will
remain open

219
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,834
I will take the permission
from Collector

220
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,332
If anybody will go against
this decision

221
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,469
then he would be arrested

222
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,267
I don't accept this decision...

223
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:04,966
S. P!
This temple will remain open

224
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,637
From today it's my responsibility

225
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,109
and if whoever will interfere

226
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,708
I will make him remember his
mom's milk

227
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,448
I have never seen you before...

228
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,381
He is my friend's son

229
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,191
He came from Dehli!

230
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:57,519
Name?

231
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,856
Abhishek Bachchan

232
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,863
His name is Abhishek Bachchan

233
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,927
What else I would say

234
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,232
Abbas Ali!

235
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,832
If villagers would know that Abbas
Ali has broken the temple's lock

236
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,940
then we all will be disappeared

237
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,700
But Abhishek Bachchan!

238
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:51,173
If Prithviraj will know this...

239
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:02,718
Come with me

240
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,528
He is the guy whom you wanted
to give job

241
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:45,727
Yes!

242
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,503
But you didn't tell me some
other name...

243
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:54,946
Who kept your name?

244
00:26:58,483 --> 00:26:59,848
His dad...

245
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,742
But why Abhishek Bachchan?

246
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,388
Why not Sachin Tendulkar

247
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,284
Because when he born he was
taller than Tendulkar

248
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:14,559
I am joking

249
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,360
Why are you shying Abhishek?

250
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:23,632
Tell him how did you
get this name

251
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:31,442
My dad and mom was the huge
fan of Amitabh Bachchan...

252
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:37,779
So!

253
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:44,161
So mom and dad met in cinema

254
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:45,728
they both were gone to watch Deewar

255
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,462
They saw each other in interval

256
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,825
and they felt in love

257
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:50,862
Then?

258
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,065
Why are you shying?
Speak!

259
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:00,138
Next time...

260
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:03,009
they went to watch movie together

261
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,045
Chupke Chupke!

262
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:10,244
Then they took swear of marriage

263
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:11,719
that day Qasme Waade was released

264
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:13,456
when they got married then
Suhaag was released

265
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:17,217
and when mom gave good news
to my dad

266
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:18,994
then Parwarish was released

267
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,531
and when I was released
I mean when I was born

268
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,329
then Muqaddar Ka Siqandar was released

269
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:31,404
that's why my dad kept my name
Abhishek Bachchan

270
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,583
Thank God your family was not
the fan of Amjad Khan

271
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,293
Otherwise your name would be
Gabbar Singh

272
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,097
What is your Qualification?

273
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,026
Jamia Islamia University

274
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:02,137
Pandit Nehru College opposite
to that University

275
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:03,570
I have passed B. A from there

276
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,605
A. B has passed B.A.

277
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,408
He read 2 words and both wrong,
B.A.

278
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,476
Makhan!
Yes!

279
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,252
Give him the job of Superman

280
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,755
He is saying Supervisor

281
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,488
Salary 30,000

282
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:25,858
30,000!
35,000!

283
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,331
Not more!

284
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,699
Without any experience you gave
me a job

285
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,275
Our thirty years special appearance

286
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:49,781
You came here for his proposal

287
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,184
Truth is that...

288
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,288
He wants to say that I will
never let you down

289
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,154
Because my dad used to say...

290
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,702
I can't count your body parts

291
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:40,903
Don't look relationship's benefits but
their meanings

292
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,372
And remember one thing

293
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:46,713
If you will do it again

294
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:49,852
then I will kill you

295
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:59,618
Now do you understand why I
didn't let you go anywhere

296
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:02,155
They are our kins but they are
thirsty for our blood

297
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,059
If he have so many problems here

298
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:07,098
then why don't we shift
from Ranantpur

299
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:09,398
Ranantpur's every villager is more
than my relatives

300
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:11,473
They have some hopes with me

301
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,671
and I have learned only one thing

302
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,369
Rather break your relationship

303
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,079
but never break anyone's trust

304
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:22,316
Next time if you want to
go somewhere

305
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:23,414
then inform me first

306
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:27,580
Seve the food!

307
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:32,991
We are leaving!

308
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:36,458
Listen!

309
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,196
Today you have prooved

310
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:42,738
that you are notjust honest

311
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:44,737
but you are brave too...

312
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:47,399
Come!

313
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:48,945
Have food with me

314
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:50,903
No!
Today I am fasting

315
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:56,309
From today I have decided that
I will fasting

316
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,363
Why fasting on wednesday?

317
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:16,732
Day doesn't matter for mom

318
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,803
I am fasting specially
for my mom

319
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:21,804
One minute!

320
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:26,714
You said that only your sister
lives with you

321
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,047
Now where did your mom
came from?

322
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,219
Only you can have mom I jumped
out from the egg

323
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:36,751
Actually! I had only sister at home

324
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:37,883
but mom also came yesterday

325
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:40,392
Where did your mom came from?
Kashi!

326
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:44,967
That's why...

327
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:50,804
that's why I have decided that mom
wouldn't be well

328
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:53,106
I will fasting everyday

329
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,908
I will also fasting for your mom

330
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:01,848
What are you saying?

331
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:04,510
You will do so much for mom...
It's not enough

332
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,622
Tomorrow I will come
to your house

333
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,314
No!
Yes! Why?

334
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:12,659
Why not?

335
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,130
But why?

336
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,924
I will open my fast with your mom

337
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,731
Mom and Sister will be very happy

338
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:25,403
I will be also happy

339
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,904
I will be also happy

340
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:29,279
Actually! Boss has seen the mom

341
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,808
but he haven't seen mom's love,
Makhan!

342
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:39,685
I didn't said listen!

343
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:43,149
I think your ears are not well...

344
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:02,943
How he will meet your mom?

345
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:03,602
If mom will exist then
he will meet

346
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:06,676
Where is your mom?

347
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,245
How would you bring the mom?

348
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:10,682
I think dad will passed away
for mom

349
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,887
We have fake mom in our play

350
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:17,284
Abbas!
Fake mom!

351
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,191
But how we will get fake mom?

352
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,327
We made Vidhya Sagar to play
girl's role

353
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:29,170
He will looks like mom

354
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:31,502
But I will never looks like his son

355
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:37,945
I have mom!

356
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:39,642
You have started again!

357
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:42,875
Stop narrating dialogues,
I am telling the truth

358
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:44,515
I have mom!

359
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:10,539
Look over there!

360
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,681
Your upcoming mom!

361
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,682
She!
Yes!

362
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:40,402
I need mom!

363
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:43,437
If she will start dancing in
front of Prithvi then...

364
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:44,940
She is an artist

365
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,583
And artists are like water

366
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:15,235
We will write down her dialogues
from Vidhya Sagar

367
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:42,196
It's good to being orphan,
Let's go! No!

368
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:43,771
Think about it!

369
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:44,969
4 minutes mom

370
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:46,501
orjob of 35,000

371
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,075
Sister's responsibility or unemployment

372
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:52,078
Mom's scarf or Prithivi's punch!

373
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:58,086
Tell me what do you want?

374
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,887
I have come to make you mom

375
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:04,624
What?

376
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:09,389
I have come to make you mom

377
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,564
You too?

378
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:14,803
Ravi was saying that you are
expert in this thing

379
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:17,197
Don't refuse us...

380
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:18,901
You are famous in this job

381
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:20,504
We have many expectations
from you

382
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:38,723
You have some mis-understanding

383
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:41,729
You have to act to being his mom
in front of his boss

384
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,866
She thinks that we are lusty men

385
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:50,665
Listen the problem!

386
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:54,701
Your story's emotion is right

387
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,838
but it's wrong to make me mom

388
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:00,313
Your Boss will catch me
in 2 minutes

389
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,645
No!
He is not so lusty

390
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:05,450
Not like this catching...

391
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,287
He will catch our lie

392
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:10,492
And he will know that I
am not a mom

393
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:13,392
Because I don't look like
mom's age

394
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,425
Make me your lover

395
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:20,334
Call me friend,
Younger sister is also fine but

396
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,438
Now my second act is starting
I am leaving

397
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:35,410
This old woman will die
in 2 days

398
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,180
She have my curse

399
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:41,520
But that monster will come
in 2 hours

400
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:43,348
What will we do?

401
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:46,894
Find a mom!

402
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:02,951
Not less than any challenge

403
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,645
Isn't it?

404
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:10,951
What are you thinking Abbas?

405
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:15,128
Prithvi came here to break his
fast with us

406
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:18,432
But how suddenly he is gone

407
01:02:25,641 --> 01:02:26,630
She is a ghost!

408
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:27,769
Not ghost!

409
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,540
She is Abhishek's sister Sania

410
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:35,748
She was Ameksha

411
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,418
My Ameksha

412
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:08,990
It will take time...

413
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:10,890
Eid's prayer will be over
in 5 minutes

414
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:12,725
Take your time
We are not in hurry!

415
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,796
You have done well to meet
Amirgarh's Collector

416
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:20,400
When Power Plant will start
in Ranantpur

417
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:22,571
then that you must see the
Vikrant's face

418
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:25,546
His face power will down

419
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:37,924
He is shooting in Amirgarh!

420
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,688
Not that one!
Our Abhishek from Ranantpur

421
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:42,392
Look over there!

422
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:36,276
Eid's sweet dish is really different

423
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:41,212
Have some!

424
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:44,391
Prithvi is here!

425
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,833
I have already told you rather
break the relationship

426
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:02,203
but don't break anyone's trust

427
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:05,413
I saw you in Amirgarh

428
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:08,742
You were hugging with everyone and
celebrating Eid

429
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:11,817
What's your reality?

430
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:14,248
Answer me!

431
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:26,528
You saw me in Amirgarh,

432
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,770
Now you need an answer

433
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:35,970
You wil give the answer

434
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:41,238
How would you give the answer in fact
you can't answer in your examination

435
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,352
I have an answer

436
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:56,360
Who you have seen that was me

437
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:57,788
but I wasn't that person

438
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,892
You were,
You were not!

439
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:03,071
That was my twin brother Abbas

440
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,474
Where are you going?

441
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:19,855
He is tolerating twin brothers
torture from the beginning

442
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:21,221
Since childhood

443
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:24,457
You tell him!

444
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,621
You know everything,
She is his sister

445
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:29,624
He stole mango from the tree

446
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:31,991
and he got beaten up

447
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:33,734
Dog came and bite him

448
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:35,700
and he got injections

449
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:39,199
He is my carbon copy

450
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:41,634
there is only the difference
of moustache

451
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:43,906
You didn't notice

452
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:46,172
I have moustache,
But he doesn't have

453
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:48,750
You must have seen him

454
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,311
Except moustache they
both are same

455
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:58,151
Same as that Abbas Ali
and Abhishek Bachchan

456
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:03,360
You suspected on my loyality

457
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:07,933
You are my kid

458
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:10,269
One minute!

459
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:15,141
How Abbas could be the brother
of Abbas Ali

460
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:31,421
He know the reality now what
will we tell him

461
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:34,987
You are right

462
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:38,527
that what will we say and how
we will say

463
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,066
that Abbas is not your twin brother

464
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:42,967
but he also your illegal brother

465
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:53,682
And what are you looking at?

466
01:10:55,951 --> 01:10:57,213
You are also involved in this truth

467
01:10:57,953 --> 01:10:58,783
Tell him the story

468
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:01,113
Which story?
Tell him the story of illegal Abbas

469
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:05,117
His dad got a contract

470
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:07,356
to break the stones at side...

471
01:11:08,831 --> 01:11:10,992
A girl named Jameela used to pick
up the bricks there...

472
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:14,198
Dad broke the stones

473
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:16,127
and Jameela picked up the bricks

474
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:21,805
And then his dad gone mad

475
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:28,345
And he is gone behind the stones
with her

476
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:35,117
Then what happened?

477
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:37,388
Then after nine month in one night

478
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,327
Day or Night?
Both!

479
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:41,758
At one place Abhishek born in day

480
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:44,496
and same night Abbas born at
another place

481
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:52,163
Where is Abbas mom?

482
01:11:59,214 --> 01:11:59,703
She is dead!

483
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:03,082
That's why Abbas lived with us

484
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:07,714
Abhishek took his responsibility
along with me

485
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:11,290
What he does?

486
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:13,625
Nothing!
He is a dancer

487
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:17,256
He is a classical dancer

488
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:22,130
Then send him to me

489
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:26,373
He is not good for you

490
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:28,539
You are type of wrestler man

491
01:12:28,911 --> 01:12:30,208
and he is that...

492
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:38,844
Then he is really good for me,
What?

493
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:41,680
You won't understand

494
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:44,348
Send him to me,
I will put him on job

495
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:47,227
Why you are doing so much for me

496
01:12:47,496 --> 01:12:50,431
I will have to remove your burden

497
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:53,063
We don't have relationship of
Boss and Servant

498
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:55,367
your mom is my mom

499
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:57,772
Your brother is my brother

500
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,966
Your sister is...
Boss!

501
01:18:54,116 --> 01:18:57,711
Why did you get Abbas on job?

502
01:18:58,754 --> 01:19:02,212
You often meet these kind of
people in your life

503
01:19:02,658 --> 01:19:04,592
What do you mean?
Out of the blue...

504
01:19:05,961 --> 01:19:07,553
He is good for nothing

505
01:19:08,364 --> 01:19:10,298
But he is good for me

506
01:19:12,268 --> 01:19:13,166
I mean...

507
01:19:14,036 --> 01:19:15,469
He will teach dance to Radhika

508
01:19:16,539 --> 01:19:18,336
then my sister will be secured

509
01:19:19,241 --> 01:19:20,674
You have done greatjob

510
01:19:21,143 --> 01:19:23,441
If T-Series people would be there

511
01:19:23,779 --> 01:19:25,974
then they would must make it's
remix album

512
01:19:26,349 --> 01:19:30,342
then one day you would be famous in
Ranantpur like me

513
01:19:33,356 --> 01:19:34,823
Your dad?
Who?

514
01:19:34,990 --> 01:19:38,551
Shastri get me on job

515
01:19:39,295 --> 01:19:41,286
at Prithvi's place

516
01:19:45,468 --> 01:19:48,062
He is not a wrestler but call him
Wild Buffalo

517
01:19:49,238 --> 01:19:50,762
Let it be...
Why should I let it be?

518
01:19:54,176 --> 01:19:56,701
He carries 100 kg weight but he doesn't
have intelligence of 10 grams

519
01:19:58,614 --> 01:20:01,674
He would have understood that I am
Abhishek and Abbas Ali

520
01:20:03,619 --> 01:20:05,610
Why you are speaking alot?
What happened to you?

521
01:20:14,063 --> 01:20:15,496
You guys acts really well

522
01:20:16,832 --> 01:20:19,562
I have come to tell you that stop
your brother to teach me

523
01:20:20,336 --> 01:20:21,997
but now I will go and stop
my brother

524
01:20:22,505 --> 01:20:24,769
I will stop him to trust fraud people
like you

525
01:20:26,342 --> 01:20:27,104
He is so naive

526
01:20:28,811 --> 01:20:30,472
So everyone wants to take
advantage of him

527
01:20:31,247 --> 01:20:33,477
I am going to tell him the truth

528
01:20:36,652 --> 01:20:38,745
You can tell your brother everything

529
01:20:39,255 --> 01:20:40,381
But before thatjust once...

530
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:42,824
Listen once that why did we lied
to him

531
01:20:46,695 --> 01:20:49,755
A middle man's life doesn't accompalish
to live with it

532
01:20:50,599 --> 01:20:53,864
His life accompalished to fullfill his
family needs

533
01:20:55,037 --> 01:20:56,800
Abbas had few dreams for me

534
01:20:57,406 --> 01:21:00,273
But our family house has been
snatched from us

535
01:21:00,709 --> 01:21:01,937
Abbas lost his job

536
01:21:02,545 --> 01:21:04,069
Shastri Uncle brought us Ranantpur

537
01:21:04,914 --> 01:21:08,247
and Abbas has broken the temple's lock
to save the kid's life

538
01:21:09,118 --> 01:21:13,418
and to handle the situation I told his
name Abhishek Bachchan

539
01:21:14,523 --> 01:21:15,387
And after that...

540
01:21:15,758 --> 01:21:17,623
when Prithvi gave him a nice job

541
01:21:19,428 --> 01:21:22,955
then our mistake didn't felt
offense to us

542
01:21:23,632 --> 01:21:24,963
Mistakes shouldn't be committed

543
01:21:26,168 --> 01:21:27,100
but it happens

544
01:21:29,572 --> 01:21:30,800
You are right

545
01:21:32,475 --> 01:21:34,534
If you want to tell Prithvi everything

546
01:21:35,544 --> 01:21:36,340
so tell him

547
01:21:37,813 --> 01:21:39,007
You know my brother

548
01:21:40,182 --> 01:21:41,581
If he will know the truth

549
01:21:42,151 --> 01:21:44,051
then he will kill all of you

550
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:46,783
That's why we didn't think about to
tell him the truth

551
01:21:56,999 --> 01:21:59,832
Do it as you like

552
01:22:15,417 --> 01:22:17,248
Come from tomorrow to teach
me dance

553
01:27:29,631 --> 01:27:31,895
Ghost is lie

554
01:27:33,268 --> 01:27:35,634
She is Abhishek's sister Sania

555
01:27:39,975 --> 01:27:41,033
Thank God you have come

556
01:27:45,647 --> 01:27:47,774
Will you rehearse with me
for a while

557
01:27:49,017 --> 01:27:51,042
I have no experience of play

558
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:52,746
Your eyes are enough

559
01:27:53,555 --> 01:27:54,647
You have to speak these four lines

560
01:27:58,026 --> 01:28:00,187
I don't know how to speak dialogues

561
01:28:03,365 --> 01:28:05,333
I know how to say listen,
Excellent!

562
01:28:05,701 --> 01:28:07,532
Now you have to look at me and speak

563
01:28:15,777 --> 01:28:18,075
I have to tell you something

564
01:28:20,382 --> 01:28:22,873
Are you expressing the love or
starting the war

565
01:28:40,802 --> 01:28:41,791
Say it from the heart

566
01:40:01,616 --> 01:40:03,083
What is this nonsense?

567
01:40:18,633 --> 01:40:20,863
It means I am your son

568
01:40:21,169 --> 01:40:23,262
you grown up first,

569
01:41:11,753 --> 01:41:13,277
Who are you?

570
01:41:14,188 --> 01:41:15,450
And who you want to meet?

571
01:41:20,528 --> 01:41:22,792
You didn't recognize Prithvi Raj

572
01:41:24,899 --> 01:41:26,867
May I know you?

573
01:41:30,571 --> 01:41:31,799
You better know that...

574
01:41:33,174 --> 01:41:35,199
But I have known you very well

575
01:41:36,978 --> 01:41:37,808
You are widow there,

576
01:41:38,179 --> 01:41:39,237
and here you are dancing

577
01:41:45,353 --> 01:41:48,982
You must have met my twin
sister Madhumati

578
01:41:49,424 --> 01:41:51,654
That wasn't me

579
01:41:52,293 --> 01:41:55,490
I also have two twin nephews,
Abhishek and Abbas

580
01:41:56,664 --> 01:41:59,098
We sisters had twin moms

581
01:42:01,402 --> 01:42:02,460
Is this a family?

582
01:42:02,804 --> 01:42:05,068
Or the factory of making twin kids

583
01:42:11,479 --> 01:42:13,845
He looks like rascal from his face

584
01:42:14,449 --> 01:42:16,007
But you too...
What?

585
01:42:16,684 --> 01:42:17,708
Are also amazing

586
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:23,680
You can't find out the difference
between Madhumati and Zohra

587
01:42:24,726 --> 01:42:28,719
Please forgive me, I had
mis-understanding to see the poster

588
01:42:38,172 --> 01:42:41,232
Give my greetings to my sister

589
01:42:41,642 --> 01:42:45,544
Tell her that Zohra missed her alot

590
01:42:54,756 --> 01:42:55,723
One minute!

591
01:42:56,624 --> 01:42:59,092
How Zohra could be the sister
of Madhumati

592
01:43:00,928 --> 01:43:04,523
I don't feel good to hear the same
story of stone and brick from woman

593
01:43:05,233 --> 01:43:07,258
Abbas must be like her.
Dancer!

594
01:43:09,137 --> 01:43:10,069
Don't you think?

595
01:43:10,838 --> 01:43:14,296
That Zohra's message must be forward
to Madhumati right now,

596
01:43:14,575 --> 01:43:16,304
to his house

597
01:43:17,078 --> 01:43:18,568
They must be sleeping

598
01:43:19,514 --> 01:43:20,845
Sania must be awake

599
01:43:29,223 --> 01:43:31,157
Prithvi's hand was reached here

600
01:43:32,393 --> 01:43:33,860
You were just lucky

601
01:43:34,095 --> 01:43:35,585
In fact I was also lucky

602
01:43:36,197 --> 01:43:39,894
My leg hair were exposed I thought
we all will be exposed

603
01:43:41,636 --> 01:43:42,227
Who is there?

604
01:43:45,139 --> 01:43:46,106
He is back

605
01:43:46,274 --> 01:43:46,865
Get your moustache

606
01:43:59,453 --> 01:44:00,511
I have told you

607
01:44:00,955 --> 01:44:05,221
You can lose your respect to visit
someone's house over and over again

608
01:44:07,361 --> 01:44:09,693
We have come to meet your mom

609
01:44:09,864 --> 01:44:10,489
We have to talk to her

610
01:44:10,832 --> 01:44:13,096
She is taking bath in bathroom

611
01:44:15,436 --> 01:44:16,733
Let's go!
Boss!

612
01:44:16,971 --> 01:44:18,063
Mom's message!

613
01:44:18,372 --> 01:44:19,805
And how much time she will
take to bath

614
01:44:20,842 --> 01:44:22,867
Sania is also here

615
01:44:23,411 --> 01:44:24,844
to give us coffee

616
01:44:25,012 --> 01:44:26,707
Sania!
Can we come in?

617
01:44:42,430 --> 01:44:45,922
Liers must get punishment in climax

618
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:59,704
Where is our Abhishek?

619
01:45:05,753 --> 01:45:07,152
He is gone to temple

620
01:45:11,592 --> 01:45:14,891
One day you all wil be caught
doing this drama

621
01:45:17,598 --> 01:45:19,691
Boss has trusted you alot

622
01:45:20,067 --> 01:45:23,036
and you all are doing fake acting

623
01:45:28,709 --> 01:45:31,177
I know everything about their play

624
01:45:33,614 --> 01:45:38,210
Aflatoon Drama Company is doing it's
play with hardworking

625
01:45:39,887 --> 01:45:40,911
Sania too...

626
01:45:42,890 --> 01:45:46,348
I have invested my money on right place
Nobody is cheating on me

627
01:45:56,938 --> 01:45:59,168
It's too late.
We are leaving

628
01:46:07,348 --> 01:46:09,839
Now the entire tank would be empty

629
01:46:09,984 --> 01:46:11,815
We can have another cup of coffee

630
01:46:12,053 --> 01:46:13,987
Sania!
Would you give us a cup of coffee?

631
01:46:18,459 --> 01:46:20,359
Why are you crying?

632
01:46:20,728 --> 01:46:22,992
Coffee is over in house

633
01:46:23,164 --> 01:46:24,859
What we will offer you?

634
01:46:25,466 --> 01:46:27,331
If coffee is over then give
us tea

635
01:46:30,037 --> 01:46:32,130
He is asking tea

636
01:46:33,507 --> 01:46:35,907
Give him tea and give me poison

637
01:46:36,377 --> 01:46:38,277
What will we do now?

638
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:41,047
Sania!
Who is there?

639
01:46:55,596 --> 01:46:56,392
Not tea!

640
01:46:56,897 --> 01:46:58,091
But we have mom

641
01:46:59,266 --> 01:46:59,994
One minute!

642
01:47:00,501 --> 01:47:03,993
Right now Shastri took bath
from which bathroom

643
01:47:05,006 --> 01:47:08,134
how could mom came out from
the same bathroom

644
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:15,308
When twin brothers could be at home

645
01:47:15,683 --> 01:47:18,083
so we couldn't have twin bathrooms

646
01:47:21,188 --> 01:47:22,917
my sister Zohra called me on phone

647
01:47:27,395 --> 01:47:29,124
You looks rascal from your face

648
01:47:29,530 --> 01:47:31,430
What?
And you too, What?

649
01:47:31,832 --> 01:47:33,197
Are amazing man

650
01:47:33,701 --> 01:47:34,895
You heard him

651
01:47:40,041 --> 01:47:42,635
I am very sorry!
Not at all

652
01:47:44,078 --> 01:47:44,669
I am leaving

653
01:47:50,017 --> 01:47:51,006
How come you are here?

654
01:47:51,485 --> 01:47:53,646
And your sister Zohra?

655
01:47:54,055 --> 01:47:55,249
I will tell you everything

656
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:01,323
No problem!
It will be done

657
01:48:01,829 --> 01:48:05,822
We will have to start the power plant
boundary 150 yards away from here

658
01:48:08,102 --> 01:48:11,094
If I would get this land's papers and
print so it would be better

659
01:48:13,407 --> 01:48:15,204
Give him everything he want

660
01:48:23,184 --> 01:48:25,618
And that greenary in that area...

661
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:33,986
It's not greenary

662
01:48:34,695 --> 01:48:37,129
It's a great view

663
01:48:48,876 --> 01:48:51,572
Two bodies are burning in love

664
01:49:15,402 --> 01:49:17,393
Look! Your Ranantpur is
getting progress

665
01:59:50,437 --> 01:59:51,631
I had warned you

666
01:59:52,139 --> 01:59:53,766
don't step out from Ranantpur

667
01:59:54,107 --> 01:59:56,075
But you were escaping from Rananpur

668
01:59:56,409 --> 01:59:57,137
and for who?

669
01:59:57,310 --> 01:59:59,141
For that coward who left you alone

670
02:00:00,981 --> 02:00:01,913
Why are you quite?

671
02:00:02,149 --> 02:00:02,979
Am I wrong?

672
02:00:04,284 --> 02:00:05,342
You are right

673
02:00:07,287 --> 02:00:08,447
True man is that

674
02:00:08,722 --> 02:00:10,690
who doesn't escape from the problems
but to face them

675
02:00:10,857 --> 02:00:12,256
Am I right?
Yes!

676
02:00:12,926 --> 02:00:16,089
Who shouldn't care for his life but
he put his life in danger for relatives

677
02:00:16,263 --> 02:00:17,491
Am I right?
Yes!

678
02:00:18,031 --> 02:00:20,295
You should have find a life partner

679
02:00:20,467 --> 02:00:22,128
who should protect you everytime
like I did

680
02:00:22,302 --> 02:00:23,326
Am I right?
Yes!

681
02:00:26,039 --> 02:00:27,267
Abhishek!
Yes!

682
02:00:28,041 --> 02:00:29,303
You are absolutely right!

683
02:00:38,185 --> 02:00:39,584
Do you like Radhika?

684
02:00:41,488 --> 02:00:42,580
Do I like Radhika?
Amazing!

685
02:00:42,889 --> 02:00:45,323
You like Radhika.
Do you like Abhishek?

686
02:00:46,159 --> 02:00:46,921
Yes!

687
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:48,850
You have opened my eyes

688
02:00:49,529 --> 02:00:50,427
True man is that

689
02:00:50,630 --> 02:00:51,528
who doesn't escape from the problems

690
02:00:51,898 --> 02:00:53,058
but to face them

691
02:00:53,466 --> 02:00:56,264
who shouldn't care for his life but
he put his life in danger for relatives

692
02:00:56,570 --> 02:00:59,562
I am ready to marry you,
I can't marry with her

693
02:00:59,940 --> 02:01:00,565
Why?

694
02:01:01,308 --> 02:01:02,366
I have a private problem

695
02:01:10,083 --> 02:01:11,812
Nowadays there are so many
medicines in market

696
02:01:12,686 --> 02:01:14,483
and clinics are opened everywhere,
Prithvi!

697
02:01:15,822 --> 02:01:17,221
I can't get married because

698
02:01:17,958 --> 02:01:21,291
until my sister can't get married how
could I get married

699
02:01:23,163 --> 02:01:24,926
You also have a virgin sister

700
02:01:25,966 --> 02:01:27,934
Until she don't get married how
could you get married

701
02:01:32,772 --> 02:01:35,673
Actually today I have come for
the proposal

702
02:01:36,176 --> 02:01:37,700
But...
Abhishek!

703
02:01:38,712 --> 02:01:41,203
When elders are talking so you
shouldn't interfere

704
02:01:51,291 --> 02:01:52,952
What do you think about marriage?

705
02:01:55,695 --> 02:01:57,925
I never think about it

706
02:01:58,999 --> 02:02:00,023
I can understand!

707
02:02:01,167 --> 02:02:04,762
You didn't get time to grown up
your kids and prayers...

708
02:02:07,874 --> 02:02:10,240
to think about my and
Sania's marriage

709
02:02:13,113 --> 02:02:15,206
If I have your permission...
Permission?

710
02:02:15,815 --> 02:02:17,908
Why permission from this Madhumati

711
02:02:18,785 --> 02:02:23,848
Even I jump down to marry with
an honest man like you

712
02:02:25,892 --> 02:02:27,382
for the marriage arrangements

713
02:02:34,234 --> 02:02:35,462
Shut up!
You didn't hear that

714
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:43,100
You get marry with Sania as
soon as possible

715
02:02:43,343 --> 02:02:45,743
Fix the marriage date as
soon as possible

716
02:02:57,457 --> 02:02:58,253
Now not one...

717
02:02:59,025 --> 02:03:01,858
Two brothers will be busy for
thier sister's wedding

718
02:03:09,669 --> 02:03:11,830
What did you need to accept
this proposal?

719
02:03:12,439 --> 02:03:15,408
Does anyone can refuse that
kind of proposal

720
02:03:17,877 --> 02:03:19,811
When Prithvi will know

721
02:03:20,313 --> 02:03:23,043
that he is not marrying with Sania
Bachchan but with Sania Ali

722
02:03:23,683 --> 02:03:24,911
He will kill all of us...

723
02:03:25,785 --> 02:03:28,151
First time you spoke the truth

724
02:03:28,288 --> 02:03:29,880
Prithvi will kill all of us

725
02:03:30,056 --> 02:03:31,182
Everyone is dead!

726
02:03:31,591 --> 02:03:32,319
Do one thing!

727
02:03:32,592 --> 02:03:33,786
Get moustache to Sania

728
02:03:34,027 --> 02:03:36,689
and tell that Prithvi who you have
seen that's not Sania

729
02:03:36,930 --> 02:03:37,897
but her sister Dhania

730
02:03:38,164 --> 02:03:41,133
and you change your looks and tell
I am not Ravi but Govinda

731
02:03:41,634 --> 02:03:43,534
I will also tell that I am not Shastri

732
02:03:43,703 --> 02:03:45,637
but I am a British Jailor

733
02:03:47,607 --> 02:03:49,802
How much you will eat?

734
02:03:50,377 --> 02:03:51,469
Save something for the coutry

735
02:03:51,945 --> 02:03:54,243
If you will go to your village then
they will say someone else is coming

736
02:04:15,435 --> 02:04:16,902
I can't marry with you

737
02:04:23,610 --> 02:04:27,979
I have a personal reason to
shouldn't marry with you

738
02:04:34,754 --> 02:04:36,915
I also had a personal reason
to marry you

739
02:04:56,910 --> 02:04:57,569
She...

740
02:04:59,846 --> 02:05:02,314
I was also shocked when
I saw you first time

741
02:05:07,320 --> 02:05:08,184
She is Abhiksha

742
02:05:09,756 --> 02:05:11,189
I loved her alot

743
02:05:12,759 --> 02:05:15,728
Four years ago God snatched her from
me in an accident

744
02:05:18,398 --> 02:05:19,330
Now she is not here

745
02:05:21,134 --> 02:05:22,931
but I have her picture

746
02:05:25,672 --> 02:05:27,196
Radhika doesn't know about her

747
02:05:30,043 --> 02:05:31,374
After Abhiksha's death

748
02:05:33,313 --> 02:05:35,178
I didn't have wish in my life

749
02:05:37,150 --> 02:05:38,981
I was busy for Ranantpur's progress

750
02:05:41,221 --> 02:05:42,779
Then I saw you...

751
02:05:43,756 --> 02:05:44,586
so I felt...

752
02:05:45,391 --> 02:05:46,915
that my Abhiskha is back

753
02:05:49,028 --> 02:05:49,960
I was forgotten

754
02:05:50,797 --> 02:05:51,821
that you are not Abhiksha!

755
02:05:52,799 --> 02:05:53,857
But you are Sania Bachchan

756
02:06:02,242 --> 02:06:02,936
Forgive me!

757
02:06:04,777 --> 02:06:08,178
I brought the proposal without
your wish

758
02:06:17,257 --> 02:06:18,019
But I am happy

759
02:06:19,859 --> 02:06:21,986
because my sister is getting
married in your house

760
02:07:05,872 --> 02:07:06,861
Come tomorrow morning

761
02:07:15,415 --> 02:07:16,245
Why are you standing here?

762
02:07:17,684 --> 02:07:19,276
We made a big mistake

763
02:07:22,722 --> 02:07:24,622
We are cheating that person

764
02:07:25,124 --> 02:07:26,716
who helped us on every step

765
02:07:30,296 --> 02:07:31,786
He is such an honest
and naive person

766
02:07:33,199 --> 02:07:34,496
When he will know that...

767
02:07:35,001 --> 02:07:37,492
Abbas and Abhishek are not two
but he is the same person then

768
02:07:40,173 --> 02:07:41,367
You have said

769
02:07:42,242 --> 02:07:43,436
if I will keep doing it

770
02:07:44,143 --> 02:07:45,667
then nor Allah will mind it nor
Bhagwan

771
02:07:48,014 --> 02:07:49,914
but what we are doing with
that person

772
02:07:50,917 --> 02:07:53,613
After that every God of every religion
will mind

773
02:08:29,856 --> 02:08:30,618
Are you mad?

774
02:08:30,990 --> 02:08:32,287
Yes!
With happiness

775
02:08:34,827 --> 02:08:37,625
Just once speak the famous question
of Gabbar Singh

776
02:08:40,333 --> 02:08:41,322
How many were they?

777
02:08:42,302 --> 02:08:43,929
Not two but one

778
02:08:44,103 --> 02:08:46,230
What do you mean?
I mean they are not two

779
02:08:46,506 --> 02:08:47,268
but he is one...

780
02:19:00,419 --> 02:19:01,579
Save my boss

781
02:19:02,087 --> 02:19:03,349
It's all happening because of you

782
02:19:03,622 --> 02:19:05,522
Now you save my boss

783
02:19:06,091 --> 02:19:06,921
Me?
Yes!

784
02:19:07,593 --> 02:19:08,753
Have you seen it's deepness

785
02:19:09,361 --> 02:19:11,659
As much I will step as long
I have chances to die

786
02:19:12,531 --> 02:19:14,761
Whatever is happening with
Prithvi it's just

787
02:19:14,934 --> 02:19:15,923
happening because of your lie

788
02:19:16,368 --> 02:19:18,131
From our lie to my lie

789
02:19:18,270 --> 02:19:19,294
I don't know anything

790
02:19:19,571 --> 02:19:21,732
If you won't save him so I will
never see your face again

791
02:19:23,075 --> 02:19:25,043
I am the sister of Prithvi Raj
So?

792
02:19:25,444 --> 02:19:27,742
If you won't save him so I will
never see your face again

793
02:19:29,448 --> 02:19:31,882
I will also support my elders

794
02:19:33,052 --> 02:19:34,144
I won't also see your face again

795
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:35,810
I will never see your face again

796
02:19:35,955 --> 02:19:37,081
and me too

797
02:19:51,770 --> 02:19:52,498
What do you think?

798
02:19:53,339 --> 02:19:54,601
That you will say and I will go

799
02:19:54,773 --> 02:19:56,400
What do you think about me

800
02:19:57,042 --> 02:19:58,441
I am that man who don't feel pain

801
02:20:20,399 --> 02:20:21,525
Save me!

802
02:20:27,806 --> 02:20:28,966
How did you came here?

803
02:20:30,943 --> 02:20:33,002
I have put my life on risk and
come to save you

804
02:20:33,879 --> 02:20:35,005
I forgive you,
What?

805
02:20:35,547 --> 02:20:36,479
You said it to me

806
02:20:36,815 --> 02:20:37,713
that I forgive you

807
02:20:50,195 --> 02:20:51,787
You have ruined that
cricketer's name

808
02:20:53,365 --> 02:20:55,526
Sania you are my sister and
Radhika I am your love

809
02:20:56,835 --> 02:20:58,496
but still you both are on his side

810
02:21:09,615 --> 02:21:11,344
Today you listen to me

811
02:21:12,384 --> 02:21:15,649
If you would break the mosque's lock

812
02:21:16,255 --> 02:21:18,189
then you would tell your name
Prithvi Raj

813
02:21:19,691 --> 02:21:20,715
You know what would you say

814
02:21:21,460 --> 02:21:24,725
My name is Pervez Musharraf,
that's what you would said

815
02:21:36,275 --> 02:21:38,266
I want to fast for your mom,
So go on

816
02:21:38,744 --> 02:21:40,803
Why did you need to come home?

817
02:21:40,946 --> 02:21:43,779
Even kids took 9 month to born

818
02:21:44,316 --> 02:21:49,276
I born 3 moms in single day

819
02:21:53,258 --> 02:21:54,282
You kept me on job

820
02:21:54,960 --> 02:21:55,949
but no!

821
02:21:56,428 --> 02:21:57,952
You also kept my brother on job

822
02:22:02,935 --> 02:22:04,368
I loved your sister

823
02:22:05,804 --> 02:22:06,498
but you also loved my sister

824
02:22:17,316 --> 02:22:18,442
May I tell you one thing
from the bottom of my heart

825
02:22:20,018 --> 02:22:22,543
I never did fraud with my work

826
02:22:23,689 --> 02:22:25,384
I thought if I will keep working
with honesty

827
02:22:26,692 --> 02:22:27,750
then nor Allah will mind

828
02:22:28,427 --> 02:22:29,223
nor Bhagwan

829
02:22:33,499 --> 02:22:38,129
but if you still thinks that
I am wrong

830
02:22:38,504 --> 02:22:39,528
I...

831
02:22:41,373 --> 02:22:42,340
I will jump down from here

832
02:22:49,915 --> 02:22:51,542
Don't try to stop me

833
02:22:52,151 --> 02:22:53,550
Don't hold my hand

834
02:23:01,126 --> 02:23:02,821
Don't leave my hand

835
02:23:29,388 --> 02:23:30,286
I forgive you

836
02:23:40,299 --> 02:23:42,267
I will tell you my feelings today

837
02:23:57,416 --> 02:24:00,715
I will never lie but you also promise

838
02:24:01,386 --> 02:24:03,718
that you will never speak
english again

839
02:24:05,290 --> 02:24:06,655
now pull me up!
