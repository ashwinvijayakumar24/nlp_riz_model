1
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,250
1978...

2
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,370
A time when India-Pakistan
relations were surprisingly strong.

3
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,870
Hotlines were set
up between world leaders.

4
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,720
Trade routes were opened.

5
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,430
A ceasefire was declared on LOC.

6
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,010
But India was dealing
with more Internal issues.

7
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,550
Several anti-national Organisations
had taken root within the country.

8
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,210
JKLF, MNF, TNLA and the
Western India Independence group.

9
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,960
Bombings, shootouts, kidnappings.

10
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,250
Several terrorism
methods were used.

11
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,340
But the most effective
method proved to be 'Hijack'.

12
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,210
Air-India airplanes
were being hijacked.

13
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,660
Each time they
would make their demands.

14
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,960
Often terrorists were released.

15
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,060
Generous amounts would be paid.

16
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,000
A firm stand would result
in the death of civilians.

17
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,550
The government and intelligence
agencies kept trying

18
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,010
but they couldn't
stop the hijackings.

19
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,800
Military action, diplomacy,
intelligence, everything failed.

20
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,050
But as they say...

21
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,050
It takes only one event
to change history.

22
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,180
Ladies and Gentlemen,
seatbelt signs are now off.

23
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,220
Aircraft crew are here to assist you.

24
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,100
Our crew for todays has...

25
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,890
- Meals are heated?
- Yes, sure.

26
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,550
Make sure they are heated.
And I told him you'll get coffee for him.

27
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,180
- Yeah, okay.
- Decaf, no milk.

28
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:26,930
Sure.

29
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,760
And also, we've the All Girl's
Kabaddi Team of India travelling with us

30
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,550
for the World Cup training camp.

31
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,140
Let's give them a big cheer.

32
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,350
Thank you.

33
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,850
Hi, how are you? Welcome, aboard.

34
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,930
How are you, aunty?

35
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,760
All good, son.

36
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,850
I was praying.

37
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,680
Don't worry, we'll deliver you.

38
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,350
- Try some.
- No, it's okay.

39
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,100
You must, aunty, they are delicious.

40
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,930
Okay.

41
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,510
They certainly are good.
And nice flavour too.

42
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,050
Where do you get it?

43
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,640
It's from Pik Fran Bakery,
Made in Pakistan.

44
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,390
Hijack! Hijack!
Sit down!

45
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,640
Hijack!
Hijack!

46
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,100
Hijack!

47
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,970
Hijack!
Heads down!

48
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,640
If anyone has a pen knife, nail cutter,
etcetera, take them out now.

49
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,640
This plane's been hijacked.

50
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,930
Come here.

51
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,300
I will shoot.

52
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,390
Don't move from your seat. Sit down.

53
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,890
Remain seated.

54
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,550
Don't you understand?

55
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,800
Who do you think you are?

56
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,350
- Don't you know what a 'Hijack' is?
- Sit down.

57
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,970
Where do you think you're going?

58
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,100
If anyone gets up from their seat,
I'll drop this grenade.

59
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,010
Do as you're told.

60
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,470
Or else we'll blow
up the entire airplane.

61
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,640
Come on.

62
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,050
Excuse me. You cannot enter...

63
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,010
This is a hijack...not a toilet break.

64
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,970
- Send signal to Moga.
- Why you...

65
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,680
No false moves, Captain.

66
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,350
We'll do as you say,
but we must inform ATC Moga.

67
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,100
No.
We'll tell you which ATC to contact.

68
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,260
Keep flying towards the western sector.

69
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,640
- Come on.
- As you say.

70
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,890
We issued a draft last month.
Here's the...

71
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,220
Call Kao.

72
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,600
Okay.

73
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,100
What are the details?

74
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,970
Madam, ICC-691 left
Delhi Airport at 6:30am.

75
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,390
After which the airplane's
first reporting point was Moga

76
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,050
which it skipped.

77
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,510
The pilot sent a distress
signal to ATC Moga.

78
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,010
Since then ICC-691
has been incommunicado.

79
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,350
See, ma'am.

80
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,890
According to the radar sheets

81
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,680
the airplane was supposed
to head for the North sector.

82
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,680
But now it's heading towards West.

83
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:54,100
If I am not wrong, this is the seventh
hijacking in a span of five years.

84
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,350
The second in my tenure alone.

85
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,300
What have we done to stop it?

86
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,430
We've already installed
metal detectors in all airports.

87
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,300
We've even installed distress
alarm buttons on pilot seats.

88
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,680
And that's as much as we can do.

89
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,640
The intelligence agencies
are more at play here.

90
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,430
Yes, of course.

91
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,760
RAW often passes leads
to the concerned authorities.

92
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,100
Where are the leads?

93
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,550
Why haven't I seen it yet?

94
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,800
'Thirty-Seven, Madam.'

95
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,050
We sent thirty-seven files
with applications for appointments

96
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,640
and leads attached.

97
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,350
'Urgent Matter' mentioned on top.

98
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,100
Now which file is more
important for the PMO

99
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,640
is for the higher
authorities to decide.

100
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,640
Defence Ministry and
Prime Minister's Office

101
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,430
were busy with the MIG 21 deal, Santok.

102
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,100
This is a failure on
the Civil Aviation's part.

103
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,850
Strengthen your security.

104
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,640
Delhi Police is always
busy with political duty.

105
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,760
We're doing our best.

106
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,640
What is this?
Musical chairs?

107
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,680
Passing the parcel?

108
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,640
National Security is our
collective bloody responsibility.

109
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,640
It's our job.

110
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,890
What organisation do
the hijackers belong to?

111
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,760
We've summoned the Intelligence
Bureau's Director Tejashwar.

112
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,430
I am sure he must be
having some information.

113
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,640
But we've to wait for him.

114
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,680
Actually, you don't need to wait, madam.

115
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,100
There is a man who can give us every
information related to this case.

116
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,640
He's a RAW analyst, madam.

117
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,640
He takes care of the hijack desk.

118
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,800
He's read every little detail

119
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,850
about every hijacking
case in the last two years

120
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,680
and deeply analysed them.

121
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,930
Santok, we're trying to discuss a
solution for a national security breach.

122
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,550
And you want the Prime
Minister to meet some desk clerk.

123
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,600
Call the Army Chief instead.

124
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,050
I mean, please, let's not waste time.

125
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,220
Exactly my point, sir.
Let's not waste time.

126
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,430
Okay, what is his name?

127
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,220
Okay, I understand the protocol.

128
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,850
What is his codename?

129
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,640
Bell Bottom.

130
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,640
Hijacking cases are
not just his job, madam.

131
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:13,890
It's a necessity for him.

132
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,010
He's personally invested in the case.

133
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,800
What do you mean personally invested?

134
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,000
In order to achieve great
things we must...

135
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,220
...live as though we were never...

136
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,470
You teach French and German.
Play chess on a national level.

137
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,640
And teach music.
You're preparing for the UPSC exam.

138
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,930
What's next? Landing on the moon.

139
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,390
My mom always says

140
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,890
always have a backup for your backup.

141
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,350
- Oh no...
- What?

142
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,510
That reminds me...I had to
attend my neighbour's wedding.

143
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,930
See you later.

144
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,220
Don't tell me you're the priest too!

145
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,800
"Since I saw your gorgeous eyes..."

146
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,470
What happened?

147
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,800
What happened?

148
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,680
Just a little breathless.

149
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,970
- It's okay. I am alright.
- Come sit here.

150
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,760
Sarika, look.

151
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,470
'Ladies and Gentlemen,
they say matches are made in heaven.'

152
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,180
'As you can see here's the groom.'

153
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,930
Off I go...

154
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,350
- Where?
- To London.

155
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,470
Again?

156
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,180
Why are you jealous?
Again she asks.

157
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,260
Because you never take her along.

158
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,300
Greetings, mom.

159
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,680
- Bless you!
- How are you?

160
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,640
Hello. Hello.

161
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,720
Did you arrange Pounds
for my London trip?

162
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,930
- I...I...
- Shut up!

163
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,470
If this was Ashu

164
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,350
I would never have
to tell him anything twice.

165
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,800
Bloody cheapskate.

166
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,140
- Mom, listen to me...
- What mom.

167
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,510
- Now watch what I do.
- She doesn't love me.

168
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,640
But I do.
Can we get a room here?

169
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,510
You must be crazy.

170
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,300
Only this morning we...

171
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,430
You should quit chess
and take up football

172
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,930
for more stamina.

173
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,010
Do you want to see my stamina?

174
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,260
Come this way.

175
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,350
- Hello. Hello. All eyes on this side.
- The old woman's lost her mind.

176
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:20,180
Coming up next to rock
your evening is my son.

177
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,550
Anshuman...

178
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,050
No, no, no...I am not singing.

And sing that song you used to
sing for her before you two got married.

184
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,640
Go on.

185
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,930

you love me much more sweetheart,."

"Your heart's what I want, 'cause
your heart's just bigger than mine."

188
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:30,640
"But I'm willing to wait forever
wherever you say, sweetheart..."

189
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:35,260

190
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:39,470

191
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:47,760
"If you're not mine, sweetheart."

192
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,350
"I've dedicated my life to you."

193
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,640
"I will stop believing."

"If you're not mine, sweetheart."

202
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:54,600
"Honestly I don't believe you."

203
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,220
"I don't..."

204
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:02,890
"But it's true you're the one I love."

205
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,680
"Only you..."

206
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,390
"If you promise to be mine forever"

207
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,930

208
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:20,390

214
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,890
O Birbal,
what do you have for emperor Pandu?

215
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,760
A gift, your highness.

216
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,850
Gift?

217
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,010
- What kind of gift is this?
- A gift...

218
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:03,050
A gift... this amazing gift,
your highness.

219
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,640
Let's check what the gift is.

220
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,930
- Would you like to see it?
- Yes, yes.

221
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,760
- Are you sure?
- Yes...

222
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,180
- Then see...
- Have you made up your mind?

223
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,720
Pound!

224
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,890
Pound in India!

225
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,600
Now she can go on a
shopping spree in London.

226
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,350
What bank did you rob?

227
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,850
Are you happy now, mom?

228
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,430
You...

229
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,800
But honestly...

230
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,890
Cash is a whole different story.

231
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,680
I've kept one inhaler in your purse

232
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,180
and another one in your suitcase.

233
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,510
I was thinking about
taking pinnies for Ashu.

234
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,470
Ashu loves pinnies.

235
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,430
And let's not forget that fat
cow who's waiting to devour everything.

236
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,010
Show some respect for family members.

237
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,800
Feel free to take them.

238
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,640
You don't have to disrespect anyone.

239
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,430
Do you like disrespecting
women in our family?

240
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,510
Fine, I am taking pinnies for Ashu.

241
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,850
You've Ginni here.

242
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,640
I said it with the utmost respect.

243
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,680
If you want to make pinnies for me

244
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,680
you can come back on Diwali
and make them for me. I'll wait.

245
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,430
Are you coming back on Diwali?

246
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,600
Don't settle down there.

247
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,180
Ashu's home is much better.

248
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,550
All we got is this old rundown cooler.

249
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,720
He's got an AC.

250
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,640
But I keep refilling water every day.

251
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,680
And, also change the padding every
season, especially from Rajouri Garden.

252
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,760
No...
AC's are much better.

253
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,220
Don't you get it?

254
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,390
Ashu loves me so much.
He takes care of everything.

255
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,510
Did you pack Gutka Saheb as well?

256
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,010
Yes, I did.

257
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,760
- Did you set the alarm?
- I did.

258
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,050
And did you keep
the passport and ticket?

259
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,930
Those too.

260
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,390
Go on. Turn off the lights.

261
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,680
I had something to say.

262
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,430
What?

263
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,050

282
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,970
- Yes Bell Bottom for me...
- You should be ashamed.

283
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,640
You don't send anything
for your older brother

284
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,300

you're sending this big list.

Each time I lag behind in the physicals.

355
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,100
Your boarding pass.

356
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,430
'Vikram request to clear
gate G for passenger arrival.'

357
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
Okay, thank you.

358
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,470
Yes.

359
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,640
Boarding pass, sir.

360
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,800
'Morning, Ladies and Gentlemen.'

361
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,850
'Flight AI-476 is ready for take-off.'

362
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,930
Anshul...

363
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,850
Excuse me.

364
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,260
I don't have any information.

365
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,720
Sorry...
I don't have any information.

366
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,430
Please try to understand.

367
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,680
Madam...Please tell us something.

368
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,100
You must have some
information about the flight.

369
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,050
Sir, as I've already said

370
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,600
all we know is that the
plane was taken to Lahore.

371
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,050
You can get more information
from the Home Ministry.

372
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,260
Please try to understand

373
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:23,350
the airline's has already given you
all the information it has.

374
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,550
Sir, sir...

375
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,390
Listen to us...
Give us some information.

376
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,890
'Pakistan President Zia-Ul-Haq
has assured Prime Minister Morarji Desai'

377
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,430
'that he'll successfully
negotiate with the hijackers.'

378
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:51,640
'We want to tell our listeners that the
hijacked airplane is still in Lahore.'

379
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,220
The Minister's here.

380
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:01,350
Calm down. Calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.

381
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,220
We want to thank Pakistani
President Zia-Ul-Haq.

382
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,510
Thanks to him, our negotiation
with the hijackers were a success.

383
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:12,470
They are releasing all the hostages
in exchange for a couple of demands.

384
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:16,010
And all the hostages will be
brought to Delhi from Lahore by train.

385
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,100
'Train no. 16171 is a special train'

386
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,430
'which is ferrying the
passengers of AI-876 from Lahore.'

387
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:29,430
'We request all relatives to
observe patience on the platform'

388
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,350
'and wait for the train to halt.'

389
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,350
'Thank you.'

390
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,010
'Your attention, please.'

391
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,470
'This announcement is for
the relative of Raavi Malhotra.'

392
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,680
'Any relative of Raavi
Malhotra report to S3.'

393
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,180
Inspector, I am Anshul Malhotra.

394
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,890
Is she your mother?

395
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,510
Raavi Malhotra

396
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:15,350
the only casualty of the hostage crisis,
has died of natural causes.

397
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,390
Come on.

398
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,930
It's your right, brother.

399
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,890
And anyway, she liked the AC more.

400
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,970
And she always told
me she liked your cooler.

401
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,100
She said she loved you more.

402
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,970
Yes.

403
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,430
Okay.

404
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,640
Bell Bottom.

405
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,640
Thank you.

406
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,100
Good morning , Ma'am...

407
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,800
Good morning everyone.

408
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,470
So...what does your analysis say?

409
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,970
ISI is the mastermind
behind the hijacking!

410
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:40,350
I am very,
very sorry about the delay, madam.

411
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,220
But I come with hard evidence.

412
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,010
According to IB's leads

413
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:46,180
Punjab's Azaadi Dal
is behind this hijacking.

414
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,470
Could we take a look
at this video, please?

415
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,600
This video was shot by
a BBC journalist five days ago.

416
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,850
Our agents make a
copy at Palam Airport

417
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,140
repack it, and send it back.

418
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,180
Carnivore system. We've to resort
to such means to obtain information.

419
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,680
Madam, this is Tejpal.

420
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,680
Founder of the Azaadi Dal.

421
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,800
'We've our own language,
religion, and methods of living.'

422
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,640
'If they can make
Pakistan for Muslims'

423
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,760
'then why not make
a separate country for us?'

424
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,010
'Separate us and close the topic.'

425
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,640
'What if the government
doesn't approve your demands?'

426
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,180
'Then we'll do what PLO
has been doing with Israel.'

427
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:32,890
'We'll do what we did in '79,
'80, and '82.'

428
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:36,100
We arrested Tejpal as
soon as we received this video.

429
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,010
He's lodged in Tihar Jail as we speak.

430
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,260
And we're absolutely sure that
plane's been hijacked for his release.

431
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,260
Sorry, sir, you're partly right,
partly wrong.

432
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,550
Azaadi Dal is just a facade, madam.

433
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,760
The real mastermind
of the hijack is ISI.

434
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,100
The leader of Azaadi Dal is
clearly threatening our government

435
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,220
- and you're saying ISI's the mastermind.
- Yes, sir.

436
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,180
ISI plans and thinks
like a clever chess player.

437
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,550
Azaadi Dal and other such organisations
are just puppets, ma'am.

438
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,300
And the strings are controlled by ISI.

439
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,680
IB thinks making copies
of BBC's tapes is a smart move.

440
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:11,930
What they don't know
is ISI does the same.

441
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,640
Sir, you didn't get to this interview.

442
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,640
You were led to this interview

443
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:20,140
to divert your
attention on Azaadi Dal.

444
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,260
Whereas the entire conspiracy
has been created by ISI.

445
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,180
But how are you so sure that
the ISI is behind this hijacking?

446
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,760
There are three reasons, ma'am.

447
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,600
Can you give me that?

448
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,260
- What?
- The remote.

449
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,350
Thank you, sir.

450
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,970
'Separate us and close the topic.'

451
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,550
"Gal Mukao".

452
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,930
This is a Multani
expression and not Punjabi.

453
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,890
In Punjabi they say "Gal khatam karo...

454
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:51,720
Baat khatam karo,
syapa mukao" (end the topic)

455
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,890
The second reason.

456
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,890
Ma'am, the way he's wrapped
the turban in the front

457
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,760
is how the Punjabis of Multan,
or Faisalabad, Dera Ismail Khan,

458
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,720
or Sargodha, wrap their turban.

459
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,760
Meaning Punjabis of Pakistan.

460
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,600
And third ma'am, pattern.

461
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,890
Azaadi Dal has indeed hijacked
airplanes thrice before.

462
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:15,350
But why were the planes taken to
the same destinations in all instances?

463
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,850
Lahore.

464
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,720
Why can't they find a different spot?

465
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,760
They can go to Colombo,
Kathmandu, or Kabul.

466
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,640
Why Lahore?

467
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,600
- Because...
- The ISI is involved?

468
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,430
Do you know

469
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:30,680
after years of efforts, have the
India-Pakistan relations strengthened?

470
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,930
Your baseless speculations
can end everything.

471
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,680
I agree with you, Khan sir.

472
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:41,100
Pakistan denied landing request to
a hijacked plane in 1982 on our request.

473
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,640
The lives of 240 passengers were saved.

474
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:51,600
1980. Pakistani forces raided the hijacked
flight and saved 212 passengers.

475
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,890
Do you know that?

476
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,140
1979...

477
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,890
Pakistan negotiated.
180 passengers were saved.

478
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,890
Again, sir.
You both are partly right, partly wrong.

479
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,970
Let him speak, Santok.

480
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,350
Thank you, ma'am.

481
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,100
1982...

482
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:13,140
The flight was given permission
to land after denying it once.

483
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,180
240 passengers were saved

484
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:18,050
but in exchange for four terrorists.

485
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,680
1980...

486
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
212 passengers were released

487
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,890
in exchange for two
terrorists and 40 million rupees.

488
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,760
1979...

489
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,850
Hostages released.

490
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:33,220
But in exchange for seven terrorists,
plus cash rupees 20 million also.

491
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:39,050
And yes...
179 passengers were saved.

492
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,300
One passenger lost her life.

493
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,970
I don't blame the Pakistani public.

494
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,970
But there have always been few political
stakeholders on the other side

495
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,850
who doesn't like peace in India.

496
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,890
Do you have any evidence, Santok?

497
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:54,050
Any hard evidence at
all of ISI's involvement.

498
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,010
The accent you're pointing out

499
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:59,220
is still spoken by the Punjabi
families of Mukherjee Nagar

500
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,350
who moved here during the partition.

501
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,680
And as for the turban...

502
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,930
Maybe it was done in haste.

503
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,220
And what about the third point, sir?

504
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,890
As always,
the plane will land in Lahore.

505
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,220
Sir...

506
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,680
Sir, the plane has landed.

507
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,510
Where?

508
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,850
Amritsar.

509
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,850
The core team, please continue to stay.

510
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,050
Everybody else may leave.

511
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,510
Absolutely waste of time.

512
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:35,720
Want nonsense is this, Santok?

513
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,850
This is an urgent matter

514
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,720
and he's quoting statements
based on assumptions.

515
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:41,970
Who got him into RAW?

516
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,970
'The Islamabad High Court
sentenced all hijackers'

517
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:52,510
'to 10-years-imprisonment in connection
to the Air India 476 hijacking case.'

518
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,140
'In recent news, the culprits'

519
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:57,680
'will be taken to Nankana Saheb Gurudwara
from Attack fort Jail in Pakistan'

520
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,350
'Let's find out Prime Minister
Morarji Desai's views.'

521
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,890
'The crime was committed
on Pakistan's land.'

522
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:08,180
'They have the right
to punish the hijackers.'

523
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,100
'But Mr. Prime Minister'

524
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,470
'the Pakistani court has
taken them out of regular jail'

525
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,850
'and put them under house
arrest in NanKana Saheb.'

526
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,180
'What kind of punishment is this?'

527
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,220
'President Zia-Ul-Haq is a decent man.'

528
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:23,550
'I will not doubt his decision.'

529
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,890
Anshul. Anshul.

530
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,760
Who are you?
What do you want?

531
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,470
Where are you taking me?

532
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,390
Leave me.

533
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:01,800
Sit.

534
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:08,220
Anshul Malhotra.
5/58, Gurdwara Road, Karol Baug.

535
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,850
Who are you people?
And why did you bring me here?

536
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:14,140
Age.32, married. Sharp memory.

537
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,890

English, German, and French.

540
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,390
Please let me go. Please.

541
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,140
We don't want anything from you.

542
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,140
In fact, we want to give you something.

543
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,600
A Chance.

544
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,640
Your first question, who are we?

545
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:36,050
Have you heard about the RAW?
R A W

546
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,010
Your second question, why are you here?

547
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,010
One of our talent spotters
gave us your detail.

548
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:51,890
Mother was a housewife.

549
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,680
Wife works for MTNL.

550
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,600
Brother Ashu is settled in London.

551
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,640
We know everything about you.

552
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,720
We think you can be of use to us,
and we to you.

553
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,430
Like a plug and socket.

554
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,600
I don't want anything from you.
Please let me go.

555
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,300
Asthma.
Breathlessness.

556
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,100
Constantly struggling to breathe.

557
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,220
Without the inhaler,
life feels slowly slipping away.

558
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,050
Heartrate slowly dips.

559
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:26,510
And...passenger Raavi Malhotra.

560
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,300
Seat 34A.

561
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:34,260
Isn't that what happened
with your mother?

562
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,850
Except for one difference.

563
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:40,510
It was not natural.
It was murder.

564
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,890
We've done our research.

565
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,890
The air pressure dips
in a stationary plane.

566
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,680
Pressure dips.

567
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,600
- One feels suffocated.
- What's happening to you?

568
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,180
Your mother told the
hijackers about her condition.

569
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,430
She asked for her purse for
the inhaler...but they refused.

570
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,970
Hey...sit down.
I said sit down.

571
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:04,890
What's in it?

572
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,430
She tried telling them two more times.

573
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:11,680
In a fit of rage,
he flushed the inhaler.

574
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,600
When the passengers began
to panic looking at her condition

575
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,140
the hijacker dragged
her out and dumped her

576
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,430
in the galleys outside the cockpit.

577
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,010
She was ordered to sleep

578
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,680
and put heavy blankets over her.

579
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,970
Hijacker's name was Daljeet Singh Dodi.

580
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,680
You've until 5am tomorrow to decide.

581
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,680
Game on or Game off.

582
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,100
Let's go, guys.

583
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,600
Come.

584
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,010
- Hello.
- 'What have you decided?'

585
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,640
Game on.

586
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:01,640
'There's a BSF campus
in front of Pragati Ground.'

587
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,720
'Be there. You've 20 minutes.'

588
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,600
One! Two! One! Two!

589
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,680
We've selected several
other candidates like you.

590
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,680
Few from the campus and some
with the help of talent spotters.

591
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:30,640
There's no working part-time in RAW.

592
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,220
It's a full-time job. No Sundays,
no holidays, no paternity, no Diwali.

593
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:39,140
Every month 1500 rupees will
be deposited into your account.

594
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,890
100,000 life cover.

595
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,390
You'll no longer be Anshul Malhotra.

596
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,680
You'll be given a codename.

597
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:47,850
Dollar.

598
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:48,720
Sunder.

599
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,430
Bell Bottom.

600
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,180
Saand.

601
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:50,680
Pucchi.

602
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,300
For friends and family, you're
training for an embassy official's job.

603
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,680
UPSC clear. Training begins next month.

604
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,890
Boys, this film was not
for entertainment purposes.

605
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,680
It was for testing your memory.

606
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:32,720
Which author's book
was Sharmila Tagore holding?

607
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,600
Alistar Mclain.

608
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,600
Book's name?

609
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,890
When Eight Bells Toll.

610
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,720
The jeep crosses an ambassador car.

611
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,680
The number plate?

612
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,890
Number 387.

613
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:44,640
Boys, buck up.
This was your observation test.

614
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:50,300
A RAW team should be aware
of what's happening around him.

615
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,430
Sir, this is Bell Bottom's
stage one report.

616
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:09,680
Go on.

617
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,300
Aim, top class.
Mental strength, good.

618
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,720
But...average in physicals.

619
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,140
Whose job is it to make him excellent?

620
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,430
Turn his mental strength
from good to best.

621
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,510
Make him play chess with national-level
chess champions to lose the extra weight.

622
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,010
Because they burn as many calories

623
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:29,600
as a tennis player by
simply applying their mind.

624
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:11,430
Training over. Job begins.

625
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:13,930
Meet embassy official.

626
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:17,850
This is the hijack desk.

627
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:20,050
There were three hijackings
during your training.

628
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,720
Go through every minute
detail in every file.

629
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,100
Okay.
Attaboy.

630
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:41,010
'Things can get very destructive
if you don't agree to our demands...'

631
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:09,180
Sir, consequently the reorganisation
associated the few post.

632
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:09,680
Yes.

633
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,050
Sir, I've a request.
My brother just had a daughter.

634
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,760
Need to take a short trip to London.
Can I get five-day leave?

635
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,100
You'll have to buy your own ticket.

636
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:16,970
I will.

637
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:17,930
Okay, go.

638
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,260
Thank you.

639
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:22,550
We're supposedly India's James Bond

640
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:24,050
But have to pay for own fuel.

641
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:35,140
Here for the naming ceremony?

642
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,010
- Not me. The kid.
- I know that.

643
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,720
There's a wedding in progress. This way.

644
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,930
This way.

645
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,970
"The gardener raises of the flower"

646
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:15,010
"but some stranger plucks it away."

647
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:18,140

"The entire world is going to mix
with mud in the end..."

656
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:14,970
"The only thing that remains
is words if love, god..."

657
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:17,970
"I pray for your good health."

658
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:21,180

Her aunt and uncle will pick a name.

664
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:38,140
Raavi.

665
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:40,930

Get up.
Get up.

Are you okay, gentleman?

670
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,390
- Are you okay?
- Sorry.

Show me your hand.

Are you okay?

Any stress?

678
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,720
A lot.

679
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,600
Fine, I won't give you more.

680
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,600

The question is, where is
the fourth hijacker Daljeet aka Dodi?

694

We'll find him like we found the others.

695
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:20,930
Surprising. We have details
on every hijacker except for Dodi.

696
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:23,430
We won't get any information
on him because he's not Indian.

697
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:25,100
- What?
- He's a covert agent of ISI

and keeping them in Nankana Saheb...

705
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:46,390
And giving them asylum offshore
with a different identity.

706
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:47,760
This is how they work.

707
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,760
But why are they doing this?

709
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,260

710
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:53,600
Order a coke.

711
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,970
Excuse me, one coke, please.

1971, India helps East
Pakistan and forms Bangladesh.

713
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:08,100
ISI decides to take
revenge and hatches a plan.

714
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:09,720
Operation Topaz.

715
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,850
Operation Topaz?

716
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:14,220
Topaz blade, sir.
Used for cutting.

717
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,680
Just like India separated
Bangladesh from Pakistan

718
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,720
similarly, they plan to separate
many parts from the map of India.

719
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:25,350
North East, South, up North and West.

720
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:28,720
Terror organisations are funded.

721
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,720
And they are trained and provoked
by sending covert agents like Dodi.

722
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:37,970
Thank you.

723
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,680
ISI has been spreading
terrorism in India

724
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,970
for years under the
pretence of friendship.

725
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:48,720
JKLF, Azaadi Dal, MNF, are no one, sir.

726
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:50,850
They are pawns of ISI.

727
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,760
Let's stop the chase. What do you want?

728
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,260
Sir, if we can interrogate
these hijackers

729
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,470
then we can get evidence against ISI

730
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:22,550
and we can show this
evidence to our leaders

731
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:25,260
and prove that Pakistan
is playing games with us

732
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:26,430
under the pretence of friendship.

733
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,600
For this, I've planned a mission.

734
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,510
Just need your permission
and the four agents you got with you.

- So...what's the plan.

Sir, it's the India Vs West
Indies World Cup finals tomorrow.

- Yeah...
- What do you mean?

Madam, break the pattern.

793
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:07,430
We've always given them
permission to negotiate.

794
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:09,430
We've always paid the ransom,
released terrorists.

795
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,180
Not this time.

796
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:14,680
Don't give Pakistan permission
to negotiate with the terrorists.

01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:15,890
Transfer the pressure. Shock them!

798
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:18,800
This is absolute nonsense.

These matters are
solved through diplomacy.

800
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,890
Taking a firm stand can also
be disastrous. Do you understand that?

801
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:28,800
Killing a couple of hostages
is not a big deal for them.

802
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:32,010
But it is a big deal for the party.
And elections are around the corner.

Don't let them negotiate.

I am sure you've received the news.

01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:58,720
A hijacked Indian Airline
flight has landed in Lahore.

808
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,720
If we hadn't given them permission

809
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,600
the hijackers would've
crash-landed the plane.

810
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:07,470
This is the fourth instance.

811
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,930
But Pakistan can
understand your position.

812
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:14,470
Because dealing with an internal
affair is much more challenging.

813
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:15,970
Anyway...

814
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:19,850
As always, our team is ready
to negotiate with the hijackers.

815
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:24,600
As per United Nation's protocol,
we need a formal go-ahead from you.

816

Did I hear this right, madam PM?

821
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:43,260
Yes, Zia sir.

822
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,760
As you mentioned,
this is the fourth instance.

823
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:50,720
And we don't want
to bother you every time.

824
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:55,760
So don't negotiate with
the hijackers this time.

825
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,720
Our officials will handle it.

826
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,640

We'll deliver your
message to the hijackers.

01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,850
Also, one more request, Zia sir.

829
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,050
Don't refuel the plane.

830
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:16,390

I need a vision for
the next 100-years, Mr. Rao.

835
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:28,180
Not the next elections.

836
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:32,760
I trust him.

837
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:34,260
Thank you, ma'am.

01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,700
The old woman's lost it.
She's clever.

839
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:54,240
No, sir. It's RAW.

840
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:56,700
But be rest assured.

841
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,450
We've a solution for
this problem as well.

842
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,030
What?

843
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:03,320
Ma'am, this is the IC-691
300 series carrier aircraft.

844
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,820
It uses 750 gallons of fuel in one hour.

845
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:10,570
While taking off from Delhi,
it fuelled 3000 gallons

846
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:12,990
out of which they
have already used half.

847
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:16,280
The Amritsar landing will prove to
be pretty expensive for the terrorists.

848
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:21,150
With the remaining fuel, they can go
to any destination in the Asian region.

849
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:24,200
Possibilities are Kathmandu,
Colombo, and...

850
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,860
- Kabul.
- Yes, Kabul.

851
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:30,240
And even the ISI know we've better
diplomatic relations in these regions.

852
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,950
We can stop them from landing

853
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:33,650
or even send our forces.

854
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:37,320
That leaves us with three more possible
destinations in the Middle East.

855
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:40,070
Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Muscat.

856
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:42,780
The Middle East country
airspace has never been violated.

857
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:45,200
And they are least
prepared for a hijack.

858
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:47,530
Middle-East is our best option, sir.

859
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:50,650
Meaning the problem
is going beyond our control.

860
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:52,150
Just a perspective, madam.

861
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:54,570
If the plane's refueled

862
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:57,240
it will be taken to Europe, America,
or Africa.

863
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,900
And then the situation
Would really be beyond our control.

864
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,150
The flight's presence
in Pakistan is bad news itself.

865
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,240
But outside Pakistan...

866
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:08,240
The Indian Ocean region,
that's our best bet.

867
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,400
We've an opportunity to
do what's never been done before.

868
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,860
What can we do?

869
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,110
A covert operation.

870
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:19,900
An operation to save the hostages
and neutralise the terrorists.

871
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:23,110
One needs to prepare for any operation.

872
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,320
And preparation takes time.

873
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,740
RAW is always ready
to begin when the time comes

874
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:28,280
and we prepare before time.

875
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,280
And also exits before time's over.

876
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:34,030
Madam, not one hijack operation
has succeeded to date.

877
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:35,950
It has.
The Mossad's have.

878
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,570
Operation Thunderbolt.

01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:40,240
Five hostages dead,
one officer martyred.

880
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,360
Success means no casualty.

881
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,070
Not a single life lost.

882
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:48,320
Fine, you tell us what the
success rate of this mission is?

883
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,110
For RAW, one per cent chance
means a cent per cent attempt.

884
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,950
We're gamblers, sir.
We take a chance at every step.

885
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:56,780
RN Kao

886
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,780
Creator of RAW.

887
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:06,110
Okay, what do you need from us?

888
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:10,030
Minister of External Affairs, Mr. Rao.

889
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:11,860
Minister Civil Aviation, Mr. Khan.

890
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:15,240
Their presence and experience
are crucial for RAW's mission.

891
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,530
- Granted.
- Thank you.

892
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:20,400
RAW will prepare for its operation.

893
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:24,450
And we'll create backchannel
talks at our end.

894
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:28,700
But remember, your deadline is sunset.

895
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:30,610
Don't waste time, Chief.

896
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:34,990
Teach India a lesson that
will send chills down their spine.

897
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:37,200
Consider it down, Sadr.
I promise.

898
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:39,860
- Call the press.
- Yes, sir.

899
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:46,700
This is John Connor reporting from
the... tarmac here at Lahore airport.

900
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:49,650
While we wait for the Pakistani
diplomats and officers.

901
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:57,530
They are now taking food and medical
supplies to the passengers inside.

902
01:05:57,530 --> 01:06:01,030
Sandhu...will we get freedom?

903
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,240
Total freedom, bro.

904
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:10,990
Sir, please...help us.

905
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:13,570
We want to go back home.

906
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:14,820
We want to.

907
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:17,780
But your government isn't allowing us.

908
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:19,150
I am sorry.

909
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:26,820
Indira Gandhi didn't give
us permission to negotiate.

910
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:27,900
She didn't give permission!

911
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:29,490
What do you mean?

912
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:31,900
Will there be no negotiation?

913
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:34,650
You told me to get the plane. I did.

914
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,200
After that, I'll be paid in full.

915
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,240
You'll send me to London or Canada.

916
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,030
Meaning you won't keep
that part of your promise either.

917
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:42,150
Calm down...

918
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:43,820
Shoot.

919
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:47,650
You know,
and so do we that it's just a toy.

920
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,200
You said take these Punjabis for a spin.

921
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,490
- But you took me for a spin instead.
- You fool!

922
01:06:57,070 --> 01:06:58,320
Don't forget...

923
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:01,320
You're just a low-class
goon from Lahore.

924
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:03,570
Know your place before you speak.

925
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:08,240
Now quietly do as we say.

926
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,240
Otherwise, you'll rot in Indian jails.

927
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,240
Okay, sir.

928
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,490
I'll do as you say.

929
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:21,700
You don't have to do anything more.

930
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:26,240
Someone else will take
over the plan from here.

931
01:07:27,530 --> 01:07:28,320
Who?

932
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:40,240
Doddy?

933
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:43,780
Plan revision.

934
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:49,320
This plane still has enough fuel
to fly to some country outside Lahore.

935
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:52,490
A country where India
will be forced to negotiate.

936
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:53,860
Dubai.

937
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,900
Dubai hasn't seen hijacks.

938
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,650
Their government believes in humanity.

939
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,450
To keep the hostages safe,
they will give you landing permission

940
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:06,610
and also build pressure
on India to negotiate.

941
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:10,240
We'll shoot two hostages
every hour to scare them.

942
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,650
And the first victim will be a woman.

943
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,820
But what will you shoot them with?

944
01:08:18,150 --> 01:08:19,030
This?

945
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:21,490
This.

946
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:27,990
German made.

947
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:29,490
Satellite phone.

948
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:34,360
And the list of demands.

949
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:36,900
Give me your jacket.

950
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:54,900
'The official are
now leaving the aircraft'

951
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:57,820
'after ensuring the safety
of the passengers and crew.'

952
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,780
What do you think the ISI will do next?

953
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:03,700
I don't know, sir.
They are not my uncle.

954
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:07,490
Sorry, sir.

955
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,570
Where is Sandhu?

956
01:09:19,570 --> 01:09:22,280
Sandhu got nervous.
I'll handle it now.

957
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,650
Pakistan's with us.

958
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,110
Here.

959
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:32,240
It's real.

960
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:35,780
Have fun.

961
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:44,200
Santok sir.

962
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:46,240
We've satellite details.

963
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:48,990
And also confirmation
from international aviation.

964
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:52,240
IC-691 took off from Lahore
crossed the Gulf of Oman...

965
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:53,360
It's headed straight to Dubai.

966
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,860
As expected.

967
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:57,320
I know this is RAW's case.

968
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,200
But if IB can help you in any way...

969
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,400
I mean, just feel free to ask.

970
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,950
Covert agent, Dubai.

971
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,610
RAW doesn't have one.

972
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:05,200
IB doesn't have one either.

973
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,610
But I'll try the
international agencies, okay.

974
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:08,490
That should be good.

975
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:10,110
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks.

976
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:11,030
Come, sir. After you.

977
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:19,320
We'll have to log
the operational details.

978
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,780
We must aim to take off at 12:30pm.

979
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:34,030
Thank you, Mr. Tejaswar.
Over and out.

980
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:37,570
IB has established
contact with a 6K agent.

981
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:39,650
Adila Rehman.
It's an alias.

982
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:41,700
She's posted at the
help desk at Dubai airport.

983
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:46,530
We'll get spying devices
but not sure of ammunitions.

984
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:51,400
Sir, I'll need airport maps,
entry-exit points, weather sheets too.

985
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:55,700
Will you do everything alone?

986
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,360
- Hello, guys.
- Hello.

987
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,240
Hi...

988
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:10,950
Hello.

989
01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:13,360
Sir, what's the mission?

990
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,320
The operation is
called Operation Mirage.

991
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,610
Entering the plane and
launching a sudden attack.

992
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:21,820
Our team, dressed as the refuelling
team, will reach the refuelling duct.

993
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:24,860
Then team 1, meaning Saand and me

994
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:26,700
will move stealthily under the plane

995
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:29,240
and enter the plane's luggage section.

996
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:36,780
This Boeing's luggage section
is connected with the tail end.

997
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,990
Team 1 will neutralise
both the terrorists

998
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:42,490
in the economy section
at the first chance they get.

999
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:50,570
Then...Team 1 will open
the tail end door for Team 2

1000
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:53,110
and you'll all enter
the plane through here.

1001
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:01,490
Team 2 will diffuse the explosives,
and Team 1

1002
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:06,240
will eliminate the position hijackers
in business class and the cockpit.

1003
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:12,950
And what if Plan A fails?

1004
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:14,400
Is there a Plan B?

1005
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,030
Yes.
Army.

1006
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,570
It's impossible to fly
down an Army plane to Dubai.

1007
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:21,530
Pakistani radars will
capture the movement

1008
01:12:21,530 --> 01:12:23,150
and can create problems.

1009
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:25,450
The Army's Poona Horse Unit

1010
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:28,530
is returning from Israel
after a joint exercise.

1011
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:32,820
We've rerouted them to
Dubai through the Gulf of Oman.

1012
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:35,820
The unit will come to the
airport with airport authorities

1013
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:38,450
where it will raid IC-691.

1014
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:39,490
There's a problem.

1015
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:42,450
You'll never get permissions
for Plan A and Plan B.

1016
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:45,240
Plan B is totally disastrous.

1017
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:50,030
Indian Army in Dubai or on any foreign
soil is considered an act of war.

1018
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:51,650
- Absolutely.
- They will never agree.

1019
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:54,450
This is why we're taking you along, sir.

1020
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:56,490
Your plans won't help.

1021
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,570
Take my advice.

1022
01:12:58,570 --> 01:13:01,400
Let the negotiations begin.
Let the Ministry handle this.

1023
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,450
Sir, there are no doubles in chess.

1024
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:08,320
It is my mission, and I will handle it.

1025
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:12,450
Mr. Khan,
PMO has given RAW until sunset.

1026
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:15,360
Let them play their game.

1027
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:17,700
Thank you, sir.

1028
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:23,240
Remember, we agents will travel with the
ministers as their team of diplomats.

1029
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,530
Sunder, you're handicapped.

1030
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:26,530
As you say.

1031
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:29,280
We cannot carry ammunition
or spying devices.

1032
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,610
We will be checked thoroughly.

1033
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:33,610
There's a support group
in Dubai who will help us.

1034
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:38,150
We don't know how much
ammunition the hijackers have.

1035
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:42,280
We're travelling to a country where
the terrain and the Law are against us.

1036
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:45,240
To top it all, it's a race against time.

1037
01:13:45,650 --> 01:13:48,200
We now have only seven hours.

1038
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,360
I repeat, only seven hours.

1039
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:55,400
Our mission is to save 210
hostages who may have lost all hope.

1040
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,900
And the targets are four hijackers.

1041
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:01,400
The odds are against us.
But to hell with the odds.

1042
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,530
Now...India will not bow.

1043
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:06,360
This time they lose.

1044
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:09,110
We board in five minutes.

1045
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:14,240
We heard so much about RAW.

1046
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:17,150
RAW is this, RAW is that.
But what RAW is this?

1047
01:14:17,150 --> 01:14:19,240
They don't even have
an aggressive war cry.

1048
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,860
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

1049
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:23,110
Let me tell you a tragic story.

1050
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:26,820
A newborn puppy asked his mother...

1051
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:29,320
Mom, how did father look like?

1052
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:30,990
His mother replied...

1053
01:14:30,990 --> 01:14:35,240
One day he sneaked up from
the back and quietly snuck out.

1054
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:37,950
RAW is that father, sir.

1055
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,200
Respect, sir.

1056
01:14:41,530 --> 01:14:43,030
I will remember this line.

1057
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:55,110
You guys carry on.
I'll join you.

1058
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:06,030
Hello, MTNL.

1059
01:15:06,450 --> 01:15:07,240
Hello...

1060
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,400
Anshul, did you see the news today?

1061
01:15:10,150 --> 01:15:12,280
Hijackers have taken
the plane beyond Lahore.

1062
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:13,780
I know.

1063
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:17,110
Actually called to tell you
that I am flying out for Embassy work.

1064
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:18,400
- Where?
- Cochin.

1065
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:19,650
How long?

1066
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:22,360
One day. I'll be back tomorrow morning.
But I won't be able to call.

1067
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,950
No pause, no hesitation.
You're telling the truth.

1068
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:28,780
Or I've become an expert in lying.

1069
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:30,400
Listen...

1070
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,280
I love you.

1071
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:33,320
I love you too.

1072
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:34,610
Bye.

1073
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:45,360
Maybe at some point, everyone
will feel the mission has failed.

1074
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,110
But always remember one thing.

1075
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:48,990
It's not over till it's over.

1076
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:53,240
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

1077
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,240
He's asleep.

1078
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:31,320
We're doomed.

1079
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,610
Approaching Dubai.

1080
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:52,900
Well...let's begin
Mission Dastur-e-Impact.

1081
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:06,150
A hijacked aircraft is seeking
permission to land

1082
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,900
It's a hijacked flight, sir.

1083
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:11,900
Seeking permission to land otherwise,
they will crash the flight

1084
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,900
and 210 innocent people will die.

1085
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,820
Yes sir.

1086
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:21,950
691 you've permission to land.

1087
01:17:29,070 --> 01:17:36,240
[speaking foreign language]

1088
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:46,700
[speaking foreign language]

1089
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,780
[speaking foreign language]

1090
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:11,860
Sir, 40 minutes car drive to Dubai.

1091
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:13,780
And there's a suite
booked in Hilton Hotel.

1092
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:15,360
And a clear view of the airport runway.

1093
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:16,700
Good.

1094
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:26,320
[indistinct announcement]

1095
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:29,320
Sir, another flight
seeking permission to land.

1096
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,740
Nothing as of now.

1097
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:34,240
Sir, it's an Indian team of ministers
and diplomats to handle this crisis.

1098
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:36,780
Issue runway 2 and seal the air space.

1099
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:50,360
You must explain to everyone.

1100
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:53,030
You all have diplomatic immunity
for everything barring murder.

1101
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:55,490
- Greetings.
- Hello.

1102
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:57,070
Myself officer Sulehim.

1103
01:19:57,070 --> 01:19:58,650
Please proceed to room on level 1.

1104
01:19:58,650 --> 01:20:01,530
A senior from our intelligence
will soon contact you.

1105
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:03,240
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1106
01:20:04,450 --> 01:20:05,240
Yaa Allah.

1107
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:08,820
Sunder.

1108
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:16,530
Come.

1109
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,240
Did he kill it?

1110
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,490
No, only been tranquillised Unconscious.

1111
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:27,610
This is Dubai.

1112
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:31,650
The innocent are never killed,
and the culprits are never spared.

1113
01:20:31,650 --> 01:20:33,740
You must think twice
before making any move.

1114
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:35,700
Security is everywhere.

1115
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:37,320
The hijacked plane is parked over there.

1116
01:20:39,490 --> 01:20:41,240
What is that construction?

1117
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:44,030
Airport expansion.
It's a direct view of the flight.

1118
01:20:44,030 --> 01:20:45,570
But access is denied.

1119
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:27,240
Come on, get up.

1120
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:30,320
Any cameras here?

1121
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,490
None.

1122
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:34,320
Standard equipment.
Sorry, I couldn't get ammunition.

1123
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,200
There are too many security checks.

1124
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:39,650
We will also require...

1125
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:41,450
Airport design,
exterior routes and other documents.

1126
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:44,240
You'll get all the files
but only for 10 minutes.

1127
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:46,650
I've to deliver these
files back to these desks.

1128
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:48,360
10 minutes are enough.

1129
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:49,280
Sure.

1130
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:52,900
Team, sunset at 6 o'clock.
Set your watches.

1131
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,240
Brother, shall we contact ATC?

1132
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:11,150
Not yet. We'll wait for a while.

1133
01:22:11,150 --> 01:22:12,280
Wait for what, brother?

1134
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,240
Come in, Praji.

1135
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,360
Praji here.

1136
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:22,530
Start procedure.

1137
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:23,650
Copy.

1138
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:26,490
ATC, this is Azaadi.

1139
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:30,360
ATC, come in. This is Azaadi.

1140
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:32,650
Go for ATC.

1141
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:35,740
Listen to our demands carefully
I am going to say this only once.

1142
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:38,900
You better hear this.

1143
01:22:40,450 --> 01:22:43,450
Everyone's doing well till now,
but things can get worse soon.

1144
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,200
- Meaning bad.
- This accent...

1145
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:48,030
I've heard this voice before.

1146
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:51,200
If your security forces try anything

1147
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,030
then three hostages
will lose their life.

1148
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:54,860
Dollar, call headquarters.

1149
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:56,360
If I sense any kind
of threat on the plane...

1150
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:59,030
I want to hear the recording from
the 1979 hijacked flight's BlackBox.

1151
01:22:59,030 --> 01:23:01,110
We'll turn this thing into dust.

1152
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:03,530
Do you want to see?

1153
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:15,780
Explosive Threat! All teams alert!

1154
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,280
Monty.

1155
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,950
Come in.
Come on.

1156
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:31,110
Like it?

1157
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,110
Now listen to me carefully.

1158
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:35,200
Our enmity is not with Dubai.

1159
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:39,200
We want our demands
to be forwarded to India

1160
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,200
and fulfilled on time.

1161
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:44,280
Let me know within the hour
who is going to hear the demands.

1162
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,200
Otherwise,
I'll turn this place into a graveyard.

1163
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:50,280
These bloody fools won't stop shitting.

1164
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:52,950
Even the pipes are choked up.

1165
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:56,110
Get it cleared and send food for me.

1166
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:57,450
Over!

1167
01:23:58,650 --> 01:24:01,200
Azaadi, ATC responding soon.

1168
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:05,610
'It will be very destructive
if you don't agree to our demands.'

1169
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,240
It's him.

1170
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:10,860
Daljeet Singh aka Dodi.

1171
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:12,030
But how is it possible?

1172
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:14,110
He couldn't have boarded
the flight from the Indian airport.

1173
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:16,150
Dodi can't get inside India.

1174
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:19,650
The exchange took place in Lahore.

1175
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:25,820
Mukhtar.

1176
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:31,200
- Mr. Rao.
- Hi, how are you?

1177
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:33,610
Please.

1178
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:36,200
This is Mr. Muktaar,
our senior commanding officer

1179
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,200
Signals Intel Unit, Dubai.
Our close friend.

1180
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,280
And this is Mr.
Khan, Minister for Civil Aviation.

1181
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,650
- Hello.
- Hello. Hello.

1182
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:45,450
- Please, sit down, sir.
- Thank you.

1183
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:52,400
Mr. Rao, I can understand
you're in a critical situation.

1184
01:24:53,070 --> 01:24:56,200
So now, let's have
the pointed conversation.

1185
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:58,950
Tell us what do you want from us.

1186
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:05,110
Our intelligence unit will
execute a covert operation here.

1187
01:25:06,110 --> 01:25:09,780
Any damage done to the Dubai
airport will be immediately compensated.

1188
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:15,950
It's not in my power to
give you what you're asking for.

1189
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:21,650
This can only come from the office
of highest authority of Dubai not me.

1190
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:22,990
I understand that.

1191
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:26,650
But I will definitely try.

1192
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:27,900
Thank you very much.

1193
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:29,990
- Helping others has been this
country's nature. - Excuse me, sir.

1194
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:39,030
Also, Mr. Mukhtar,
before starting negotiations

1195
01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:42,150
we want to ensure that
all the hostages are alive.

1196
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:45,280
Two of our diplomats will
go inside and take a headcount.

1197
01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:47,780
If you want, you can check their IDs.

1198
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:51,950
Yes, sir.

1199
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:57,740
Let me talk to the hijackers, okay.

1200
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:59,110
Thank you.

1201
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,820
Let two guys come.

1202
01:26:12,490 --> 01:26:14,240
Okay, Mukhtar. Thank you.

1203
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:17,240
Dollar, Saand, you two are going.

1204
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,740
Dodi has seen my face.

1205
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,200
Chacha Chaudhary's brain
is working faster than...

1206
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:21,990
Shut up, Chacha Chaudhary.

1207
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:25,030
Stick these in your ears
or you know where I'll put it.

1208
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:47,070
Just one guy.

1209
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:48,150
Only one.

1210
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:50,400
But we said two.

1211
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,780
Our plane, our plan.

1212
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:54,490
Dollar, you go. Saand stays.

1213
01:26:55,990 --> 01:26:57,860
Fine. I am coming.

1214
01:27:04,150 --> 01:27:05,450
Dollar, count the hostages

1215
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:07,740
and check for the position
of explosives and hijackers.

1216
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:12,280
Hurry up.

1217
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:17,150
Shall I start from
eco... economy or business?

1218
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:20,030
He said economy twice,
meaning two guys in the economy.

1219
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:21,490
One in business.

1220
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:24,400
- Anyone in the cockpit...
- Where to?

1221
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,110
One in the cockpit.

1222
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:28,490
Just our bro.
Now hurry up.

1223
01:27:40,110 --> 01:27:42,200
Pucchi, refer to the aircraft design.

1224
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:43,990
Rakesh, tell me where the duct opens.

1225
01:27:43,990 --> 01:27:45,200
Airport blueprints.

1226
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:46,200
- Thank you.
- Here.

1227
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:48,740
In front of toilet A, row 51.

1228
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:53,110
Guys, we're an opening.
Follow my instructions.

1229
01:27:53,110 --> 01:27:54,610
We have to move in.

1230
01:27:54,610 --> 01:27:56,900
What do you mean?
This wasn't the plan.

1231
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:58,740
This is our opportunity, sir.
We have to improvise.

1232
01:27:59,110 --> 01:28:00,860
Saand, enter now.

1233
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:06,490
Dollar, stand by.

1234
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:09,570
As soon as I give the signal,
you've to overpower one hijacker.

1235
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:10,650
Okay.

1236
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:11,990
He'll get us killed.

1237
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:13,820
Sorry.

1238
01:28:17,070 --> 01:28:18,070
Move.

1239
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:24,490
Sat-phone, quickly!

1240
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:37,030
Close the luggage duct! Do it now!

1241
01:28:39,950 --> 01:28:42,860
Close the luggage duct!

1242
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,820
Yes! Yes!

1243
01:28:58,990 --> 01:29:00,780
How did the doors close suddenly?

1244
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,490
Are you done counting? Get out.

1245
01:29:03,490 --> 01:29:05,360
- I am leaving.
- Get out.

1246
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:14,150
An eagle is keeping an eye.

1247
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,740
He's Farhad-Bin-Sultan.

1248
01:29:33,740 --> 01:29:35,200
The Government Official in Dubai.

1249
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:39,030
We received news that you want
to do a covert operation in Dubai.

1250
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:42,990
But in exchange,
we can arrange for anything you want.

1251
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:46,110
Like we'll drop the gold import taxes.

1252
01:29:46,650 --> 01:29:49,030
And open trade routes for Emirates...

1253
01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:50,780
This is Dubai, Mr. Rao.

1254
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:52,740
Dubai.

1255
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:57,570
And the thing Dubai values
the most... are human lives.

1256
01:29:58,200 --> 01:29:59,570
Human lives.

1257
01:30:00,820 --> 01:30:04,200
Do you think we cannot
do a covert operation?

1258
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:08,280
We've the best policemen,
the best army men.

1259
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:13,070
We can raid the plane, but we won't.

1260
01:30:13,990 --> 01:30:16,610
Because even if a single life is lost

1261
01:30:17,110 --> 01:30:19,530
then, the protectors of Dubai

1262
01:30:20,150 --> 01:30:23,820
will never be able
to look INA in the eye.

1263
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:25,200
Even I am...

1264
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:28,860
There will be no bloodshed
on the soil of Dubai, Mr. Rao.

1265
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:33,860
This situation can
be resolved in better ways.

1266
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:36,030
Negotiation.

1267
01:30:36,650 --> 01:30:37,780
So negotiate.

1268
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:47,740
By the way, if there is one country
that should understand non-violence

1269
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,610
it is yours.

1270
01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:53,570
You all come from the land of Gandhi.

1271
01:30:53,950 --> 01:30:54,650
No...?

1272
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:10,490
- Sir, weather sheets.
- Thank you.

1273
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:12,400
- Airport blueprints?
- Yeah.

1274
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:15,240
Wait a minute.

1275
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:17,280
Did you take pictures?

1276
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,740
What are you doing? Take pictures.

1277
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:20,030
Fast.

1278
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,900
Everyone, listen carefully.
This is plan B.

1279
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,400
In 20 minutes,
our commandoes will reach Dubai docks

1280
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,650
in a commercial cargo ship of Etheasm.

1281
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:29,200
This is foolishness.

1282
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:30,820
Didn't you hear what
the Government Official...

1283
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:33,400
Khan sir, the plan is already on.
I can't stop it now.

1284
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:42,610
Boys, 10 minutes.

1285
01:31:49,530 --> 01:31:52,200
Kasiri, call the Airport Police.

1286
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:53,150
Yes, sir.

1287
01:31:57,530 --> 01:31:58,240
Hello.

1288
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:01,200
'There is an Indian ship approaching
Dubai with soldiers aboard.'

1289
01:32:02,490 --> 01:32:03,240
Who are you?

1290
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:05,110
Hello.

1291
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:06,530
Hello.

1292
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,780
Information is correct, sir.
Indian ship verified.

1293
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:19,200
No passage allowed.

1294
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,900
Repeat, no passage allowed.

1295
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:55,950
Shark turning around.

1296
01:32:55,950 --> 01:32:58,200
Plan B terminated.
I repeat, plan B terminated.

1297
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,740
- Santok sir is saying...
- Plan B terminated.

1298
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:08,570
Why are you laughing?

1299
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:10,860
- What now?
- What else?

1300
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:13,820
The Ministry will handle the crises now.

1301
01:33:14,490 --> 01:33:16,200
I'll inform the PM.

1302
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:18,110
We're going for the negotiations.

1303
01:33:18,740 --> 01:33:21,860
If you want to negotiate,
sir, then send us.

1304
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:24,360
It's not safe for you to
enter the aircraft like this.

1305
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:26,860
Right now,
only your presence is not safe.

1306
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:29,820
If we listen to you,
then the hostages will die.

1307
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:33,610
Right now,
you're the threat, not the hijackers.

1308
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:36,030
Yes.

1309
01:33:36,030 --> 01:33:37,110
- Come, Mr. Khan.
- Yes.

1310
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:38,610
- Let's go.
- Come on, get up.

1311
01:33:59,450 --> 01:34:01,820
Everyone move that way.

1312
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:04,490
Come on.
Shanty, make them sit at the back.

1313
01:34:04,490 --> 01:34:06,110
- Come on.
- Everyone in.

1314
01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:28,030
Hey, uncle.

1315
01:34:38,110 --> 01:34:39,530
What are your demands?

1316
01:34:42,990 --> 01:34:43,860
Turn it on.

1317
01:34:45,650 --> 01:34:49,280
Our first demand,
our five comrades are in Indian jails.

1318
01:34:50,150 --> 01:34:53,280
Their names are Rajan Singh,
Balwant Singh

1319
01:34:54,030 --> 01:34:56,650
and the leader of Azaadi Dal Tejpal.

1320
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:59,200
Set them free.
Bring them here.

1321
01:35:03,450 --> 01:35:04,650
Second demand.

1322
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:07,110
We want asylum in London.

1323
01:35:07,110 --> 01:35:08,740
All criminal records wiped.

1324
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:11,110
One million pounds.

1325
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:15,610
If you had listened to us in Lahore
we would've settled for half the amount.

1326
01:35:15,610 --> 01:35:16,820
Now the rate's double.

1327
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:18,200
Third demand.

1328
01:35:18,570 --> 01:35:20,320
We want a British Gulf Stream flight.

1329
01:35:20,650 --> 01:35:21,900
Straight to London.

1330
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:24,650
The entire crew should be British.

1331
01:35:25,490 --> 01:35:27,030
Fulfil them by 5:30...

1332
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:28,860
Or else...

1333
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,450
I've a request.

1334
01:35:31,450 --> 01:35:33,110
I see. What is it?

1335
01:35:34,450 --> 01:35:36,200
Can you let the old
folks and children go?

1336
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:38,200
I can free them for good.

1337
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:40,900
I can do that.

1338
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:48,900
Wait a second.

1339
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:51,030
Where to?

1340
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:53,320
- One of you stay.
- What?

1341
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:55,450
Meaning you're our lottery ticket.

1342
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,490
You see, your madam Prime
Minister doesn't have a great record.

1343
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,820
Whether civilian lives
matter to her or not

1344
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:04,360
but the Minister's
life certainly will.

1345
01:36:06,150 --> 01:36:07,200
What say, Monty?

1346
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:08,950
Right said, bro.

1347
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:12,110
He's clever.

1348
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:15,110
He'll bring RAW to his knees.

1349
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:24,990
What happened, sir?

1350
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:31,320
Everything is over.

1351
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:37,200
Thank you for your help.

1352
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:39,200
Don't say that, sir.

1353
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,610
I can try and buy more
time if you want with the files.

1354
01:36:41,610 --> 01:36:43,070
- I'll try.
- We're done here.

1355
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,070
Return the file to ATC.

1356
01:36:46,610 --> 01:36:48,860
I don't want them to grow
suspicious of you and your job...

1357
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:50,150
Sir... Job?

1358
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:53,150
To hell with the job, sir.

1359
01:36:53,150 --> 01:36:55,200
But I do not want you guys to lose.

1360
01:36:55,450 --> 01:36:57,650
There must be a solution. Just try.

1361
01:36:57,650 --> 01:36:59,950
We tried and lost.

1362
01:37:00,530 --> 01:37:01,450
It's finished.

1363
01:37:04,490 --> 01:37:06,110
If you really want to help

1364
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:08,450
then get us access to
the under-construction terminal.

1365
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:11,320
I want to see the passengers are safe.

1366
01:37:13,450 --> 01:37:14,900
- That's it.
- I'll try, sir.

1367
01:37:24,030 --> 01:37:27,610
'We're going to see it's starting
to cloud over the coming days.'

1368
01:37:27,950 --> 01:37:30,320
'So let's take a look at
the currents and temperature.'

1369
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:33,900
'We're expecting a high
possibility of a sandstorm today.'

1370
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:37,200
Stop ogling at her
and switch to the news.

1371
01:37:37,650 --> 01:37:41,820
'The Minister for External Affairs
and the Government Official'

1372
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:44,200
'carried out the negotiations
with the hijackers.'

1373
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:47,530
'as we report seven
terrorists have been released'

1374
01:37:47,530 --> 01:37:49,530
'and put on a Dubai based flight.'

1375
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:53,070
Bravo.

1376
01:37:53,070 --> 01:37:55,200
The dream of Gajba-e-Hind
will come true.

1377
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:58,200
Kaziri, order something special.

1378
01:37:58,200 --> 01:37:59,320
Seafood.

1379
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:03,570
Weather report, sir.

1380
01:38:08,530 --> 01:38:12,200
One million pounds and a
charter flight with a British crew

1381
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:14,030
is on the way from Abu Dhabi.

1382
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:15,740
Anything else, Indira?

1383
01:38:15,740 --> 01:38:17,200
This will be all, Margret.

1384
01:38:17,780 --> 01:38:19,070
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

1385
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:24,110
It's over.

1386
01:38:29,610 --> 01:38:30,530
Ma'am...

1387
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:40,950
It's not over till it's over.

1388
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:15,900
Yes, sir.

1389
01:39:18,610 --> 01:39:20,610
Tejpal's coming.
They released him.

1390
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:23,990
Shanty...

1391
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:30,320
Aunty, stop it.

1392
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:32,400
God's answered your prayers.

1393
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:33,950
He spared your life.

1394
01:39:34,780 --> 01:39:36,400
He's the saviour.

1395
01:39:37,570 --> 01:39:38,320
Come on.

1396
01:39:39,110 --> 01:39:41,110
Wear these staff uniforms, come on.

1397
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:45,740
Hurry up. The exchange
will soon begin at the bridge.

1398
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:48,900
There's isn't going to be any exchange.

1399
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:50,820
What?

1400
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:52,950
The eagle is not outside.

1401
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:55,200
The eagle is inside.

1402
01:39:57,030 --> 01:39:58,110
Within us.

1403
01:40:00,650 --> 01:40:02,530
In front of toilet A, row 51.

1404
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:05,070
If the information is correct,
we've a deal.

1405
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:06,200
Close the luggage duct!

1406
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:08,400
Enemy soldiers in boat.

1407
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:13,070
Go and change.

1408
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:35,990
Tie her up.

1409
01:40:38,070 --> 01:40:40,110
Take those scarfs and goggles.
We'll need them.

1410
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:17,490
We got our freedom, brother.

1411
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:20,110
- Dodi...
- Tejpal, brother.

1412
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:06,950
CT-2 arriving. Direct it to runway 2.

1413
01:42:13,650 --> 01:42:14,820
Azaadi, come in.

1414
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:16,990
Your flight to London
is ready to board on runway 2.

1415
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:20,360
They lose all the time.

1416
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:22,150
Correct, bro.

1417
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:23,900
Come on.

1418
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:38,860
Check the chartered flight.

1419
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:41,740
If there's no danger,
we'll release these three as well.

1420
01:42:44,610 --> 01:42:45,990
Where are you taking me?

1421
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:58,200
- Yes sir.
- Go.

1422
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:13,650
Mom always said always have
a backup for your backup.

1423
01:43:35,070 --> 01:43:37,700
Our mission will only be
over after we take off from here.

1424
01:43:37,700 --> 01:43:38,450
Okay.

1425
01:43:38,450 --> 01:43:40,450
And for that,
we have four and a half minutes.

1426
01:43:52,530 --> 01:43:54,200
Set your watches...now!

1427
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:05,110
The sandstorm was supposed
to hit at 5:30am, not pm.

1428
01:44:06,030 --> 01:44:07,650
Fulfil them by 5:30...

1429
01:44:09,110 --> 01:44:10,200
Or else...

1430
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:12,860
Somebody has changed it.

1431
01:44:41,150 --> 01:44:43,360
Turn on the wipers and the headlights.

1432
01:44:48,150 --> 01:44:49,360
Turn on the lights.

1433
01:44:50,990 --> 01:44:53,530
Look, there. Stay behind them.
Turn on the lights.

1434
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:00,320
This way...

1435
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:02,700
What are you doing, fool?

1436
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:17,030
Lookout.

1437
01:45:36,150 --> 01:45:37,150
Did you kill him?

1438
01:45:37,150 --> 01:45:38,610
No, tranquillised him.

1439
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:13,400
Oh no!

1440
01:46:14,530 --> 01:46:16,570
Faster. Drive faster.

1441
01:46:25,990 --> 01:46:27,860
He's my favourite monkey.

1442
01:46:28,990 --> 01:46:30,110
Why you...

1443
01:46:41,530 --> 01:46:43,030
Bloody...

1444
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:46,360
The car isn't starting.

1445
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:48,200
Why isn't it starting up?
Start the car quickly.

1446
01:46:50,450 --> 01:46:51,490
Move.

1447
01:46:56,950 --> 01:46:58,200
You dog!

1448
01:47:20,610 --> 01:47:22,150
Keep looking at Monty.

1449
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,110
You drove us straight in the sand.

1450
01:47:31,110 --> 01:47:32,780
Reverse. Press the clutch.

1451
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:34,070
Jam on the accelerator.

1452
01:47:34,070 --> 01:47:35,450
Reverse the car.

1453
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:41,900
That way. Let's go that way.

1454
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:07,990
Why is his car move moving?

1455
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:09,490
Signal him.

1456
01:48:14,990 --> 01:48:16,280
He isn't moving.

1457
01:48:16,610 --> 01:48:18,650
Stop next to him.

1458
01:48:53,990 --> 01:48:54,950
Where did he disappear?

1459
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:21,650
Suffocation.

1460
01:49:21,650 --> 01:49:23,280
Difficulty in breathing.

1461
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:26,280
Dragging a person
that's already suffering.

1462
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:29,070
Remember.
Remember.

1463
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:37,700
Yes.

1464
01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:38,950
Who?

1465
01:49:38,950 --> 01:49:41,110
RAW. You must have heard of us.

1466
01:49:42,030 --> 01:49:43,110
Sir.

1467
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:46,450
Raw fish with salad.
As you asked for.

1468
01:49:48,450 --> 01:49:51,110
Shove it up your back!
They got them!

1469
01:49:51,570 --> 01:49:53,320
I wish you had seen
the weather report...

1470
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:54,740
Shut up!

1471
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:13,280
Sir.

1472
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:15,030
Sir.

1473
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:19,740
ATC, seeking permission to take off.

1474
01:50:20,070 --> 01:50:22,150
This is the Government Official, Dubai.

1475
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:24,150
Permission denied.

1476
01:50:24,150 --> 01:50:26,740
If you try to take off,
we will shoot you down.

1477
01:50:27,150 --> 01:50:28,320
Did you hear that?

1478
01:50:28,610 --> 01:50:30,740
- Sir, I...
- You betrayed us.

1479
01:50:31,030 --> 01:50:32,820
You have betrayed us.

1480
01:50:32,820 --> 01:50:34,740
With all due respect.

1481
01:50:35,740 --> 01:50:37,490
Saving lives is not betrayal, sir.

1482
01:50:38,700 --> 01:50:41,280
Putting innocent lives in
danger for your personal interest...

1483
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:43,740
That's betrayal.

1484
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:47,650
Bringing the culprit
to justice isn't betrayal.

1485
01:50:48,860 --> 01:50:51,030
Siding with injustice is betrayal

1486
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:53,990
which was happening
at your airport's help desk D.

1487
01:50:54,610 --> 01:50:56,570
No, he is lying.

1488
01:50:57,030 --> 01:50:59,950
Please check her desk, call
records and bank account trails, sir.

1489
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:02,030
She is dealing with ISI.

1490
01:51:02,570 --> 01:51:05,610
If I am wrong, I'll come back to Dubai.

1491
01:51:05,950 --> 01:51:07,650
At the time of your choosing

1492
01:51:07,650 --> 01:51:09,650
and you can try me as per your Law.

1493
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:12,610
You said there will be
no bloodshed on Dubai's soil.

1494
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:15,280
We didn't shed a single drop, sir.

1495
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:17,990
Sir, you said we come
from the land of Gandhi.

1496
01:51:17,990 --> 01:51:20,610
I humbly add, sir.
We also come from the land of Bose.

1497
01:51:21,070 --> 01:51:23,530
Whatever we did was so
we can look INA in the eye again.

1498
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:30,530
Let them depart.

1499
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:34,990
Permission granted CT-2.

1500
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:36,530
You can take off.

1501
01:51:41,530 --> 01:51:43,200
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

1502
01:51:46,150 --> 01:51:48,110
Today you've proven
what a great nation can do.

1503
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:50,950
Also, thank you to your weathermen, sir.

1504
01:51:52,570 --> 01:51:54,030
They are really accurate.

1505
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:56,700
Thank you again.

1506
01:51:57,610 --> 01:51:59,150
Can I know your name?

1507
01:52:01,490 --> 01:52:02,650
Protocol, sir.

1508
01:52:03,530 --> 01:52:06,530
But you can call me Bell Bottom. Over.

1509
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:17,280
Madam, operation Mirage is successful.

1510
01:52:17,700 --> 01:52:20,400
They are not just bringing
back the seven terrorists we released

1511
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:22,280
but also the four hijackers.

1512
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:47,320
Bloody fools.

1513
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:27,990
- Well done.
- Thank you, sir.

1514
01:53:28,650 --> 01:53:29,570
Great job.

1515
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:31,280
Your support group
almost got us killed, sir.

1516
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:33,740
- I am really sorry about that.
- It's alright.

1517
01:53:34,150 --> 01:53:35,280
Don't get us killed next time.

1518
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:37,070
IC-691 landing on runway 1.

1519
01:53:37,070 --> 01:53:40,280
IC-691 landing. Keep medical assistance,
food, water ready.

1520
01:53:53,610 --> 01:54:08,990
"My home is lonely without you."

1521
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:15,070
"The empty walls...search for you."

1522
01:54:15,070 --> 01:54:20,070
"Looking at the empty window pains."

1523
01:54:20,070 --> 01:54:29,360
"The path you will return on..."

1524
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:33,700
"You will return."

1525
01:54:34,610 --> 01:54:39,360
"You will return."

1526
01:54:39,820 --> 01:54:44,570
"You will return."

1527
01:54:45,110 --> 01:54:49,360
"You will return."

1528
01:55:19,030 --> 01:55:23,490
"You will return."

1529
01:55:24,950 --> 01:55:26,030
Where are you coming from?

1530
01:55:26,030 --> 01:55:27,570
Cochin, as I said?

1531
01:55:27,820 --> 01:55:29,280
Breakfast. Stuffed bread and buttermilk.

1532
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:31,030
Shall we? Together.

1533
01:55:31,030 --> 01:55:32,280
I made Pinnies.

1534
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:33,610
Made them or bought them?

1535
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:35,450
Sindhi Sweets, Chandni Chowk.

1536
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:37,150
Go serve breakfast.

1537
01:55:40,570 --> 01:55:41,400
Hello.

1538
01:55:42,070 --> 01:55:43,200
How is he?

1539
01:55:43,650 --> 01:55:45,070
Says I just returned from Cochin.

1540
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:51,950
Sometimes I want to...fire him.

1541
01:55:51,950 --> 01:55:54,030
Or transfer him to the Andamans.

1542
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:58,030
But unfortunately,
he's bloody brilliant.

1543
01:55:58,530 --> 01:56:01,030
Like a serpent coiled around you.
You can't keep it or throw it.

1544
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:06,320
By the way, thank you for
spotting a talent like Anshul.

1545
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:08,650
Do you know I like agents who are...

1546
01:56:08,650 --> 01:56:10,280
Personally invested in the case.

1547
01:56:10,610 --> 01:56:12,110
I'll have to bear with him now.

1548
01:56:13,030 --> 01:56:14,150
Thank you.

1549
01:56:14,150 --> 01:56:15,150
Thank you, sir.
