Captain, there's a
medical emergency

17
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,643
Want the name tattooed?
Get the car

18
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,810

19
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:56,518
Yes, yes, but via Vasant Vihar

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,018
Chatur called. Remember him?

25
00:04:20,851 --> 00:04:22,060
The 'Silencer'?

26
00:04:22,268 --> 00:04:23,268
Yeah

27
00:04:24,935 --> 00:04:26,685
He said Rancho is coming

28
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,935
What?

29
00:04:30,018 --> 00:04:33,685
He said - Come to the campus at 8.
On the tank

30
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,310
Oh shucks!

31
00:04:36,393 --> 00:04:37,393
Hurry!

32
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:38,601
OK

00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:46,893
Honey, I'll be back soon.
Oh, shoes

34

Tell me later - bye

37
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:57,310
You forgot your pants

38
00:05:07,768 --> 00:05:08,768

Forgot my socks

42
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,393
More than just your socks

43
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:18,268
Your pants

44
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
Oh no

45
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,101
Now get my brother

00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,435
Same last name - Dhillon

47
00:05:36,643 --> 00:05:40,185
This is Dhillon.
Where's my cab? On the runway?

48
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:01,726
Hey Rancho

49
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,351
Hey Chatur, where's Rancho?

50
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:05,310

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,851
Welcome, idiots

53
00:06:14,393 --> 00:06:15,560
Some 'madeira' for you?

54
00:06:17,018 --> 00:06:20,310
The same rum you
guzzled those days

55
00:06:21,185 --> 00:06:22,226
Have a drink

56
00:06:23,018 --> 00:06:24,101
Where is Rancho?

57
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:27,643
Patience. First look at this

58
00:06:29,226 --> 00:06:32,310
Don't eye my wife. Check out

64
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:48,810
Why're you showing us all this?

65
00:06:49,518 --> 00:06:50,518
Forgot?

66
00:06:53,643 --> 00:06:54,643
What's this?

00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,893
'5th September'. Today's date

68
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,518
I challenge you

69

We'll meet again after ten years

70
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:21,310
Same day. Same place

71
00:07:21,893 --> 00:07:24,560
We'll see who's more successful

72
00:07:25,018 --> 00:07:29,643
Have the balls? C'mon, bet!

73
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,310
Remember? I'd challenged
that idiot right here

74
00:07:35,851 --> 00:07:38,935
I kept my promise. I'm back

75
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,850
Jackass! I aborted a flight,
he forgot his pants

76
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:44,935
all to meet Rancho

77
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:47,976
5 years we've searched.
Don't know if he's alive

78
00:07:48,143 --> 00:07:50,768
and you think he'll show up
for your silly bet

79
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:55,101
I know he won't show up

80
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,601
You gonna break his jaw
or should I

81
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:00,810
So why'd you call us here?

82
00:08:00,976 --> 00:08:02,185
To meet Rancho

83
00:08:02,643 --> 00:08:06,726
Come and see where I've reached
and where he rots

84
00:08:06,935 --> 00:08:08,268
So you know where Rancho is?

85

Yes

86
00:08:12,935 --> 00:08:13,935

00:15:48,018 --> 00:15:52,518
I'll do 'urine-expulsion'
on your door all semester

185
00:15:56,393 --> 00:15:57,393
One

186
00:16:00,435 --> 00:16:01,768
Two

187
00:16:08,226 --> 00:16:09,268
Three

188
00:16:19,768 --> 00:16:21,143
Four

189
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,351
Five

190
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:33,893
Six

191
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:41,393
Seven

192
00:16:47,935 --> 00:16:49,018
Eight

193
00:16:54,185 --> 00:16:55,351
Nine

194
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:06,060
Ten

195
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:56,393
<i>Salt water is a great conductor
of electricity. 8th Grade Physics</i>

196
00:17:57,018 --> 00:17:59,601
<i>We had studied it. He applied it</i>

197
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:08,851
<i>Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe
was the Director of ICE</i>

198
00:18:09,351 --> 00:18:12,351
<i>Students called him Virus,
computer Virus</i>

199
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,310
Virus on the way, with eggs

200
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:19,101
Freshmen are summoned.
Come quickly

201
00:18:19,435 --> 00:18:21,976
<i>Virus was the most competitive
man we had ever seen</i>

202
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,351
<i>He couldn't bear anyone
getting ahead of him</i>

203
00:18:30,101 --> 00:18:33,351
<i>To save time,
his shirts had Velcro</i>

204
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:35,018
<i>and his ties had hooks</i>

205
00:18:37,518 --> 00:18:41,601
<i>He'd trained his mind to write
with both hands simultaneously</i>

206
00:18:45,268 --> 00:18:49,310
<i>Everyday at 2 p.m. he took a
7½ minute power nap</i>

207
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:50,976
<i>with an opera as lullaby</i>

208
00:18:54,226 --> 00:18:55,643
<i>Govind, his valet, had instructions</i>

209
00:18:55,893 --> 00:19:01,893
<i>to carry out all unproductive tasks
such as shaving, nail-cutting etc</i>

210
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:21,600
- What is this?
- Sir, nest

211
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:24,017
- Whose?
- A koel bird's nest, sir

212
00:19:24,018 --> 00:19:25,018
Wrong

213
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,893
A koel bird never makes
her own nest

214
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:31,435
She lays her eggs in other nests

215
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:36,310
And when they hatch,
what do they do?

216
00:19:38,268 --> 00:19:43,893
They push the other eggs
out of the nest

217
00:19:47,893 --> 00:19:48,893
Competition over

218
00:19:50,226 --> 00:19:53,726
Their life begins with murder.
That's nature

219
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,143
Compete or die

220
00:19:59,018 --> 00:20:01,226
You also are like the koel birds

221
00:20:05,643 --> 00:20:09,935
And these are the eggs
you smashed to get into ICE

222
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:15,393
Don't forget, ICE gets
400,000 applications a year

223
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:19,935
and only 200 are selected - You!

224
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:25,185
And these? Finished. Broken eggs

225
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,810
My son... he tried for three years

226
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,226
Rejected. Every time

227
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:38,185
Remember, life is a race

228
00:20:39,226 --> 00:20:42,435
If you don't run fast,
you'll get trampled

229
00:20:43,185 --> 00:20:45,018
Let me tell you a
very interesting story

230
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:48,560
This is an astronaut pen

231
00:20:49,893 --> 00:20:52,476
Fountain pens and ballpoint pens
don't work in outer space

232
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:57,560
So scientists spent
millions to invent this pen

233
00:20:58,018 --> 00:21:02,226
It can write at any angle, in any
temperature, in zero gravity

234
00:21:02,643 --> 00:21:04,393
One day, when I was a student

235
00:21:04,768 --> 00:21:06,435
the Director of our institute
called me

236
00:21:06,893 --> 00:21:09,143
He said, 'Viru Sahastrabuddhe.'
I said, 'Yes sir'

237
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,726
'Come here!' I got scared

238
00:21:12,143 --> 00:21:13,310
He showed me this pen

239
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:17,060
He said, 'This is a
symbol of excellence'

240
00:21:18,893 --> 00:21:19,893
'I give it to you'

241
00:21:21,685 --> 00:21:25,643
'When you come across an
extraordinary student like yourself

242
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:27,935
...pass it onto him'

243
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:33,351
For 32 years, I've been
waiting for that student

244
00:21:33,768 --> 00:21:34,893
But no luck

245
00:21:37,518 --> 00:21:39,726
Anyone here, who'll strive
to win this pen?

246
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:44,435
Good. Put your hands down

247
00:21:49,185 --> 00:21:51,518
Shall I post it on the notice board?
Hands down

248
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,310
One question, sir

249
00:21:54,935 --> 00:21:58,268
Sir, if pens didn't work
in outer space

250
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,435
why didn't the astronauts
use a pencil?

251
00:22:03,226 --> 00:22:04,351
They'd have saved millions

252
00:22:17,393 --> 00:22:18,810
I will get back to you on this

253
00:22:22,893 --> 00:22:25,101
He zaps a Senior's privates
at night

254
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,560
fingers the Director in the day.
Best avoid him

255
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,810
You deflated Virus's erection

256
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,851
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering

257
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,435
Buzz off. You don't have school?

258
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,475
Who'll pay for it? Your pop?

259
00:22:39,476 --> 00:22:42,768
- Keep off my dad!
- Relax

260
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:46,768
For school you don't need
tuition money, just a uniform

261
00:22:47,018 --> 00:22:52,393
Pick a school,
buy the uniform, slip into class

262
00:22:53,143 --> 00:22:54,685
In that sea of kids,
no one will notice

263
00:22:55,351 --> 00:22:58,101
If I get caught?
Then new uniform, new school

264
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,476
<i>See that? - He was different...</i>

265
00:23:01,018 --> 00:23:04,143
<i>He challenged conventions
at every stage</i>

266
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,476
<i>A free-spirited bird had
landed in Virus's nest</i>

267
00:23:08,435 --> 00:23:11,268
<i>We were robots, blindly following
our professors' commands</i>

268
00:23:11,976 --> 00:23:14,518
<i>He was the only one
who was not a machine</i>

269
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,143
What is a machine?

270
00:23:22,518 --> 00:23:24,101
Why're you smiling?

271
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,310
Sir, to study Engineering
was a childhood dream

272
00:23:29,185 --> 00:23:31,601
I'm so happy to be here finally

273
00:23:32,393 --> 00:23:36,018
No need to be so happy.
Define a machine

274
00:23:37,601 --> 00:23:40,851
A machine is anything that
reduces human effort

275
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,643
Will you please elaborate?

276
00:23:46,268 --> 00:23:51,435
Anything that simplifies work,
or saves time, is a machine

277
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:55,725
It's a warm day, press a button,
get a blast of air

278
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,060
The fan... A machine!

279
00:23:57,768 --> 00:24:00,851
Speak to a friend miles away.
The telephone... A machine!

280
00:24:01,226 --> 00:24:04,101
Compute millions in seconds.
The calculator... A machine!

281
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:06,810
We're surrounded by machines

282
00:24:07,393 --> 00:24:09,851
From a pen's nib to a pants' zip -
all machines

283
00:24:10,226 --> 00:24:12,685
Up and down in a second.
Up, down, up, down...

284
00:24:15,518 --> 00:24:16,976
What is the definition?

285
00:24:17,768 --> 00:24:19,393
I just gave it to you, sir

286
00:24:21,101 --> 00:24:24,601
You'll write this in the exam?
This is a machine - up, down...

287
00:24:25,476 --> 00:24:27,393
Idiot! Anybody else?

288
00:24:28,143 --> 00:24:29,143
Yes?

289
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:31,767
Sir, machines are any combination
of bodies so connected

290
00:24:31,768 --> 00:24:33,448
that their relative motions
are constrained

291
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:35,851
and by which means, force
and motion may be transmitted

292
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:38,268
and modified as a screw
and its nut, or a lever arranged

293
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,060
to turn about a fulcrum
or a pulley about its pivot, etc

294
00:24:41,268 --> 00:24:43,392
especially, a construction,
more or less complex

295
00:24:43,393 --> 00:24:45,392
consisting of a combination
of moving parts, or

296
00:24:45,393 --> 00:24:48,685
simple mechanical elements,
as wheels, levers, cams etc

297
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,060
Wonderful

298
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,726
Perfect. Please sit down

299
00:24:53,018 --> 00:24:54,310
Thank you

300
00:24:55,935 --> 00:24:58,726
But sir, I said the same thing,
in simple language

301
00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:02,893
If you prefer simple language,
join an Arts and Commerce college

302
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,893
But sir, one must get
the meaning too

303
00:25:05,518 --> 00:25:08,518
What's the point of blindly
cramming a bookish definition

304
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,393
You think you're smarter
than the book?

305
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:15,726
Write the textbook definition, mister,
if you want to pass

306
00:25:15,935 --> 00:25:17,643
But there are other books...
Get out!

307
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:19,935
Why?

308
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,143
In simple language - Out!

309
00:25:32,018 --> 00:25:33,018
Idiot!

310
00:25:35,018 --> 00:25:37,476
So, we were discussing
the machine...

311
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:40,101
Why're you back?

312
00:25:41,185 --> 00:25:42,226
I forgot something

313
00:25:42,893 --> 00:25:43,893
What?

314
00:25:44,893 --> 00:25:47,309
Instruments that record,
analyze, summarize, organize

315
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,601
debate and explain information;
That are illustrated, non-illustrated

316
00:25:49,768 --> 00:25:51,643
hard-bound, paperback,
jacketed, non jacketed

317
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:53,892
with foreword, introduction,
table-of-contents, index

318
00:25:53,893 --> 00:25:55,685
that are intended for the
enlightenment, understanding

319
00:25:55,893 --> 00:25:57,518
enrichment, enhancement and
education of the human brain

320
00:25:57,685 --> 00:25:59,768
through the sensory route of
vision, sometimes touch

321
00:26:05,643 --> 00:26:07,560
What do you mean?

322
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:09,101
Books, sir

323
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:12,101
I forgot my books. May I?

324
00:26:12,476 --> 00:26:14,101
Couldn't you ask simply?

325
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,726
I tried earlier, sir.
It simply didn't work

326
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,851
<i>Professors kept Rancho
mostly out... seldom in</i>

327
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,101
<i>When thrown out of one class,
he'd slip into another</i>

328
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:34,560
<i>He said - First year or fourth year,
it's knowledge. Just grab it</i>

329
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,351
<i>He was unlike any of us</i>

330
00:26:37,226 --> 00:26:38,976
<i>We fought for a shower
every morning</i>

331
00:26:39,601 --> 00:26:41,810
<i>He'd bathe wherever
he found water</i>

332
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:43,018
Morning, sir

333
00:26:45,143 --> 00:26:46,560
<i>Machines were his passion</i>

334
00:26:46,851 --> 00:26:51,101
<i>When he spotted them,
he opened them</i>

335
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:52,556
<i>Some he could re-assemble...</i>

336
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,851
<i>some he couldn't</i>

337
00:26:55,768 --> 00:26:58,226
<i>There was another, just like him</i>

338
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,268
<i>Joy Lobo</i>

339
00:27:03,101 --> 00:27:04,726
Sir. Excuse me, sir

340
00:27:05,643 --> 00:27:06,810
Mr. Joy Lobo!

341
00:27:07,768 --> 00:27:10,143
Sir, if I could know the
convocation dates...

342
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,226
Why?

343
00:27:11,227 --> 00:27:13,018
Dad wants to make
train reservations

344
00:27:13,435 --> 00:27:16,893
I'm the first engineer from my
village. Everyone wants to attend

345
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,976
In that case, call your dad

346
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:22,560
Please hurry up.
Don't waste my time

347
00:27:29,185 --> 00:27:30,018
Hello

348
00:27:30,185 --> 00:27:33,185
Dad, the Director wants to
speak to you

349
00:27:33,393 --> 00:27:34,393
Joy!

350
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:36,976
Mr. Lobo, your son won't
graduate this year

351
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,600
What happened, sir?

352
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:41,726
He has violated all deadlines

353
00:27:41,976 --> 00:27:45,810
Mr. Lobo, it's an unrealistic project

354
00:27:46,268 --> 00:27:47,851
He is making some
nonsense helicopter

355
00:27:48,185 --> 00:27:52,768
I suggest you don't book
your tickets. I'm so sorry

356
00:27:55,018 --> 00:27:57,393
Sir, I am this close, sir
Is your project ready?

357
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:01,768
Is your project ready?
Sir, see it once, please

358
00:28:01,935 --> 00:28:03,518
Submit it, and we'll consider

359
00:28:03,726 --> 00:28:06,142
Sir, a small extension...
Why, why should I?

360
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:09,226
After dad's stroke,
I couldn't focus for two months

361
00:28:09,393 --> 00:28:10,601
Did you stop eating?

362
00:28:10,976 --> 00:28:12,143
No

363
00:28:12,393 --> 00:28:13,393
Stopped bathing?

364
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:15,310
So why stop studying?

365
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:18,143
Sir, I'm very close.
See it once, please...

366
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,435
Mr. Lobo!

367
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:22,643
Sunday afternoon, my son
fell off a train and died

368
00:28:22,893 --> 00:28:27,893
Monday morning, I taught a class.
So don't give me that nonsense

369
00:28:30,351 --> 00:28:33,060
I can give you sympathy,
not an extension

370
00:28:34,143 --> 00:28:35,726
Sir... I'm very close...

Dude's come up with an
amazing design

384
00:29:58,726 --> 00:30:00,143
A wireless camera atop a helicopter

385
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,643
Can be used for
traffic updates, security... Wow!

386
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,935
But Virus said it's an
impractical design, it won't fly

387
00:30:08,393 --> 00:30:10,226
It will fly! We'll make it fly

388
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,726
Don't tell Joy. It'll be a surprise

389
00:30:15,268 --> 00:30:17,768
We'll fly it up to his window
and capture his reaction

390
00:30:18,393 --> 00:30:20,476
If we work on his project,
who'll work on ours?

391
00:30:21,018 --> 00:30:24,060
Tests, vivas, quizzes -
42 exams per semester

392
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,893
You scare easily, bro

393
00:30:27,685 --> 00:30:31,518
Take your hand, put it over your
heart, and say, 'Aal izz well'

394
00:30:31,768 --> 00:30:33,893
- All is well?
- Aal izz well

395
00:30:34,226 --> 00:30:36,560
Words of wisdom from
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas

396
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,185
We had an old watchman
in our village

397
00:30:39,976 --> 00:30:45,268
On night patrol, he'd call out,
'Aal izz well'

398
00:30:45,976 --> 00:30:49,393
And we slept peacefully.
Then there was a theft

399
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:51,643
and we learned that
he couldn't see at night!

400
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:55,393
He'd just yell 'Aal izz well',
and we felt secure

401
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:01,851
That day I understood
this heart scares easily

402
00:31:02,726 --> 00:31:04,685
You have to trick it

403
00:31:05,935 --> 00:31:11,643
However big the problem,
tell your heart, 'All is well, pal'

404
00:31:12,935 --> 00:31:14,601
That resolves the problem?

405
00:31:14,893 --> 00:31:16,643
No. But you gain courage to face it

406
00:31:19,101 --> 00:31:22,518
Learn it up, bro.
We're gonna really need it here

Take it higher

455
00:35:09,726 --> 00:35:11,351
Look at Silencer - the nude dude!

456
00:35:14,851 --> 00:35:16,351
Joy, come out

457
00:35:18,351 --> 00:35:19,935
Come to the window

458
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:21,518
Joy, look outside

459
00:36:15,893 --> 00:36:16,893
Good news, sir

460
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:21,101
The police and Joy's father
have no clue

461
00:36:22,435 --> 00:36:23,726
Everyone thinks this is suicide

462
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:27,143
The post mortem report -

463
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,768
Cause of Death: Intense
pressure on windpipe

464
00:36:30,018 --> 00:36:31,018
resulting in choking

465
00:36:33,768 --> 00:36:37,685
All think the pressure
on the jugular killed him

466
00:36:39,435 --> 00:36:42,351
What about the mental pressure
for the last four years?

467
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:44,471
That's missing in the report

468
00:36:47,185 --> 00:36:48,851
Engineers are a clever bunch

469
00:36:50,351 --> 00:36:53,643
They haven't made a machine
to measure mental pressure

470
00:36:56,143 --> 00:36:57,435
If they had, all would know...

471
00:36:58,685 --> 00:37:00,060
this isn't suicide... it's murder

472
00:37:04,435 --> 00:37:08,185
How dare you blame me
for Joy's suicide?

473
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,893
If one student can't handle
pressure, is it our fault?

474
00:37:12,393 --> 00:37:15,976
Life is full of pressures.
Will you always blame others?

475
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:20,226
I don't blame you, sir.
I blame the system

476
00:37:21,726 --> 00:37:25,851
Look at these statistics -
India ranks No. 1 in suicides

477
00:37:26,601 --> 00:37:29,935
Every 90 minutes,
a student attempts suicide

478
00:37:31,643 --> 00:37:34,518
Suicide is a bigger killer
than disease

479
00:37:34,768 --> 00:37:36,060
Something's terribly wrong, sir

480
00:37:36,351 --> 00:37:38,435
I can't speak for the rest

481
00:37:39,143 --> 00:37:41,223
but this is one of the
finest colleges in the country

482
00:37:41,851 --> 00:37:43,726
I've run this place for 32 years

483
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:47,518
We were ranked 28th.
Now we're No. 1

484
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:49,268
What's the point, sir?

485
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:54,268
Here they don't discuss
new ideas or inventions

486
00:37:56,101 --> 00:38:00,976
They discuss grades,
jobs, settling in the USA

487
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:07,185
They teach how to get good scores.
They don't teach Engineering

488
00:38:07,393 --> 00:38:09,560
Now you will teach me
how to teach?

489
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,060
No sir, I...

490
00:38:14,226 --> 00:38:15,268
Sir, my paper...

491
00:38:34,185 --> 00:38:35,345
Vaidyanathan, please sit down

492
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,935
Here is a
self-proclaimed professor

493
00:38:39,435 --> 00:38:44,101
who thinks he is better than
our highly qualified teachers

494
00:38:44,851 --> 00:38:49,268
Professor Ranchhoddas Chanchad
will teach us Engineering

495
00:39:07,226 --> 00:39:09,518
We do not have all day

496
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:50,726
You have 30 seconds
to define these terms

497
00:39:51,185 --> 00:39:53,185
You may refer to your books

498
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,810
Raise your hand
if you get the answer

499
00:39:57,143 --> 00:40:00,476
Let's see who comes first,
who comes last

500
00:40:01,351 --> 00:40:04,560
Your time starts... now

501
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:35,226
Time up

502
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,685
Time up, sir

503
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,893
No one got the answer?

504
00:40:45,435 --> 00:40:48,768
Now rewind your life by a minute

505
00:40:50,018 --> 00:40:52,810
When I asked this question,
were you excited? Curious?

506
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:55,726
Thrilled that you'd learn
something new?

507
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,935
Anyone?... Sir?

508
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:04,685
No. You all got into a frantic race

509
00:41:06,768 --> 00:41:08,888
What's the use of such methods,
even if you come first

510
00:41:11,143 --> 00:41:14,476
Will your knowledge increase?
No, just the pressure

511
00:41:15,435 --> 00:41:16,995
This is a college,
not a pressure cooker

512
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:22,685
Even a circus lion learns to sit
on a chair in fear of the whip

513
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:27,392
But you call such a lion
'well trained', not 'well educated'

514
00:41:27,393 --> 00:41:28,393
Hello!

515
00:41:28,851 --> 00:41:33,393
This is not a philosophy class.
Just explain those two words

516
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,476
Sir, these words don't exist

517
00:41:36,685 --> 00:41:39,976
These are my friends' names.
Farhan and Raju

518
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,560
Quiet!

519
00:41:54,976 --> 00:41:57,768
Nonsense! Is this how
you'll teach Engineering?

520
00:41:58,268 --> 00:42:00,143
Sir, I wasn't teaching
you Engineering

521
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,226
You're an expert at that

522
00:42:03,101 --> 00:42:06,310
I was teaching you... how to teach

523
00:42:09,185 --> 00:42:11,060
And I'm sure one day you'll learn

524
00:42:12,101 --> 00:42:15,060
because unlike you, I never
abandon my weak students

525
00:42:15,601 --> 00:42:16,601
Bye, sir

526
00:42:18,685 --> 00:42:19,726
Quiet!

527
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,393
Quiet, I said

528
00:42:26,893 --> 00:42:30,226
<i>I regret to inform you
that your son...</i>

529
00:42:30,393 --> 00:42:31,476
<i>Farhan... Raju...</i>

530
00:42:31,768 --> 00:42:32,848
<i>has fallen into bad company</i>

531
00:42:33,185 --> 00:42:36,310
<i>Without urgent corrective steps,
his future will be ruined</i>

532
00:42:37,435 --> 00:42:40,685
<i>Virus's letters dropped on
our homes like atom bombs</i>

533
00:42:41,018 --> 00:42:43,559
<i>Hiroshima and Nagasaki
plunged into gloom</i>

534
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,601
<i>Our parents invited us -
for a dressing down</i>

535
00:42:47,685 --> 00:42:49,810
Come in

536
00:42:52,393 --> 00:42:53,393
See that?

537
00:42:54,726 --> 00:42:57,268
We could afford
just one air-conditioner

538
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:02,685
We put it in Farhan's room,
so he could study in comfort

539
00:43:04,185 --> 00:43:08,101
I didn't buy a car.
I manage with a scooter

540
00:43:09,018 --> 00:43:10,851
We put all our money
into Farhan's education

541
00:43:12,393 --> 00:43:16,476
We sacrificed our comforts
for Farhan's future. Understand?

542
00:43:25,143 --> 00:43:26,476
You took these pictures, Farhan?

543
00:43:28,435 --> 00:43:30,393
He had that useless
obsession for a while

544
00:43:31,393 --> 00:43:33,142
Went around taking
pictures of animals

545
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:35,893
Wanted to be a
wildlife photographer

546
00:43:37,143 --> 00:43:39,518
Son, what was your
score that year?

547
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:41,685
91%

548
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:46,685
Hear that? Straight drop
from 94% to 91%

549
00:43:49,851 --> 00:43:51,268
You find it funny?

550
00:43:51,976 --> 00:43:56,018
No sir, sorry. I'm just
amazed at the photos

551
00:43:56,226 --> 00:43:58,810
Why make him an engineer...
Why not a wildlife photographer?

552
00:43:59,018 --> 00:44:00,143
Enough!

553
00:44:01,435 --> 00:44:06,685
I humbly request you -
Don't ruin my son's future

554
00:44:08,226 --> 00:44:10,560
Food's on the table, boys. C'mon

555
00:44:15,518 --> 00:44:17,768
If you ever visit again,
do eat with us

556
00:44:20,726 --> 00:44:22,143
<i>Dad denied us a meal...</i>

557
00:44:22,768 --> 00:44:24,393
<i>So, to fill our bellies with food...</i>

558
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:28,060
<i>and ears with more reprimands,
we reached Raju's house</i>

559
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:34,101
<i>Raju's house was straight
out of a 50's black and white film</i>

560
00:44:34,893 --> 00:44:35,893
<i>A small, dingy room...</i>

561
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,518
<i>a paralyzed father...</i>

562
00:44:38,351 --> 00:44:39,518
<i>a coughing mother...</i>

563
00:44:39,935 --> 00:44:41,393
<i>and an unwed sister</i>

564
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,893
<i>A sofa sprouting springs...</i>

565
00:44:44,393 --> 00:44:46,643
<i>a 24 hour water supply -
from the leaking roof</i>

566
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,935
<i>Mother was a retired school
teacher and a tireless complainer</i>

567
00:44:51,643 --> 00:44:53,768
<i>Father was once a postmaster</i>

568
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:56,685
<i>Paralysis shut down
his body partly...</i>

569
00:44:57,185 --> 00:44:59,560
<i>his salary completely.
And the sister...</i>

570
00:44:59,768 --> 00:45:03,351
Kammo's turned 28.
They demand a car in dowry

571
00:45:04,018 --> 00:45:06,601
If you don't study and earn,
how will she marry?

572
00:45:07,143 --> 00:45:08,143
Some okra?

573
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,893
Okra is now 12Rs per kilo,
cauliflower is 10Rs.

574
00:45:13,268 --> 00:45:14,643
It's daylight robbery!

575
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:19,018
What will we eat if we get
warnings from your college?

576
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:20,310
Mom!

577
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:22,810
Cottage cheese?

578
00:45:23,226 --> 00:45:26,726
Cottage cheese should be sold
at the jewelers, in velvet pouches

579
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,810
Cottage cheese? No, no, it's OK

580
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,018
Mom, please

581
00:45:31,935 --> 00:45:33,685
Alright, I'll shut up

582
00:45:35,393 --> 00:45:39,851
Earn for the family,
slave like a maid

583
00:45:40,101 --> 00:45:42,351
and then take the vow of silence

584
00:45:43,351 --> 00:45:47,851
If not with my son, with whom
do I share my woes - his friends?

585
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:52,851
Hey Raju

586
00:45:56,435 --> 00:45:57,435
<i>We were in a huge dilemma</i>

587
00:45:58,101 --> 00:46:01,185
<i>Do we comfort our friend
or console his mom?</i>

588
00:46:02,435 --> 00:46:05,351
<i>Screw it, we thought, let's
focus on the cottage cheese</i>

589
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:20,101
Even his eczema cream
costs 55Rs now

590
00:46:24,893 --> 00:46:26,185
Another roti?

591
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,476
No, thank you. We're through

592
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:39,851
Okra for 12Rs.
Cauliflower for 10Rs.

593
00:46:42,935 --> 00:46:44,726
At least you were offered a meal

594
00:46:45,601 --> 00:46:48,435
Unlike your sadistic dad...
'Hitler' Qureshi!

595
00:46:48,601 --> 00:46:51,268
And your mom is Mother Teresa...
Feeding us 'eczema roti'!

596
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,101
Don't poke fun at my mom!
Enough, you guys

597
00:46:55,435 --> 00:46:56,810
I'm famished. Let's eat out

598
00:46:56,976 --> 00:46:59,310
It's month end. Who'll pay?
His Mother Teresa?

599
00:47:00,393 --> 00:47:04,935
To eat out, you don't need money.
Just a uniform. Look...

600
00:47:07,768 --> 00:47:09,393
C'mon - Come

601
00:47:11,018 --> 00:47:13,350
Good evening, good evening

602
00:47:13,351 --> 00:47:14,351
Oh, Uncle

603
00:47:19,518 --> 00:47:22,726
Three large vodkas.
Half soda, half water

604
00:47:22,976 --> 00:47:24,185
If we're caught, we're dead

605
00:47:24,393 --> 00:47:27,017
What's for starters?
Get double portions

606
00:47:27,018 --> 00:47:30,018
Leave this here and start
some peppy music

607
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:32,435
Pia, what the hell!

608
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:35,518
Why're you wearing
this ancient piece of junk?

609
00:47:36,768 --> 00:47:40,310
What'll people say - My fiancée...

610
00:47:40,768 --> 00:47:43,310
a doctor in the making,
wearing a cheap, 200Rs watch!

611
00:47:44,268 --> 00:47:45,726
Please take it off. Thank you

612
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:47,310
Hi handsome

613
00:47:47,476 --> 00:47:50,392
Hey Aunty. You're looking good

614
00:47:50,393 --> 00:47:52,935
Don't miss my set, darling
Rubies?

615
00:47:53,143 --> 00:47:55,850
From Mandalay - Mandalay... Wow!

616
00:47:55,851 --> 00:47:58,518
Hey, let's go meet David
Of course

617
00:48:01,893 --> 00:48:02,893
Excuse me

618
00:48:04,976 --> 00:48:06,101
Yes?

619
00:48:06,435 --> 00:48:07,476
Flowers

620
00:48:09,018 --> 00:48:12,185
- May I take the glass?
- Why?

621
00:48:12,518 --> 00:48:14,768
So you don't break it on my head

622
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,810
Why would I do that?

623
00:48:17,268 --> 00:48:19,351
For the free advice I'll now impart

624
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,560
What?

625
00:48:21,768 --> 00:48:23,310
Don't marry that ass

626
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:25,435
Excuse me?

627
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,226
He's not a human,
he's a price tag

628
00:48:27,685 --> 00:48:30,643
He'll turn your life into a
nightmare of brands and prices

629
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:33,851
He'll ruin your life.
Your future will be finished

630
00:48:34,185 --> 00:48:35,185
Want a demonstration?

631
00:48:37,226 --> 00:48:38,810
Shall I find out
the price of his shoes?

632
00:48:40,393 --> 00:48:42,268
I won't ask.
He'll announce it himself

633
00:48:54,351 --> 00:49:00,268
What the hell...
Mint sauce on my $300 shoes!

634
00:49:00,435 --> 00:49:03,601
Run for your life!
It's free advice. Take it or leave it

635
00:49:04,185 --> 00:49:06,851
Genuine Italian leather -
hand-stitched!

636
00:49:11,476 --> 00:49:14,143
Dad, are they your guests?

637
00:49:17,518 --> 00:49:20,768
My students.
What're they doing here?

638
00:49:24,768 --> 00:49:25,935
Hold on, Dad

639
00:49:27,518 --> 00:49:29,726
These beans smell great

640
00:49:29,893 --> 00:49:32,185
No room for roti Just pile it on

641
00:49:34,185 --> 00:49:35,518
Hi - Hey

642
00:49:37,101 --> 00:49:40,060
That was an eye-opener.
Thank you so much

643
00:49:41,601 --> 00:49:43,851
It was my moral responsibility

644
00:49:44,685 --> 00:49:46,085
Can I ask you for little more help?

645
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:49,768
Dad won't let me break off
this engagement

646
00:49:50,768 --> 00:49:54,726
You explain so well.
Can you give him a demo too?

647
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,643
Certainly. Raju, the mint sauce

648
00:49:58,226 --> 00:49:59,643
You're really sweet

649
00:50:00,893 --> 00:50:03,935
Where is your daddy?
Right behind you

650
00:50:08,601 --> 00:50:10,893
Aal izz well

651
00:50:11,726 --> 00:50:16,851
Run for your life!
It's free advice. Take it or leave it

652
00:50:17,185 --> 00:50:18,685
What're you doing here?

653
00:50:19,351 --> 00:50:22,435
We'll hand these gifts
to the couple

654
00:50:23,518 --> 00:50:25,768
I'll do that for you.
It's my sister's wedding

655
00:50:26,226 --> 00:50:27,351
Sister?

656
00:50:30,226 --> 00:50:32,601
Sir, what's the sum total
of your daughters?

657
00:50:34,226 --> 00:50:35,226
Empty. No gift cheques

658
00:50:35,435 --> 00:50:37,600
Forgot the cheques, Raju
...Farhan?

659
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:41,726
We didn't invite you,
you must be from the groom's side

660
00:50:42,268 --> 00:50:46,185
No sir, we're here as the
emissaries of science

661
00:50:46,351 --> 00:50:48,518
How? Can you explain?

662
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:52,435
Dad, he explains superbly.
I'm sure he'll give us a demo

663
00:50:52,768 --> 00:50:53,768
Won't you?

664
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,101
Well, Delhi has plenty of
power cuts that...

665
00:50:58,393 --> 00:51:00,685
disrupt wedding celebrations

666
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,143
So I thought of making
an inverter that...

667
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,685
draws power from guests' cars

668
00:51:05,935 --> 00:51:07,268
I see

669
00:51:07,518 --> 00:51:08,976
Wow

670
00:51:09,393 --> 00:51:10,768
So where's the inverter?

671
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,185
Sir, the design is ready

672
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:17,560
Where's the design, Farhan?

673
00:51:18,018 --> 00:51:21,018
I gave you the design
I gave it to Raju

674
00:51:21,476 --> 00:51:22,476
Raju, design?

675
00:51:25,518 --> 00:51:29,226
Never mind the design.
I'll make the inverter and show you

676
00:51:29,601 --> 00:51:33,226
You can only invent stories,
not an inverter

677
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,601
I'll make one, I promise

678
00:51:36,976 --> 00:51:40,435
And I'll name it after you.
After all, it was invented...

679
00:51:40,893 --> 00:51:44,351
at your daughter's wedding.
So it'll be an honor...

680
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:50,518
Farhan, Raju. I'll see you
in my office tomorrow

681
00:51:56,435 --> 00:51:59,893
Sir, what was the cost per plate?
We'll reimburse you

682
00:52:00,268 --> 00:52:01,893
...in installments

683
00:52:04,393 --> 00:52:07,601
We'll never crash a wedding again
Not even my own

684
00:52:07,768 --> 00:52:09,976
In fact, I won't even marry.
Nor will he

685
00:52:10,685 --> 00:52:12,685
Uh... right. No marriage

686
00:52:14,226 --> 00:52:16,560
Your parents shouldn't have
married either

687
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:20,768
The world would have
to feed two less idiots

688
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:24,310
Sit!

689
00:52:35,351 --> 00:52:36,351
Pay attention

690
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:52,226
This is Ranchhoddas's father's
monthly income

691
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:59,893
Couple of zeroes less,
and it's still a sizable income

692
00:53:02,476 --> 00:53:08,768
But erase another zero,
and I would worry a little

693
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,393
Isn't that your fathers income,
Farhan?

694
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:15,976
Yes, sir

695
00:53:17,393 --> 00:53:19,393
Now take away another zero...

696
00:53:22,476 --> 00:53:26,226
and that's your family income,
Raju Rastogi

697
00:53:27,435 --> 00:53:28,768
Big reason to worry

698
00:53:33,518 --> 00:53:40,643
Take my advice and shift into
Chatur Ramalingam's room

699
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:45,310
Exams are here. Stay with
Rancho and you're sure to fail

700
00:54:07,268 --> 00:54:09,643
- Want a shave?
- No, sir

701
00:54:09,851 --> 00:54:10,851
Then get lost!

702
00:54:21,976 --> 00:54:27,518
Raju, don't worry. This is Virus's
move to split us. Divide and rule

703
00:54:27,685 --> 00:54:28,726
I have to worry

704
00:54:29,185 --> 00:54:32,643
He grades us, and I need
good grades for a good job

705
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:36,601
Unlike you, I don't have a
rich dad I can live off

706
00:54:36,768 --> 00:54:38,601
Shut up, Raju

707
00:54:38,893 --> 00:54:41,518
Must we follow all his hogwash?
'Aal izz well'

708
00:54:41,935 --> 00:54:43,351
I won't be his flunky... like you

709
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:46,601
You're crossing the line
No, I'm drawing one

710
00:54:47,143 --> 00:54:48,810
I have a family to support

711
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,268
Dad's medicines
swallow up mom's pension

712
00:54:55,268 --> 00:54:59,601
My sis can't marry because
they want a car in dowry

713
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:06,768
Mom hasn't bought a
single saree in five years

714
00:55:09,643 --> 00:55:12,810
Now don't get your mom's
wardrobe into the debate

715
00:55:13,976 --> 00:55:16,016
By the way, how many sarees
per annum is reasonable?

716
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,268
Hey... no wisecracks about mom

717
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:23,268
We'll study with all our heart,
but not just for grades

718
00:55:23,976 --> 00:55:28,268
To quote a Wise One - Study
to be accomplished, not affluent

719
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:34,560
Follow excellence. And success
will chase you, pants down!

720
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:38,393
Which Wise One says this?
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas?

721
00:55:40,476 --> 00:55:41,476
Go rot in the bogs!

722
00:55:43,101 --> 00:55:46,060
Raju, don't stress. We'll top
our class. Nothing is impossible

723
00:55:46,393 --> 00:55:47,518
Oh yeah?

724
00:55:51,226 --> 00:55:53,310
Shove this back into the tube

725
00:55:56,393 --> 00:55:57,976
<i>Raju got onto another train</i>

726
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:03,685
<i>His travails with Chatur began.
Yes, I mean travails, not travels</i>

727
00:56:08,143 --> 00:56:10,018
<i>Chatur was called 'Silencer'</i>

728
00:56:10,393 --> 00:56:14,060
<i>To sharpen his memory,
he popped pills from a local quack</i>

729
00:56:14,518 --> 00:56:16,435
<i>And then let off silent...
but lethal farts</i>

730
00:56:19,185 --> 00:56:22,351
I didn't do it... Raju?

731
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,185
<i>He always blamed others
for the output</i>

732
00:56:25,976 --> 00:56:28,810
<i>Silencer crammed 18 hours a day</i>

733
00:56:29,101 --> 00:56:32,185
<i>On exam eve,
he would distract others</i>

734
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:39,226
<i>His belief - There are only
two ways of topping</i>

735
00:56:39,601 --> 00:56:42,851
<i>Elevate your own grades or
shrink your opponents' grades</i>

736
00:56:47,185 --> 00:56:51,018
<i>Rancho decided to subdue
Silencer and rescue Raju...</i>

737
00:56:51,518 --> 00:56:52,768
<i>with one master plan</i>

738
00:56:54,851 --> 00:57:02,851
Our Director has unceasingly
served... 'Served' means...

739
00:57:02,935 --> 00:57:06,935
Damn the meaning,
I'll memorize it

740
00:57:08,393 --> 00:57:11,976
<i>Chatur was the introductory speaker
at the Teachers' Day function</i>

741
00:57:12,351 --> 00:57:16,226
<i>To impress Virus, he got his
speech written by the librarian...</i>

742
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:17,768
<i>in highbrow Hindi</i>

743
00:57:19,351 --> 00:57:24,685
Hello. Hold on.
Chatur, call for you

744
00:57:25,101 --> 00:57:27,476
Please collect the printout.
I'll be right back

745
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:32,143
Oh... the things I have to do...

746
00:57:35,768 --> 00:57:38,893
Mr. Dubey, the Director was
remembering you

747
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:40,601
- Really?
- Yes. Just now

748
00:57:41,018 --> 00:57:44,351
I'll see him right away.
Give this to Chatur

749
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,560
Hello. Hello
Hello, Mr. Ramalingam?

750
00:57:52,726 --> 00:57:53,726
Yes?

751
00:57:54,226 --> 00:57:56,560
I'm calling from the police station

752
00:57:56,976 --> 00:57:59,768
- Are you from Uganda?
- Yes sir

753
00:58:01,351 --> 00:58:04,351
Your life is in danger
What?... How?

754
00:58:05,518 --> 00:58:07,268
Listen carefully, or else...

755
00:58:07,935 --> 00:58:12,226
you'll get killed as you step out
of the college gate

756
00:58:13,018 --> 00:58:14,226
Why? What happened?

757
00:58:14,393 --> 00:58:15,935
<i>While Chatur was kept engaged</i>

758
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:20,351
<i>Rancho altered a few words
in his speech, for example...</i>

759
00:58:20,601 --> 00:58:22,935
<i>'served' became 'screwed'</i>

760
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:25,060
Yes sir?

761
00:58:25,643 --> 00:58:28,143
- Who are you?
- Dubey. Librarian

762
00:58:30,768 --> 00:58:31,893
I'm permanent staff, sir

763
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,935
Congratulations

764
00:58:34,393 --> 00:58:37,726
Hold on a moment.
The chief is on the other line

765
00:58:38,143 --> 00:58:39,143
Excuse me, sir

766
00:58:48,768 --> 00:58:50,976
Yes... so where was I?

767
00:58:51,268 --> 00:58:53,643
You said I may die...
outside the gate

768
00:58:53,810 --> 00:59:00,185
Right. As you get out of the gate,
you'll see a traffic signal

769
00:59:00,435 --> 00:59:02,435
Traffic signal. OK

770
00:59:02,685 --> 00:59:08,185
When it turns red,
all the cars will halt

771
00:59:08,726 --> 00:59:10,018
OK. Then?

772
00:59:10,185 --> 00:59:12,143
Then cross the road
with great caution

773
00:59:12,935 --> 00:59:18,143
Because son, in rush hour
if a car hits you, you're dead

774
00:59:20,101 --> 00:59:21,893
What nonsense! I know that

775
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:25,601
You know that? Excellent.
Then you're safe my boy

776
00:59:32,685 --> 00:59:34,726
From the librarian, Silencer

777
00:59:34,893 --> 00:59:36,435
You don't call me that, Chanchad

778
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:44,351
Hey. The Director said
he didn't call for me

779
00:59:45,185 --> 00:59:47,393
Who said 'called'?
I just said he 'remembered' you

780
00:59:47,601 --> 00:59:50,143
Remembered? Rascals!

781
00:59:58,226 --> 01:00:00,351
Distinguished Mr. Chairperson

782
01:00:02,685 --> 01:00:06,935
Chief guest, the Honorable
Minister of Education

783
01:00:07,601 --> 01:00:11,518
respected teachers and friends

784
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:17,976
ICE has now soared
beyond the stratosphere

785
01:00:18,643 --> 01:00:22,893
The credit goes solely to

786
01:00:23,351 --> 01:00:27,101
Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe.
Give him a big hand

787
01:00:27,268 --> 01:00:31,268
Sir, the voice is his
but the words are mine

788
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:34,268
He's a great guy, really you are

789
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:43,935
For 32 years, he has
unceasingly screwed students

790
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:48,851
He means - 'served' students

791
01:00:49,143 --> 01:00:51,685
I'm sure his endeavors
will continue

792
01:00:54,393 --> 01:00:59,393
We are astounded at
how one man, in one lifetime

793
01:00:59,643 --> 01:01:02,518
can screw so many, so well

794
01:01:05,643 --> 01:01:10,893
With rigorous training
he's built up his stamina

795
01:01:14,643 --> 01:01:21,226
He's spent every living minute
just screwing

796
01:01:23,851 --> 01:01:25,560
Let's replicate his methods

797
01:01:29,393 --> 01:01:35,018
Tomorrow ICE students
will go across the globe

798
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:41,893
Wherever we go,
we promise to screw

799
01:01:45,976 --> 01:01:49,143
We'll hoist this screwer's flag
all over the world

800
01:01:54,768 --> 01:01:59,518
We'll show the world that
our capacity to screw...

801
01:01:59,893 --> 01:02:01,851
cannot be matched by any student...

802
01:02:02,143 --> 01:02:05,643
anywhere on the planet

803
01:02:13,393 --> 01:02:16,393
Mr. Minister. Good evening

804
01:02:17,018 --> 01:02:24,476
You have given this institution
what it sorely needs

805
01:02:25,268 --> 01:02:26,851
Booty, funds - Bosom

806
01:02:30,476 --> 01:02:32,601
It's booty, stupid. Bosom means...

807
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:36,060
What nonsense! That's insulting

808
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:41,226
Everyone has a bosom,
but it remains pocketed

809
01:02:42,851 --> 01:02:44,810
No one offers it so readily

810
01:02:48,851 --> 01:02:49,851
Vulgar fellow!

811
01:02:49,976 --> 01:02:51,560
You have generously offered
your bosom...

812
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:55,018
to this relentless screwer

813
01:02:58,018 --> 01:03:02,226
Now see how he makes it grow

814
01:03:02,518 --> 01:03:06,726
Is this what you teach here, Director?

815
01:03:14,435 --> 01:03:17,810
On this august occasion,
here's a Sanskrit verse...

816
01:03:17,976 --> 01:03:20,935
Listen to this - the might
of his fart in verse

817
01:03:21,518 --> 01:03:24,018
A good loud fart is honorable

818
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:26,601
'Fart'? Go, Silencer

819
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:29,643
A medium fart is tolerable

820
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:36,518
Softer windbreaks are terrible

821
01:03:39,518 --> 01:03:44,393
And the silent ones unbearable

822
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:57,476
That's what mindless cramming
does to you

823
01:03:57,685 --> 01:04:01,143
Cramming may see you
through four years of college

824
01:04:01,435 --> 01:04:05,226
but it will 'screw' you
for the next 40 years

825
01:04:06,476 --> 01:04:09,060
He still doesn't get it

826
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:19,560
'Medium fart is tolerable'...
Unbelievable!

827
01:04:19,851 --> 01:04:22,476
You're a poet, Rancho.
How did you think of this?

828
01:04:23,935 --> 01:04:27,310
That was fun.
He didn't know what hit him

829
01:04:29,851 --> 01:04:33,143
You swines!
What did I ever do to you?

830
01:04:36,143 --> 01:04:38,143
Sorry man.
Don't take it personally

831
01:04:38,435 --> 01:04:39,643
I will

832
01:04:40,268 --> 01:04:43,101
Chatur Ramalingam
will never forget this insult

833
01:04:43,768 --> 01:04:47,601
I'll think of it every minute,
every second of my life

834
01:04:47,935 --> 01:04:53,268
Sorry man. That was a demo
for Raju - Don't cram blindly

835
01:04:53,643 --> 01:04:55,810
Understand and enjoy
the wonders of Science

836
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:58,435
I'm not here to enjoy Science

837
01:04:58,601 --> 01:05:01,476
So You're here to screw Science

838
01:05:03,185 --> 01:05:06,143
Go ahead. Laugh at my methods

839
01:05:07,268 --> 01:05:11,560
But one day these methods
will bring me success

840
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:14,893
That day I'll laugh and you'll cry

841
01:05:16,351 --> 01:05:20,560
You're on the wrong track again.
Don't chase success

842
01:05:21,476 --> 01:05:23,643
Become a good engineer
and success will chase you

843
01:05:23,893 --> 01:05:28,476
These ideals don't work
in the real world

844
01:05:29,351 --> 01:05:33,310
You take your train, I'll take mine

845
01:05:34,143 --> 01:05:37,393
Ten years from now
we'll meet at the same station

846
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:43,226
Same day. Same place.
We'll see who's more successful

847
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,935
you... or I

848
01:05:46,726 --> 01:05:51,018
Have the balls? C'mon, bet!

849
01:05:51,268 --> 01:05:54,810
It's a challenge

850
01:05:56,143 --> 01:05:57,143
Watch it!

851
01:06:03,685 --> 01:06:04,685
What's he writing?

852
01:06:12,226 --> 01:06:14,476
Don't forget this date

853
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:25,351
I'm not used to
such expensive gifts, Suhas

854
01:06:25,726 --> 01:06:26,935
Get used to them, Pia

855
01:06:27,101 --> 01:06:29,185
You're gonna be
Suhas Tandon's wife

856
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:30,435
Where's the bill, man?

857
01:06:34,935 --> 01:06:35,935
I'll be back

858
01:06:46,226 --> 01:06:47,975
- You changed the speech?
- What?

859
01:06:47,976 --> 01:06:48,976
Don't lie

860
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,393
Um... Yeah

861
01:06:51,643 --> 01:06:54,018
What's your problem with dad?
I have no problem

862
01:06:54,518 --> 01:06:57,310
I'm making an inverter
named after him. Look... Oh

863
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:03,143
Why're you harassing him?

864
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:05,580
'Cause he runs a factory,
not a college

865
01:07:05,726 --> 01:07:09,393
Churning out asses.
Like that one

866
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:15,560
She destroyed it, man

867
01:07:18,976 --> 01:07:20,185
How dare you call him an ass?

868
01:07:20,435 --> 01:07:23,685
He is one!
First Engineering, then MBA

869
01:07:23,851 --> 01:07:25,601
then becomes a banker in the USA

870
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,018
Because it rakes in more money?

871
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:31,810
Life for him is just
a profit-loss statement

872
01:07:32,101 --> 01:07:34,060
He sees profit in you,
so he's with you

873
01:07:34,435 --> 01:07:38,060
Director's daughter, doctor in the
making... Good for his image!

874
01:07:38,393 --> 01:07:39,643
It's not you he cares for

875
01:07:41,935 --> 01:07:43,268
Who do you think you are?

876
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,185
What do you mean
he doesn't care for me?

877
01:07:47,143 --> 01:07:49,101
New watch? One moment

878
01:07:50,351 --> 01:07:52,393
You always need a demo

879
01:07:53,476 --> 01:07:54,476
Hey Suhas

880
01:07:56,476 --> 01:07:58,018
Where were you?

881
01:07:58,476 --> 01:08:00,101
She's looking for her watch

882
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:02,060
What? You lost the watch

883
01:08:02,351 --> 01:08:03,476
Never mind. Get another

884
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:05,060
It cost 400,000!

885
01:08:07,143 --> 01:08:09,060
Mine's just 250Rs
but keeps the same time

886
01:08:09,268 --> 01:08:11,560
Keep quiet... How could
you be so careless, Pia

887
01:08:11,768 --> 01:08:14,851
This callous attitude is
disgusting. It's disrespectful

888
01:08:15,018 --> 01:08:17,560
That was a limited edition watch

889
01:08:17,976 --> 01:08:21,393
Now wear your ancient
piece of junk at dinner

890
01:08:22,768 --> 01:08:24,143
What're you staring at?

891
01:08:27,143 --> 01:08:29,851
Here come the tears!
Real mature, Pia

892
01:08:30,435 --> 01:08:31,643
I can't handle this

893
01:08:32,518 --> 01:08:34,601
Stop crying and look for it

894
01:08:48,143 --> 01:08:51,018
Find another wrist
for this watch... Ass!

895
01:08:57,476 --> 01:09:00,101
Hey, you're awesome.
Called him an ass to his face

896
01:09:00,393 --> 01:09:01,393
Get lost

897
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:03,185
It's too noisy here

898
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,435
She's saying 'Thank you',
I hear 'Get lost'

899
01:09:05,643 --> 01:09:08,435
I said 'Get lost'
Don't get so uptight

900
01:09:08,851 --> 01:09:11,560
Actually, you never
really loved him

901
01:09:12,018 --> 01:09:13,018
What do you mean?

902
01:09:13,268 --> 01:09:18,018
When you see him, do the
winds whisper a melody?

903
01:09:19,601 --> 01:09:21,185
Your scarf flies in slow motion?

904
01:09:22,226 --> 01:09:23,935
The Moon appears gigantic?

905
01:09:24,476 --> 01:09:27,018
That happens in movies, not in life

906
01:09:27,185 --> 01:09:30,185
Happens in life too -
if you love a person

907
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,601
...not an ass

908
01:09:37,018 --> 01:09:41,643
Hello. What?

909
01:09:42,768 --> 01:09:46,226
Oh God! OK, I'm on my way

910
01:09:49,476 --> 01:09:51,475
You're a medical student,
right? Need your help

911
01:09:51,476 --> 01:09:53,143
It's an emergency, please What?

912
01:09:53,685 --> 01:09:56,851
Please come with me.
What's that oath you doctors take -

913
01:09:57,101 --> 01:09:59,726
You'll never deny a patient help...
The Hippocratic Oath

914
01:10:00,435 --> 01:10:02,226
Please help me,
it's an emergency

915
01:10:06,768 --> 01:10:09,893
You gatecrash my sister's wedding,
break off my engagement...

916
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:12,643
my dad is popping
BP pills because of you...

917
01:10:13,185 --> 01:10:14,726
and here I am, helping you!

918
01:10:15,893 --> 01:10:17,060
Unbelievable!

919
01:10:18,268 --> 01:10:22,101
This Hippocratic Oath -
It's really done us in!

920
01:10:26,976 --> 01:10:28,851
Where's Raju, ma'am?
Gone to get a cab

921
01:10:29,268 --> 01:10:30,726
Called the ambulance
two hours ago

922
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,601
In this country,
pizza reaches in 30 minutes

923
01:10:33,851 --> 01:10:34,851
but an ambulance...!

924
01:10:35,018 --> 01:10:37,268
He needs hospitalization.
Urgently

925
01:10:51,435 --> 01:10:52,435
Hey stop!

926
01:10:54,768 --> 01:10:56,976
Move, it's an emergency!

927
01:10:58,643 --> 01:10:59,726
Move... move...

928
01:11:01,726 --> 01:11:02,768
Move... move...

929
01:11:06,851 --> 01:11:08,976
Doctor, emergency!

930
01:11:10,601 --> 01:11:11,601
That's the patient

931
01:11:17,476 --> 01:11:19,518
Keep this. Hey, here's Raju

932
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:21,935
What the hell!
You brought dad on the scooter

933
01:11:23,851 --> 01:11:25,143
Should I've sent him by courier?

934
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,351
No wisecracks on dads profession!
Where is he?

935
01:11:28,976 --> 01:11:30,768
Go ask the doctor

936
01:11:31,768 --> 01:11:34,976
Close call, Pia. A little delay,
we'd have lost him

937
01:11:35,393 --> 01:11:36,893
Glad you didn't wait for an ambulance
and got him on the scooter

938
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:39,810
Call me if there's a problem

939
01:11:48,976 --> 01:11:51,935
Rancho! Thank you...

940
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:56,726
Thanking your buddies!
Silencer teaching you manners?

941
01:11:57,976 --> 01:12:01,018
Didn't he teach you -
A friend is man's greatest bosom?

942
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:05,726
Go on now.
You have an exam tomorrow

943
01:12:06,351 --> 01:12:09,560
Exams we have many...
Dad mostly just one

944
01:12:11,268 --> 01:12:13,518
We won't budge from here
without the Postmaster

945
01:12:14,185 --> 01:12:15,185
Don't worry

946
01:12:22,185 --> 01:12:26,310
Rancho, forgive me. I was scared

947
01:12:26,601 --> 01:12:28,685
It's OK. Quiet, now

948
01:12:31,268 --> 01:12:33,393
Please forgive me

949
01:12:40,018 --> 01:12:44,018
It's OK, calm down.
Go see your dad

950
01:12:44,601 --> 01:12:45,935
And don't go
with that weepy face

951
01:12:52,268 --> 01:12:53,268
Thanks buddy

952
01:13:04,851 --> 01:13:09,601
Natty scooter. Saved a life.
How much does it cost?

953
01:13:09,935 --> 01:13:12,226
Pour some mint sauce
on it. It'll tell you

954
01:13:14,893 --> 01:13:16,768
Hey, happy Independence Day

955
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:18,726
Today isn't Independence Day

956
01:13:19,101 --> 01:13:22,226
For you it is! Now you're free
to wear your mom's watch

957
01:13:22,893 --> 01:13:25,601
No ass can say it's an
ancient piece of junk

958
01:13:27,935 --> 01:13:28,935
Hey

959
01:13:30,768 --> 01:13:32,726
How do you know
it was mom's watch?

960
01:13:34,518 --> 01:13:36,935
At your sister's wedding,
you wore sparkling new clothes

961
01:13:37,768 --> 01:13:38,935
Only the watch was old

962
01:13:39,601 --> 01:13:40,601
What could that mean?

963
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:45,935
You really missed your mom
that day, didn't you?

964
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:49,810
Yes

965
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:52,601
Your mom must've been
really beautiful

966
01:13:55,185 --> 01:13:57,310
Yes. How do you know?

967
01:13:57,601 --> 01:13:58,601
Seen your dad?

968
01:14:00,143 --> 01:14:01,768
'Life is a race. If you don't run fast

969
01:14:01,976 --> 01:14:03,560
you'll be a broken egg
...cuckoo bird'

970
01:14:04,018 --> 01:14:05,018

Hello. Wake up

1014
01:18:30,435 --> 01:18:33,142
- Huh... Postmaster's dead?
- What!

1015
01:18:33,143 --> 01:18:34,601
No, stupid

1016
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:37,351
It's 8.30, your exam is at 9

1017
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:40,393
But we can't leave him alone

1018
01:18:40,768 --> 01:18:43,642
I'm here.
It's a matter of three hours

1019
01:18:43,643 --> 01:18:46,268
Take my scooter.
It's getting late

1020
01:18:46,768 --> 01:18:47,768
Hey...

1021
01:18:52,185 --> 01:18:53,518
Gosh, what an ancient watch

1022
01:19:00,101 --> 01:19:01,101
Go

1023
01:19:19,143 --> 01:19:21,518
Sorry, we're late
It was an emergency

1024
01:19:27,435 --> 01:19:28,518
Settle down there

1025
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:34,310
Sir, they're still writing

1026
01:19:35,768 --> 01:19:37,351
Hello. Time up

1027
01:19:38,226 --> 01:19:40,810
Please, five minutes.
We started half an hour late

1028
01:19:41,018 --> 01:19:42,309
It was an emergency

1029
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:46,560
<i>He glared at us like we'd
asked for both his kidneys</i>

1030
01:19:47,810 --> 01:19:48,935
<i>But we continued writing</i>

1031
01:19:49,935 --> 01:19:52,935
<i>He continued arranging
the answer sheets</i>

1032
01:20:01,476 --> 01:20:02,476
Done, sir

1033
01:20:03,393 --> 01:20:05,976
You're late.
I can't accept these

1034
01:20:06,226 --> 01:20:07,226
Sir, please, sir

1035
01:20:11,643 --> 01:20:12,935
Sir, do you know who we are?

1036
01:20:14,435 --> 01:20:16,226
Prime Ministers son? Even then...

1037
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,601
I will not accept your paper

1038
01:20:20,143 --> 01:20:22,101
Do you know
our names and roll numbers?

1039
01:20:23,435 --> 01:20:24,518
No...

1040
01:20:26,393 --> 01:20:27,517
Who are you?

1041
01:20:27,518 --> 01:20:29,476
He doesn't know - Run!

1042
01:20:31,185 --> 01:20:33,435
Hey, what's your roll number?

1043
01:20:34,268 --> 01:20:38,518
Where the hell are their papers?

1044
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:44,975
O Lord, have mercy

1045
01:20:44,976 --> 01:20:50,726
<i>Today was Results day.
Time to make a deal with God</i>

1046
01:20:50,893 --> 01:20:53,351
Just save my Electronics.
I'll offer a coconut

1047
01:20:53,851 --> 01:20:58,726
Sir Snake, bless my Physics.
I promise a pint of milk per day

1048
01:20:58,976 --> 01:21:02,351
O Mother Cow,
help me pass... have this grass

1049
01:21:02,643 --> 01:21:05,935
I vow: No X-rated thoughts
of girls in my class...

1050
01:21:06,268 --> 01:21:07,685
Watch over my results

1051
01:21:07,935 --> 01:21:11,768
God of Wealth,
I'll offer 100Rs every month

1052
01:21:12,018 --> 01:21:14,601
<i>100Rs won't bribe even a traffic cop</i>

1053
01:21:15,351 --> 01:21:17,143
<i>let alone the Almighty</i>

1054
01:21:18,393 --> 01:21:20,435
Check from the bottom

1055
01:21:21,476 --> 01:21:23,560
You are... last

1056
01:21:25,310 --> 01:21:26,310
And you?

1057
01:21:28,268 --> 01:21:29,685
Second last

1058
01:21:31,310 --> 01:21:32,351
Rancho?

1059
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:37,851
Not there

1060
01:21:39,268 --> 01:21:40,268
My heart sank

1061
01:21:40,893 --> 01:21:45,268
Not 'cause our ranks tanked,
but 'cause our friend flunked

1062
01:21:47,768 --> 01:21:51,435
There's a mistake.
It's not possible. It's injustice

1063
01:21:55,601 --> 01:21:58,476
What's Silencer howling about?

1064
01:21:59,143 --> 01:22:00,143
He got the second rank

1065
01:22:02,435 --> 01:22:03,435
Who's first?

1066
01:22:04,685 --> 01:22:05,768
Rancho

1067
01:22:08,685 --> 01:22:09,685
Rancho?

1068
01:22:12,018 --> 01:22:13,018
Move aside

1069
01:22:17,643 --> 01:22:19,893
<i>We learned a lesson
in Human Behavior:</i>

1070
01:22:20,726 --> 01:22:26,060
<i>Your friend fails, you feel bad.
Your friend tops, you feel worse</i>

1071
01:22:26,810 --> 01:22:31,185
<i>We were sad.
Two others were sadder</i>

1072
01:22:32,476 --> 01:22:36,310
Ranchhoddas Chanchad.
Front row. Right of the Director

1073
01:22:36,976 --> 01:22:39,226
Uday Sinha. Second row. Third seat

1074
01:22:40,185 --> 01:22:43,393
Alok Mittal. Second row. Fifth seat

1075
01:22:45,226 --> 01:22:47,851
Sahili Rao. Third row...

1076
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:50,476
Sir, why this seating
according to rank?

1077
01:22:51,685 --> 01:22:52,893
Any problem with that?

1078
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:57,143
Yes, this grading system is
like a caste system

1079
01:22:57,643 --> 01:23:00,768
A-graders: Masters
C-graders: Slaves

1080
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:04,351
It's not nice, sir
You have a better idea?

1081
01:23:04,976 --> 01:23:09,101
Yes. Results should not be
displayed at all

1082
01:23:09,601 --> 01:23:13,643
Why publicize someone's flaws?

1083
01:23:13,976 --> 01:23:18,976
If your iron count is low,
will the doctor prescribe tonic...

1084
01:23:19,143 --> 01:23:20,560
or air your report on TV

1085
01:23:21,435 --> 01:23:22,476
You see, sir?

1086
01:23:23,101 --> 01:23:24,851
So basically,
what you are saying is

1087
01:23:25,393 --> 01:23:27,153
I should personally go to
each student's room

1088
01:23:28,226 --> 01:23:29,268
and whisper in his ears...

1089
01:23:30,351 --> 01:23:32,850
'You have come first';
'You're second';

1090
01:23:32,851 --> 01:23:34,393
'Oh, I'm so sorry,
you have failed'

1091
01:23:37,435 --> 01:23:41,768
No sir, I mean
grades create a divide

1092
01:23:44,143 --> 01:23:46,060
I've topped, so I'm next to you

1093
01:23:46,351 --> 01:23:48,726
My pals came last,
they're in the back corner

1094
01:23:48,935 --> 01:23:50,435
At least they're in the corner

1095
01:23:50,601 --> 01:23:52,976
More time with you, and
they'll be out of the photo

1096
01:23:54,143 --> 01:23:56,101
They will neither pass,
nor get a job

1097
01:23:56,935 --> 01:24:00,768
They'll get jobs, sir.
There must be some firm that...

1098
01:24:01,268 --> 01:24:03,060
prefers humans to machines

1099
01:24:04,976 --> 01:24:06,768
They'll get jobs. I guarantee

1100
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:11,101
You guarantee it!

1101
01:24:11,351 --> 01:24:12,851
Bet, sir?

1102
01:24:16,268 --> 01:24:17,560
Govind - Yes, sir?

1103
01:24:21,768 --> 01:24:25,018
Even if one of them gets
a job in campus interviews...

1104
01:24:26,268 --> 01:24:27,435
shave off my moustache

1105
01:24:29,310 --> 01:24:31,060
Sir!

1106
01:24:31,393 --> 01:24:34,393
- Happy?
- Smile, please

1107
01:24:35,726 --> 01:24:36,726
Happy, sir

1108
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:44,601
Jackass!
Honking to hide your tooting

1109
01:24:45,185 --> 01:24:47,851
Septic tank! Popping pills again?

1110
01:24:48,143 --> 01:24:50,768
I didn't do it... Raju?

1111
01:24:51,018 --> 01:24:52,725
This is a familiar stink

1112
01:24:52,726 --> 01:24:55,726
He's the sole cause for
global warming

1113
01:25:21,018 --> 01:25:23,601
Toss me your wallet - I'll buy pants

1114
01:25:24,226 --> 01:25:28,351
Take Chatur's suit instead
Don't touch my suit

1115
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,310
Rancho'll recognize you
even in underwear

1116
01:25:31,518 --> 01:25:35,476
Where's this?
If I could read, would I sell peanuts?

1117
01:25:35,726 --> 01:25:38,268
He can't read - But he can speak

1118
01:25:38,518 --> 01:25:42,476
Wait. Do you know a
Ranchhoddas Chanchad?

1119
01:25:42,726 --> 01:25:44,435
Yes, he lives there

1120
01:25:45,143 --> 01:25:50,435
<i>Free as the wind was he</i>

1121
01:25:52,476 --> 01:25:57,851
<i>Like a soaring kite was he</i>

1122
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:01,810
<i>Where did he go...</i>

1123
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:04,268
<i>let's find him</i>

1124
01:26:04,435 --> 01:26:07,142
Chatur, your pills
Thanks. Where were they?

1125
01:26:07,143 --> 01:26:09,643
In the pocket - Hey, my pants!

1126
01:26:09,810 --> 01:26:11,768
Karl Marx says to
share all resources

1127
01:26:13,393 --> 01:26:15,310
Hey, you'll give people ideas

1128
01:26:16,893 --> 01:26:17,893
I want it now

1129
01:26:33,185 --> 01:26:34,268
What happened?

1130
01:26:36,435 --> 01:26:37,601
Rancho's father

1131
01:26:41,143 --> 01:26:43,851
Excuse me, where is Ranchhoddas?

1132
01:26:44,726 --> 01:26:47,101
There he is - Thank you

1133
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:13,435
Rancho... - Yes?

1134
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:17,726
Sorry. We're looking for Ranchhoddas

1135
01:27:18,768 --> 01:27:20,060
I am Ranchhoddas

1136
01:27:20,685 --> 01:27:24,560
No, I mean... 'Ranchhoddas
Shamaldas Chanchad'

1137
01:27:26,018 --> 01:27:28,560
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas
Chanchad. That's me

1138
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:36,310
Ranchhoddas, take care, son

1139
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:57,726
'Ranchhoddas Chanchad'

1140
01:28:04,935 --> 01:28:05,935
Raju

1141
01:28:38,226 --> 01:28:41,810
I'll be in the Guinness Book for
driving Delhi-Shimla in underwear

1142
01:28:41,976 --> 01:28:43,096
That too, for the wrong guy!

1143
01:28:43,601 --> 01:28:47,518
Same name, same degree,
same photo, but a different guy

1144
01:28:48,143 --> 01:28:49,560
What's going on?

1145
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:52,935
How did Silencer get
Rancho's address?

1146
01:28:54,143 --> 01:28:55,143
Good point!

1147
01:28:56,435 --> 01:28:57,810
Hey Chatur, come here

1148
01:29:04,143 --> 01:29:07,476
How dare you open this?
I got this from San Francisco

1149
01:29:07,685 --> 01:29:09,185
Handmade biscuits

1150
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:13,268
Specially for Mr. Phunsukh Wangdu

1151
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,809
Phunsukh Bangdu? Who's that?

1152
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:20,517
Not Bangdu. Wangdu. 'W'.
Phunsukh Wangdu

1153
01:29:20,518 --> 01:29:23,434
Do you know who that is?
He's a great scientist

1154
01:29:23,435 --> 01:29:26,101
400 patents. The world wants him

1155
01:29:27,185 --> 01:29:30,601
Took me a year
to get an appointment

1156
01:29:31,393 --> 01:29:36,934
Once he signs the deal with
my company, I'll be huge!

1157
01:29:36,935 --> 01:29:41,060
Forget Wangdu.
How'd you get Rancho's address?

1158
01:29:41,226 --> 01:29:43,143
You should be thanking
Phunsukh Wangdu

1159
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:47,101
He led me to Rancho, See this

1160
01:29:49,310 --> 01:29:53,850
My secretary was here to fix
an appointment with Wangdu

1161
01:29:53,851 --> 01:29:58,143
She didn't get the appointment.
But I found Rancho

1162
01:29:58,310 --> 01:30:03,975
I checked the Shimla directory
and found Rancho's name

1163
01:30:03,976 --> 01:30:05,601
What happened to his face?

1164
01:30:06,018 --> 01:30:08,310
Plastic surgery
in honor of your visit?

1165
01:30:12,726 --> 01:30:14,518
Only one man has the answer

1166
01:30:15,143 --> 01:30:19,768
Sorry Papa,
I couldn't fulfill your last wish

1167
01:30:21,268 --> 01:30:25,018
You kept asking me
to take you on pilgrimage

1168
01:30:25,976 --> 01:30:28,435
But I waited
for the highway tender

1169
01:30:29,976 --> 01:30:34,393
There the tender opened,
here you closed your eyes

1170
01:30:38,518 --> 01:30:42,976
I am so sorry, Papa.
I could not be a good son...

1171
01:30:43,185 --> 01:30:44,476
Wrong

1172
01:30:44,976 --> 01:30:47,768
You're an engineer.
Your degree's on the wall!

1173
01:30:48,101 --> 01:30:49,351
You were a very good son

1174
01:30:52,018 --> 01:30:56,726
How dare you barge in?
I'll have you arrested

1175
01:30:56,935 --> 01:31:00,101
No, you'll be arrested.
We've made inquiries

1176
01:31:00,435 --> 01:31:03,476
You use the degree
to clinch contracts

1177
01:31:03,976 --> 01:31:07,185
It's our friend's degree.
How did you get it?

1178
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:24,185
This is a 150 acre estate

1179
01:31:24,643 --> 01:31:27,810
If I shoot and bury you,
no one would even notice

1180
01:31:28,185 --> 01:31:29,185
Get the point?

1181
01:31:30,435 --> 01:31:31,435
Now get lost

1182
01:31:36,893 --> 01:31:41,143
I'm taking Papa's ashes to the
sacred river. Can take yours too

1183
01:31:48,643 --> 01:31:50,185
Grab Papa!

1184
01:31:53,143 --> 01:31:54,226
Here, here

1185
01:31:58,393 --> 01:31:59,393
Let go of Papa!

1186
01:32:02,351 --> 01:32:05,143
Tell the truth or
Papa is flushed!

1187
01:32:05,310 --> 01:32:08,185
Hand over Papa
Papa goes to the sacred sewer

1188
01:32:08,935 --> 01:32:12,226
Get Papa out of the potty
You pull trigger, I pull flush.

1189
01:32:12,393 --> 01:32:13,767
I'll count to three

1190
01:32:13,768 --> 01:32:17,476
Wanna shoot us?
Raju, scatter the ashes

1191
01:32:20,185 --> 01:32:21,185
One

1192
01:32:21,351 --> 01:32:26,060
Take us down,
and Papa's down the drain

1193
01:32:27,351 --> 01:32:28,351
Two

1194
01:32:28,352 --> 01:32:30,768
Then grope for him in the gutter

1195
01:32:30,935 --> 01:32:31,935
What is it, Raju?

1196
01:32:33,226 --> 01:32:35,685
We've got the wrong urn.
It's empty!

1197
01:32:36,601 --> 01:32:37,601
Empty?

1198
01:32:38,893 --> 01:32:42,310
Empty - we'll empty it out!

1199
01:32:42,476 --> 01:32:43,435
No, no!

1200
01:32:43,436 --> 01:32:46,392
We'll empty it out

1201
01:32:46,393 --> 01:32:48,810
No... hands up!

1202
01:32:51,143 --> 01:32:54,143
Who are you?

1203
01:32:54,351 --> 01:32:55,435
I am Rancho

1204
01:32:56,768 --> 01:32:59,185
I swear on Papa, it's true

1205
01:32:59,435 --> 01:33:01,185
I am Rancho! That was Chhote.

1206
01:33:02,351 --> 01:33:03,351
Chhote?

1207
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:09,518
He was our gardener's son, Chhote

1208
01:33:11,518 --> 01:33:14,310
He stayed on with us
after he was orphaned

1209
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:24,351
Did odd jobs around the house,
ran errands

1210
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:27,060
He had a passion for learning

1211
01:33:30,351 --> 01:33:32,976
<i>He'd wear my old uniform
and slip into school</i>

1212
01:33:35,018 --> 01:33:37,935
<i>And attend any class he liked.
It suited me</i>

1213
01:33:38,935 --> 01:33:44,976
<i>I made him do my homework,
take my exams</i>

1214
01:33:45,518 --> 01:33:48,518
<i>It was going well, till
one day...</i>

1215
01:33:48,976 --> 01:33:53,600
<i>Our teacher saw a sixth grader
doing tenth grade math</i>

1216
01:33:53,601 --> 01:33:55,101
Which grade are you in, son?

1217
01:33:56,351 --> 01:33:57,518
What's your name?

1218
01:33:58,518 --> 01:33:59,518
<i>We got caught</i>

1219
01:34:00,643 --> 01:34:01,976
<i>Papa was a powerful man, so...</i>

1220
01:34:02,143 --> 01:34:05,601
<i>our teacher alerted him
before going to the Principal</i>

1221
01:34:06,143 --> 01:34:10,060
You started it, you will finish it

1222
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:15,560
People pretend to show me respect

1223
01:34:16,310 --> 01:34:18,476
But behind my back...

1224
01:34:19,476 --> 01:34:21,060
mock me as an illiterate

1225
01:34:22,101 --> 01:34:24,101
I won't let that happen to my son

1226
01:34:25,226 --> 01:34:29,518
This boy wants to study.
I want just a degree

1227
01:34:30,101 --> 01:34:32,018
Let the game go on

1228
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:34,643
Make this kid an engineer

1229
01:34:35,935 --> 01:34:41,268
and I'll have a degree
in my son's name on that wall

1230
01:34:41,643 --> 01:34:45,601
I went to London for four years,
he went to college as me

1231
01:34:47,310 --> 01:34:53,435
He'd promised to cut contact with all
after getting the degree

1232
01:34:55,601 --> 01:35:03,601
But he always said,
'Two idiots will come looking for me'

1233
01:35:08,810 --> 01:35:10,435
He really misses you both

1234
01:35:12,893 --> 01:35:16,810
I'll give you his address,
go to him

1235
01:35:20,185 --> 01:35:23,643
But please keep my secret

1236
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,685
What secret?

1237
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:43,518
You got the wrong urn, sir.
Papa is in here

1238
01:35:45,768 --> 01:35:48,392
What the hell's going on?
Who was that gun guy?

1239
01:35:48,393 --> 01:35:51,975
Complicated story.
Without subtitles. Not for you

1240
01:35:51,976 --> 01:35:54,226
Ignore it - Where're we going?

1241
01:35:55,601 --> 01:35:56,560
Ladakh

1242
01:35:56,561 --> 01:35:57,893
Ladakh! Why?

1243
01:35:58,643 --> 01:35:59,643
To meet Rancho

1244
01:35:59,768 --> 01:36:02,809
What's he doing in Ladakh?

1245
01:36:02,810 --> 01:36:06,351
No clue. We have
the address of a school

1246
01:36:06,643 --> 01:36:09,685
School teacher!

1247
01:36:10,601 --> 01:36:13,976
I'm Vice President of
Rockledge Corporation, and he...

1248
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:16,685
A for Apple, B for Ball...

1249
01:36:16,893 --> 01:36:18,060
D for Donkey

1250
01:36:18,810 --> 01:36:23,726
Next week I sign a huge deal
with Phunsukh Wangdu

1251
01:36:23,935 --> 01:36:26,935
And he... A for Apple, B for Ball...

1252
01:36:30,685 --> 01:36:33,060
<i>Today my respect
for that idiot shot up</i>

1253
01:36:34,018 --> 01:36:36,310
<i>Most of us went to college
just for a degree</i>

1254
01:36:36,935 --> 01:36:41,101
<i>No degree meant
no plum job, no pretty wife...</i>

1255
01:36:41,435 --> 01:36:43,976
<i>no credit card, no social status</i>

1256
01:36:44,685 --> 01:36:46,476
<i>None of this mattered to him</i>

1257
01:36:46,643 --> 01:36:48,435
<i>He was in college
for the joy of learning</i>

1258
01:36:48,976 --> 01:36:52,226
<i>He never cared
if he was first or last</i>

1259
01:36:52,851 --> 01:36:55,143
Who was the first man
on the Moon?

1260
01:36:55,435 --> 01:36:56,725
Neil Armstrong, sir

1261
01:36:56,726 --> 01:36:58,851
Obviously, it is Neil Armstrong.
We all know it

1262
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:00,268
Who was the second?

1263
01:37:00,810 --> 01:37:02,410
Don't waste your time.
It's not important

1264
01:37:02,893 --> 01:37:05,351
Nobody remembers the man
who ever came second

1265
01:37:06,518 --> 01:37:11,935
Soon, 26 companies
will be here with job offers

1266
01:37:12,435 --> 01:37:18,060
You'll have a job
even before your final exam

1267
01:37:18,851 --> 01:37:20,685
This is your last lap, my friends

1268
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:23,350
Put the pedal to the metal.
Step on the gas

1269
01:37:23,351 --> 01:37:25,310
Go out there and make history!

1270
01:37:28,768 --> 01:37:29,976
Any questions?

1271
01:37:32,518 --> 01:37:33,518
Yes?

1272
01:37:34,768 --> 01:37:38,351
Sir, suppose a student gets a job...

1273
01:37:38,768 --> 01:37:46,018
but narrowly fails the final exam,
will he still have the job?

1274
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:47,851
Very good question

1275
01:37:51,143 --> 01:37:53,476
Anyone else
with the same question?

1276
01:37:55,435 --> 01:37:56,726
As expected

1277
01:37:59,101 --> 01:38:02,185
Please come on stage.
Give them a big hand

1278
01:38:13,393 --> 01:38:15,725
For the last four years

1279
01:38:15,726 --> 01:38:18,643
they've been our most
consistent students

1280
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:22,101
Consistently last in every exam

1281
01:38:22,976 --> 01:38:24,310
Come my geniuses, come

1282
01:38:25,810 --> 01:38:31,393
Their brains will fetch
a handsome price

1283
01:38:32,143 --> 01:38:35,143
'Cause they're completely unused

1284
01:38:37,685 --> 01:38:38,893
And to answer their question -

1285
01:38:39,310 --> 01:38:42,601
The exam won't affect their jobs

1286
01:38:43,435 --> 01:38:46,935
Because no company
will hire them anyway!

1287
01:38:47,810 --> 01:38:50,810
They're so unique, their
names will be writ in gold -

1288
01:38:51,143 --> 01:38:54,142
'Farhanitrate' and 'Prerajulization'

1289
01:38:54,143 --> 01:38:55,663
Give them a big hand,
please, everybody

1290
01:39:04,726 --> 01:39:09,560
He screwed us!

1291
01:39:09,726 --> 01:39:11,643
In front of everyone

1292
01:39:12,810 --> 01:39:18,017
God, I'll give up meat,
light a 1000 incense sticks

1293
01:39:18,018 --> 01:39:19,892
Do me just one favor -

1294
01:39:19,893 --> 01:39:22,310
Delete Virus!

1295
01:39:23,976 --> 01:39:25,935
Burn him in hell

1296
01:39:27,351 --> 01:39:31,143
Fry Virus-nuggets in bubbling oil

1297
01:39:31,935 --> 01:39:34,768
You think God is a contract killer?

1298
01:39:35,435 --> 01:39:36,685
You shut up

1299
01:39:37,435 --> 01:39:40,392
You're in the center
of the photo every year

1300
01:39:40,393 --> 01:39:42,310
We're rotting in the corner

1301
01:39:43,393 --> 01:39:46,393
This year we may fall
out of the photo altogether

1302
01:39:48,893 --> 01:39:50,685
- Know why I come first?
- Why?

1303
01:39:51,143 --> 01:39:52,810
Because I love machines

1304
01:39:53,643 --> 01:39:55,435
Engineering is my passion

1305
01:39:56,518 --> 01:39:57,726
Know your passion?

1306
01:40:00,601 --> 01:40:02,268
That's my bag - Be quiet

1307
01:40:03,268 --> 01:40:04,560
What're you up to?

1308
01:40:07,018 --> 01:40:09,143
This... is your passion

1309
01:40:10,435 --> 01:40:11,810
Go post this letter

1310
01:40:12,226 --> 01:40:13,518
What letter?

1311
01:40:16,268 --> 01:40:20,518
5 years ago he wrote this for
his favorite wildlife photographer

1312
01:40:21,310 --> 01:40:24,060
Andre... - Istvan

1313
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:28,643
He wanted to train with him
in Hungary

1314
01:40:29,601 --> 01:40:32,893
But in fear of his dad, the Fuhrer,
never posted it

1315
01:40:34,643 --> 01:40:38,185
Quit Engineering, marry Photography

1316
01:40:39,185 --> 01:40:41,143
Follow your talent

1317
01:40:44,310 --> 01:40:48,310
If Michael Jackson's dad
forced him to be a boxer...

1318
01:40:49,143 --> 01:40:52,643
and Mohammad Ali's dad
pushed him to be a singer...

1319
01:40:53,393 --> 01:40:54,685
imagine the disaster

1320
01:40:56,768 --> 01:40:59,268
Do you get it?

1321
01:41:02,851 --> 01:41:06,143
Idiot! Loves Photography,
but is marrying machines

1322
01:41:10,810 --> 01:41:12,185
Your Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas

1323
01:41:13,518 --> 01:41:17,643
Engineering is
my wife and mistress both

1324
01:41:19,101 --> 01:41:21,601
- But I still fail. Why?
- Explain

1325
01:41:22,768 --> 01:41:25,101
'Cause you're a coward,
scared of the future

1326
01:41:26,851 --> 01:41:31,310
Look at this -
more holy rings than fingers

1327
01:41:31,893 --> 01:41:35,060
One ring per fear -
exam, sis's dowry, job

1328
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:40,310
With such fear of tomorrow,
how'll you live today?

1329
01:41:41,185 --> 01:41:42,810
How'll you focus on studies?

1330
01:41:44,185 --> 01:41:47,268
Strange buddies! One lives
in fear, the other in pretense

1331
01:41:48,268 --> 01:41:53,601
You live in both - fear and pretense

1332
01:41:53,851 --> 01:41:59,893
You're scared to tell Pia you
love her... so you pretend you don't

1333
01:42:02,435 --> 01:42:04,476
What rubbish!

1334
01:42:05,143 --> 01:42:09,309
Easy to offer free advice,
tough to follow it

1335
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:12,518
Have the guts? Go confess to Pia.

1336
01:42:13,018 --> 01:42:16,975
There's no connection!
Deep connection, Your Holiness

1337
01:42:16,976 --> 01:42:22,435
Listen, if you confess to Pia

1338
01:42:22,893 --> 01:42:27,310
I'll tell Dad - No Engineering,
I'm marrying Photography

1339
01:42:28,518 --> 01:42:32,143
And I'll dump my rings
before the job interview

1340
01:42:32,601 --> 01:42:33,643
Deal?

1341
01:42:35,768 --> 01:42:37,518
Have the guts?

1342
01:42:37,685 --> 01:42:39,935
His Holiness is speechless

1343
01:42:46,018 --> 01:42:47,018
Let's go

1344
01:42:51,935 --> 01:42:53,226
Follow me - Where?

1345
01:42:58,893 --> 01:43:00,393
Let's go

1346
01:43:00,851 --> 01:43:04,059
Hey Virus! I'm anti-Virus

1347
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:05,518
Hope no dog here

1348
01:43:05,685 --> 01:43:08,060
Cowards! Let's go

1349
01:43:08,226 --> 01:43:11,893
If any danger,
I'll give the Virus alert

1350
01:43:24,185 --> 01:43:25,726
Beware - Virus inside

1351
01:43:46,351 --> 01:43:47,518
Need background score?

1352
01:43:47,768 --> 01:43:48,768
Pia - Who's it?

1353
01:43:51,518 --> 01:43:55,185
Don't yell! It's me, Rancho

1354
01:43:57,143 --> 01:44:00,518
Just listen for a moment,
then I'm gone

1355
01:44:00,851 --> 01:44:03,226
<i>♪ Say not a word...</i>

1356
01:44:03,601 --> 01:44:04,601
Pia... - Yes?

1357
01:44:06,726 --> 01:44:10,018
Those 22 minutes with you
on the scooter

1358
01:44:10,893 --> 01:44:15,435
were the most enchanting
22 minutes of my life

1359
01:44:19,893 --> 01:44:25,268
I could spend an eternity
with you on the scooter

1360
01:44:25,435 --> 01:44:26,435
Wow

1361
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:30,643
<i>♪ ...and time stands still</i>

1362
01:44:31,726 --> 01:44:39,143
Every night you ride into my dreams
on your scooter, dressed as a bride

1363
01:44:42,143 --> 01:44:44,435
Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet

1364
01:44:47,935 --> 01:44:50,851
and come close to kiss me

1365
01:44:53,976 --> 01:44:56,226
But that kiss doesn't happen

1366
01:44:57,101 --> 01:44:58,101
Why?

1367
01:44:58,351 --> 01:45:01,476
Because the noses collide,
and I wake up

1368
01:45:02,601 --> 01:45:04,226
The noses never collide, stupid!

1369
01:45:09,393 --> 01:45:12,435
I'm sorry,
I thought you were Pia

1370
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:14,060
I wish I was

1371
01:45:14,310 --> 01:45:16,060
Sis, why did you interrupt?

1372
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,351
It took him four years
to say this

1373
01:45:18,601 --> 01:45:21,725
Pia, kiss him.
Show that noses don't collide

1374
01:45:21,726 --> 01:45:24,935
You have my permission,
kiss him... He's so cute!

1375
01:45:25,518 --> 01:45:27,143
- Who's this?
- My sister

1376
01:45:28,185 --> 01:45:29,185
Who're you?

1377
01:45:38,893 --> 01:45:42,684
When you were talking,
he kicked. First time!

1378
01:45:42,685 --> 01:45:46,476
He? How do you know
it's a 'he' or 'she'?

1379
01:45:46,810 --> 01:45:50,810
Papa asked the astrologer If we'd
get an engineer or a doctor

1380
01:45:51,810 --> 01:45:52,810
Meaning?

1381
01:45:52,893 --> 01:45:55,726
Boy becomes an engineer,
girl a doctor

1382
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:02,018
Champ, better stay inside.
Out here's a circus

1383
01:46:03,143 --> 01:46:06,851
Your grandpa is the ringmaster.
He'll crack his whip -

1384
01:46:07,018 --> 01:46:12,393
'Run! Life is a race.
Be an engineer'

1385
01:46:13,268 --> 01:46:18,476
But you follow your heart.
If grandpa scares you...

1386
01:46:19,310 --> 01:46:22,643
put your hand on your heart
and say, 'All is well'

1387
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:24,560
He kicked

1388
01:46:26,351 --> 01:46:27,393
Say it again

1389
01:46:28,643 --> 01:46:30,226
All is well

1390
01:46:31,143 --> 01:46:32,810
Kicked again

1391
01:46:34,476 --> 01:46:37,435
Once more - All is well

1392
01:46:41,976 --> 01:46:46,101
All is well

1393
01:46:46,685 --> 01:46:47,685
Who is it?

1394
01:46:48,518 --> 01:46:49,518
Go

1395
01:46:50,185 --> 01:46:55,309
You sent hate-mail to Dad,
here's pee-mail for you

1396
01:46:55,310 --> 01:46:59,726
Enjoy the pee-mail, happy reading!

1397
01:47:06,226 --> 01:47:08,935
Who is it? Your future son-in-law

1398
01:47:09,226 --> 01:47:10,685
And the wedding party

1399
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:12,601
Rastogi!

1400
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:16,851
Security, that way

1401
01:47:46,476 --> 01:47:50,185
So you all have already learned
about the simple pendulum

1402
01:47:50,935 --> 01:47:54,810
Now let's get down to the advanced
study about compound pendulum

1403
01:47:56,268 --> 01:48:00,226
It's an irregular object
oscillating about its own axis

1404
01:48:00,685 --> 01:48:01,726
Let me demonstrate to you

1405
01:48:02,351 --> 01:48:04,268
- What's this?
- Pencil

1406
01:48:04,601 --> 01:48:06,100
- What's inside?
- Lead

1407
01:48:06,101 --> 01:48:08,226
Good. Lead is the axis to this pencil

1408
01:48:08,768 --> 01:48:11,726
Even you can be a compound
pendulum, if you oscillate about...

1409
01:48:19,393 --> 01:48:21,976
Where is Raju Rastogi?
Present, sir

1410
01:48:29,476 --> 01:48:31,351
Hi. Everybody is here

1411
01:48:33,060 --> 01:48:34,101
Good morning, sir

1412
01:48:35,060 --> 01:48:36,226
Where were you last night?

1413
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:39,851
Studying all night, sir
Studying?

1414
01:48:40,060 --> 01:48:41,060
Really?

1415
01:48:41,143 --> 01:48:44,225
Hasn't slept two nights,
that's why he looks scruffy

1416
01:48:44,226 --> 01:48:45,226
Not slept?

1417
01:48:45,310 --> 01:48:46,310
What did you study?

1418
01:48:47,435 --> 01:48:51,435
Induction motor, sir.
The whole chapter

1419
01:48:51,768 --> 01:48:52,768
Whole chapter?

1420
01:48:52,893 --> 01:48:55,017
In that case, Mr. Raju Rastogi...

1421
01:48:55,018 --> 01:48:56,018
Yes sir!

1422
01:48:56,060 --> 01:48:58,685
Can you tell us how an
induction motor starts?

1423
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:07,810
Stop it

1424
01:49:15,393 --> 01:49:17,643
Sir, rum

1425
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:20,560
Mr. Rastogi

1426
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:23,393
Let's have a cup of tea
in my office

1427
01:49:29,518 --> 01:49:30,518
Sir?

1428
01:49:31,643 --> 01:49:32,643
Close the door

1429
01:49:37,810 --> 01:49:38,851
Can you type?

1430
01:49:40,185 --> 01:49:41,185
Yes, sir

1431
01:49:41,268 --> 01:49:42,685
Will you type a letter for me?

1432
01:49:44,810 --> 01:49:45,851
Definitely, sir

1433
01:49:46,185 --> 01:49:47,185
Come, sit

1434
01:49:47,893 --> 01:49:48,893
Sir, I'm sorry sir...

1435
01:49:51,310 --> 01:49:52,310
Please type

1436
01:49:53,935 --> 01:49:54,935
Dear Sir...

1437
01:49:55,726 --> 01:49:59,101
It is my painful duty to inform you...

1438
01:50:00,435 --> 01:50:03,101
that your son is rusticated...

1439
01:50:03,893 --> 01:50:06,435
No, sorry, delete that. Go back

1440
01:50:07,185 --> 01:50:11,226
Your son, Mr. Raju Rastogi...

1441
01:50:12,351 --> 01:50:16,476
is rusticated from the
Imperial College of Engineering

1442
01:50:17,101 --> 01:50:18,476
Come on, type

1443
01:50:25,976 --> 01:50:27,643
It'll kill my dad, sir

1444
01:50:27,851 --> 01:50:29,601
Please type - Sir, please sir

1445
01:50:30,101 --> 01:50:34,018
My decision is final and
irrevocable

1446
01:50:36,101 --> 01:50:41,309
He lives just to see me
become an engineer

1447
01:50:41,310 --> 01:50:45,560
Should've thought of that
before peeing on my door

1448
01:50:45,726 --> 01:50:50,143
Sir, give me one chance... please

1449
01:50:55,768 --> 01:50:59,143
OK, remove your name
from the letter...

1450
01:51:00,518 --> 01:51:02,643
and put in Rancho's

1451
01:51:04,101 --> 01:51:06,268
I know he was with you
last night

1452
01:51:07,143 --> 01:51:11,185
Be my witness and I'll spare you

1453
01:51:14,768 --> 01:51:18,768

01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:04,268
Rancho, watch that monitor

1465
01:53:04,601 --> 01:53:05,601
Raju

1466
01:53:07,185 --> 01:53:10,310
His body is paralyzed with shock,
but his mind is alert

1467
01:53:10,851 --> 01:53:15,143
He can see and hear us.
Please don't cry in front of him

1468
01:53:17,018 --> 01:53:21,393
Speak to him normally,
motivate him, joke around

1469
01:53:24,435 --> 01:53:27,060
Good news, Raju.
Your dad's recovered

1470
01:53:27,310 --> 01:53:28,643
The new medicine worked

1471
01:53:29,101 --> 01:53:31,893
Is this your family tradition -

1472
01:53:32,726 --> 01:53:35,810
As one male gets up,
the other conks out?

1473
01:53:36,018 --> 01:53:37,726
Come, wake up

1474
01:53:38,643 --> 01:53:40,018
Your dad wants Pia's scooter

1475
01:53:40,185 --> 01:53:43,976
Should I give it to him?
Hope he won't dent it

1476
01:53:50,018 --> 01:53:54,310
Raju, Farhan is live on webcam.
From the hostel

1477
01:53:56,601 --> 01:53:59,393
Look, Virus has canceled
your suspension order

1478
01:53:59,768 --> 01:54:01,976
Problem solved... Wake up now

1479
01:54:02,310 --> 01:54:05,018
Everything's resolved!
You hear that?

1480
01:54:05,435 --> 01:54:08,226

01:55:05,810 --> 01:55:09,643
Look, mom bought a new saree
Brand new

1492
01:55:09,810 --> 01:55:11,393
It cost 2000Rs.

1493
01:55:12,101 --> 01:55:13,310
Wake up now

1494
01:55:14,518 --> 01:55:16,601
She bought not one,
but ten sarees

1495
01:55:17,101 --> 01:55:18,101
Look!

1496
01:55:20,101 --> 01:55:21,267
Hey Raju!

1497
01:55:21,268 --> 01:55:24,268

1504
01:55:58,351 --> 01:56:01,768
Did you hear about your sis?

1505
01:56:02,726 --> 01:56:05,393
She's getting married

1506
01:56:06,435 --> 01:56:07,726
Without any dowry

1507
01:56:08,435 --> 01:56:13,310
The bridegroom wants
nothing at all

1508
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:17,018
He just wants Kammo

1509
01:56:17,685 --> 01:56:21,892
You know who the bridegroom is?
Yeah

1510
01:56:21,893 --> 01:56:22,810
Guess!

1511
01:56:22,811 --> 01:56:24,685
You know him very well - Yes

1512
01:56:24,893 --> 01:56:26,518
He loves animals - Huh...?

1513
01:56:27,351 --> 01:56:29,475
He's going to be a
wildlife photographer

1514
01:56:29,476 --> 01:56:31,142
Quiet... Shhhh...

1515
01:56:31,143 --> 01:56:34,268
Didn't get it? It's our Farhan

1516
01:56:35,268 --> 01:56:39,351
Farhan will never take any dowry

1517
01:56:40,018 --> 01:56:44,351
Farhan will marry your sister

1518
01:56:44,810 --> 01:56:48,935
For free! Free! Free!

1519
01:56:50,018 --> 01:56:52,101
Raju!

1520
01:56:59,101 --> 01:57:02,851
One kilo okra, 500 grams cheese
for 'free' would've woken him

1521
01:57:03,268 --> 01:57:04,976
Why sacrifice me...!

1522
01:57:05,268 --> 01:57:07,226
Well done, buddy

1523
01:57:08,060 --> 01:57:11,560
So it's all fixed -
Farhan will marry your sister

1524

Rancho

1525
01:57:16,310 --> 01:57:19,435

You called for a taxi?

1534
01:58:08,518 --> 01:58:10,268
I did - It's waiting

1535
01:58:10,435 --> 01:58:11,893
Thank you. Why?

1536
01:58:12,351 --> 01:58:13,643
I'm going to the job interview

1537
01:58:13,935 --> 01:58:15,143
You coming with me?

1538
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:20,143
No. I'm going for the interview.
You're going home

1539
01:58:20,310 --> 01:58:21,643
Why would I go home?

1540
01:58:23,185 --> 01:58:26,601
Remember, we promised
this rascal

1541
01:58:29,976 --> 01:58:32,018
Give me your tie

1542
01:58:33,601 --> 01:58:34,601
Why?

1543
01:58:34,685 --> 01:58:38,560
I doubt you'll go for the
interview after reading this

1544
01:58:39,518 --> 01:58:40,518
What's that?

1545
01:58:40,601 --> 01:58:43,435
A letter - For you, from Hungary

1546
01:58:43,810 --> 01:58:46,393
Some photographer
called Andre Istvan

1547
01:58:54,351 --> 01:58:56,101
You posted my letter!

1548
01:58:56,310 --> 01:58:57,976
He loved your pictures

1549
01:58:58,476 --> 01:59:01,101
The guy wants you to assist him...

1550
01:59:01,935 --> 01:59:05,435
in the Brazilian rain forest,
for a year

1551
01:59:05,851 --> 01:59:07,393
Will pay you, too

1552
01:59:23,351 --> 01:59:24,601
Dad will never agree

1553
01:59:27,226 --> 01:59:29,851
Go speak to him...
from your heart

1554
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:32,685
For once, dump your fears...

1555
01:59:33,393 --> 01:59:39,393
or someday, on your deathbed,
you'll regret it

1556
01:59:39,935 --> 01:59:42,615
You'll remember that the letter was
in your hand, taxi at the gate...

1557
01:59:42,643 --> 01:59:46,393
With just a little courage, you
could've turned your life around

1558
01:59:52,976 --> 01:59:54,893
Do you think he'll like it?

1559
01:59:55,560 --> 01:59:57,851
Why such an expensive gift?

1560
01:59:59,018 --> 02:00:01,435
Our son's getting
his first job today

1561
02:00:02,768 --> 02:00:06,643
Don't be stingy at
such a proud moment

1562
02:00:08,601 --> 02:00:09,601
Farhan?

1563
02:00:14,685 --> 02:00:16,935
Don't you have
the job interview today?

1564
02:00:18,768 --> 02:00:19,768
I didn't go

1565
02:00:22,393 --> 02:00:24,101
I don't want to be
an engineer, Dad

1566
02:00:28,351 --> 02:00:30,268
What happened?
You had an accident?

1567
02:00:33,935 --> 02:00:39,143
See that building?
I jumped from its third floor

1568
02:00:41,976 --> 02:00:42,976
Why?

1569
02:00:43,226 --> 02:00:45,518
Because I was rusticated
from college

1570
02:00:48,476 --> 02:00:49,476
Why?

1571
02:00:49,810 --> 02:00:54,601
Drunk, I urinated
on the Director's door

1572
02:00:56,935 --> 02:01:00,560
That scoundrel Rancho
is messing with your mind!

1573
02:01:00,726 --> 02:01:04,435
I don't enjoy Engineering.
I'd make a terrible engineer

1574
02:01:06,601 --> 02:01:11,185
Rancho has a simple belief -
Make your passion your profession

1575
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:13,101
Then work will become play

1576
02:01:13,268 --> 02:01:15,143
What'll you earn in that jungle?

1577
02:01:15,810 --> 02:01:19,517
A small stipend, but I'll learn a lot

1578
02:01:19,518 --> 02:01:20,685
Five years from now...

1579
02:01:21,435 --> 02:01:26,267
when you see your friends buying
cars and homes, you'll curse yourself

1580
02:01:26,268 --> 02:01:30,226
Life as an engineer will bring
only frustration. Then I'll curse you

1581
02:01:32,310 --> 02:01:34,060
I'd rather curse myself, Dad

1582
02:01:34,226 --> 02:01:35,393
The world will laugh!

1583
02:01:36,685 --> 02:01:38,643
Label you a loser,
for quitting in the final year

1584
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:45,226
Mr. Kapoor feels you're fortunate
to be at ICE. What'll he think?

1585
02:01:45,518 --> 02:01:47,643
Mr. Kapoor didn't provide me
with an air-conditioner

1586
02:01:50,476 --> 02:01:52,956
It wasn't Mr. Kapoor who slept
in discomfort while I slept well

1587
02:01:55,101 --> 02:01:58,060
He didn't take me around the zoo
on his shoulders

1588
02:02:00,935 --> 02:02:02,143
You did all that, Dad

1589
02:02:04,643 --> 02:02:10,060
How you feel, matters to me.
Mr. Kapoor makes no difference

1590
02:02:11,268 --> 02:02:13,101
I don't even know his first name

1591
02:02:13,268 --> 02:02:16,143
You think you're the hero
of a melodrama?

1592
02:02:16,351 --> 02:02:19,060
Enough, please... he's upset

1593
02:02:20,351 --> 02:02:22,768
God forbid, if he did
something crazy like Raju...

1594
02:02:23,018 --> 02:02:24,560
Then the discussion is over

1595
02:02:24,893 --> 02:02:28,643
Don't say a word or
His Lordship will jump off the roof

1596
02:02:32,143 --> 02:02:37,101
No, Dad. I'll never attempt suicide.
I promise

1597
02:02:39,643 --> 02:02:46,601
The Rancho you detest
put this picture in my wallet

1598
02:02:48,226 --> 02:02:52,018
Told me to see it if a suicidal thought
crossed my mind

1599
02:02:52,185 --> 02:02:55,517
and imagine what'd happen
to your smiles

1600
02:02:55,518 --> 02:02:57,268
when you see my dead body

1601
02:03:02,601 --> 02:03:06,601
I want to convince you, Dad

1602
02:03:08,101 --> 02:03:10,518
but not with a suicide threat

1603
02:03:14,310 --> 02:03:18,101
Dad, what'll happen
if I become a photographer?

1604
02:03:18,435 --> 02:03:19,643
I'll earn less

1605
02:03:20,601 --> 02:03:22,268
I'll have a smaller house,
a smaller car

1606
02:03:24,351 --> 02:03:25,851
But I'll be happy

1607
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:28,810
I will be really happy

1608
02:03:30,143 --> 02:03:32,063
Whatever I do for you
will be out of genuine love

1609
02:03:33,726 --> 02:03:35,435
I've always listened to you

1610
02:03:35,851 --> 02:03:38,935
For once,
let me listen to my heart

1611
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:42,060
Please... Dad

1612
02:03:48,393 --> 02:03:49,393
Dad...

1613
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:51,768
Please don't go away...

1614
02:03:58,018 --> 02:03:59,185
Return this

1615
02:04:02,726 --> 02:04:05,143
Son, what's the cost
of a professional camera?

1616
02:04:06,435 --> 02:04:08,185
Can the laptop be exchanged for it?

1617
02:04:09,685 --> 02:04:11,518
If you need more money, just ask

1618
02:04:20,351 --> 02:04:22,268
Go live your life, my son

1619
02:04:25,226 --> 02:04:29,476
Your grades are consistently poor.
Reason?

1620
02:04:30,185 --> 02:04:31,185
Fear

1621
02:04:32,143 --> 02:04:33,543
I was a good student
since childhood

1622
02:04:34,310 --> 02:04:36,435
Parents hoped
I'd end their poverty

1623
02:04:38,393 --> 02:04:39,393
That scared me

1624
02:04:40,893 --> 02:04:44,351
Here I saw the mad race.
You don't count if you're not first

1625
02:04:46,101 --> 02:04:47,101
My fear grew

1626
02:04:48,810 --> 02:04:50,226
Fear is not good for grades, sir

1627
02:04:50,893 --> 02:04:53,268
I slipped on more
charms and rings

1628
02:04:54,310 --> 02:04:58,726
Prayed to God for favors.
No... begged for favors

1629
02:05:01,851 --> 02:05:04,935
16 broken bones gave me
two months to think and reflect

1630
02:05:05,518 --> 02:05:06,726
Finally, sense dawned

1631
02:05:08,268 --> 02:05:13,393
Today I didn't beg God for this job,
just thanked him for this life

1632
02:05:15,893 --> 02:05:19,851
If you reject me, no regrets

1633
02:05:20,226 --> 02:05:24,310
I'll still do something
worthwhile with my life

1634
02:05:24,893 --> 02:05:30,060
Such frank behavior
is not good for our firm

1635
02:05:30,685 --> 02:05:35,059
We need someone diplomatic
to handle clients

1636
02:05:35,060 --> 02:05:37,393
You're too straightforward

1637
02:05:39,310 --> 02:05:40,310
But...

1638
02:05:41,310 --> 02:05:47,726
if you assure us
you'll control this attitude

1639
02:05:47,893 --> 02:05:50,851
we may consider you

1640
02:05:54,226 --> 02:05:57,351
It took two broken legs
to get me up on my feet

1641
02:05:59,268 --> 02:06:01,060
Wasn't easy to get this attitude

1642
02:06:01,810 --> 02:06:02,810
Can't change it, sir

1643
02:06:06,351 --> 02:06:11,560
You keep your job...
I'll keep my attitude

1644
02:06:11,726 --> 02:06:13,060
I'm sorry, no offense, sir

1645
02:06:17,476 --> 02:06:18,476
Wait

1646
02:06:20,310 --> 02:06:24,268
I've interviewed countless
candidates for 25 years

1647
02:06:24,726 --> 02:06:27,560
Everyone turns into
a yes-man to get the job

1648
02:06:27,768 --> 02:06:29,101
Where did you spring from, son?

1649
02:06:31,060 --> 02:06:32,060
Sir?

1650
02:06:32,143 --> 02:06:34,726
Shall we discuss the salary?

1651
02:06:42,310 --> 02:06:43,310
Thank you, sir

1652
02:07:15,768 --> 02:07:19,935
Your Majesty, thou art great

1653
02:07:21,893 --> 02:07:23,518
Accept this humble offering

1654
02:08:00,143 --> 02:08:03,560
Govind!

1655
02:08:05,643 --> 02:08:09,101
You had said, 'If he gets a job,
shave it off'

1656
02:08:16,351 --> 02:08:17,351
What have you done?

1657
02:08:20,976 --> 02:08:24,351
I feel naked without
my moustache

1658
02:08:26,685 --> 02:08:28,560
I've lost my dignity

1659
02:08:30,685 --> 02:08:33,101
I won't accept defeat, Rastogi

1660
02:08:34,435 --> 02:08:38,435
The job isn't yours until you
pass your final exam

1661
02:08:39,935 --> 02:08:43,851
And this time,
I will set the question paper

1662
02:08:47,101 --> 02:08:49,643
Dad, that's not fair

1663
02:08:52,018 --> 02:08:55,518
Everything is fair in
Love and War

1664
02:08:56,060 --> 02:08:59,351
And this is World War... III

1665
02:09:00,851 --> 02:09:01,891
Rastogi, you're dead meat!

1666
02:09:06,851 --> 02:09:07,851
Hey

1667
02:09:10,185 --> 02:09:11,185
What're you doing here?

1668
02:09:14,060 --> 02:09:15,060
Be careful

1669
02:09:20,601 --> 02:09:24,435
You've been drinking
Yup, had to down a couple

1670
02:09:25,018 --> 02:09:27,309
A couple too many!

1671
02:09:27,310 --> 02:09:29,185
Needed the guts - For what?

1672
02:09:30,976 --> 02:09:32,476
For stealing this - What's this?

1673
02:09:33,601 --> 02:09:37,726
The duplicate key to
Virus's office

1674
02:09:40,268 --> 02:09:42,560
The question paper's
in a cover with a red seal

1675
02:09:43,268 --> 02:09:47,226
Dad has set it, to fail Raju

1676
02:09:47,560 --> 02:09:48,560
Go get it!

1677
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:52,101
Are you mad or what -
that's cheating!

1678
02:09:56,601 --> 02:09:59,810
Everything's fair in
Love and War

1679
02:10:01,351 --> 02:10:02,351
Tell me something...

1680
02:10:04,310 --> 02:10:05,476
Do you really feel...

1681
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:12,560
the noses collide while kissing?

1682
02:10:18,018 --> 02:10:21,726
Wait. Have some dhokla

1683
02:10:24,226 --> 02:10:26,810
You Gujaratis are so cute

1684
02:10:27,768 --> 02:10:31,060
But why does your food
sound so dangerous?

1685
02:10:32,185 --> 02:10:37,393
Dhokla, Fafda, Handwa,
Thepla, Khakhra

1686
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:40,725
Sound like missiles

1687
02:10:40,726 --> 02:10:41,726
C'mon

1688
02:10:41,810 --> 02:10:44,268
'Today Bush dropped
two Dhoklas on Iraq'

1689
02:10:44,935 --> 02:10:47,768
'400 dead, 200 injured'

1690
02:10:48,143 --> 02:10:49,143
C'mon

1691
02:10:52,518 --> 02:10:53,518
Oh...

1692
02:10:55,018 --> 02:10:59,435
I can deal with Khakhra, Fafda.
But your name...

1693
02:11:00,393 --> 02:11:03,685
'Ranchhoddas Shamaldas
Chanchad' - Yuck

1694
02:11:04,935 --> 02:11:07,476
I won't change my last name
after marriage

1695
02:11:09,351 --> 02:11:12,310
Pia, we can't get married

1696
02:11:15,893 --> 02:11:16,893
Why?

1697
02:11:17,643 --> 02:11:19,060
Is there someone else?

1698
02:11:21,601 --> 02:11:22,601
No

1699
02:11:22,768 --> 02:11:24,476
- Are you gay?
- No

1700
02:11:26,351 --> 02:11:28,226
Then why don't you
propose to me?

1701
02:11:32,810 --> 02:11:34,226
- Are you impotent?
- No

1702
02:11:36,935 --> 02:11:38,726
Then prove it

1703
02:11:39,226 --> 02:11:40,226
Pia, no

1704
02:11:40,435 --> 02:11:41,851
Stop, stop!

1705
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:44,393
What happened?
We didn't inform Pia

1706
02:11:44,893 --> 02:11:47,017
Stop here,
my bladders are bursting

1707
02:11:47,018 --> 02:11:48,851
Shut up!
Are you in touch with her?

1708
02:11:49,185 --> 02:11:52,310
No... I have her home number
Then call her, I'll stop

1709
02:11:58,810 --> 02:11:59,726
Hello

1710
02:11:59,727 --> 02:12:02,017
No place for urine-expulsion
in this country

1711
02:12:02,018 --> 02:12:05,393
Hello, is Pia there?
No, she's not

1712
02:12:05,810 --> 02:12:07,560
Is she at the hospital?

1713
02:12:07,726 --> 02:12:09,268
Why would she be there?

1714
02:12:09,518 --> 02:12:11,685
She's getting married today
in Manali

1715
02:12:19,726 --> 02:12:20,935
Too late! She's married

1716
02:12:22,393 --> 02:12:25,268
Not yet. It's a six hour drive

1717
02:12:25,643 --> 02:12:27,685
If we rush, we'll reach
before the vows

1718
02:12:28,226 --> 02:12:29,226
What do you say?

1719
02:12:31,060 --> 02:12:33,435
It's a no-brainer. Let's turn back

1720
02:12:33,685 --> 02:12:35,393
No turning back

1721
02:12:35,893 --> 02:12:38,601
Straight to Ladakh.
We'll meet Rancho and return

1722
02:12:38,810 --> 02:12:41,351
I have a Friday meeting with
Phunsukh Wangdu

1723
02:12:41,518 --> 02:12:43,018
Get into the car

1724
02:12:43,310 --> 02:12:46,435
If I miss my meeting,
the Japanese will get him

1725
02:12:46,851 --> 02:12:49,226
They're offering him a
first name in the company

1726
02:12:49,393 --> 02:12:52,351
'Phunsukh and Fujiyashi',
profit sharing...

1727
02:13:25,601 --> 02:13:27,726
Pia weds Suhas!
Thanks for the suit

1728
02:13:30,101 --> 02:13:31,560
Virus will have a heart attack

1729
02:13:32,685 --> 02:13:35,351
At every daughter's wedding,
we're there to rock the party

1730
02:13:36,810 --> 02:13:40,185
Listen, I'll update Pia,
you peel off the price tag

1731
02:13:57,018 --> 02:13:59,226
Farhan - We found Rancho

1732
02:14:07,393 --> 02:14:08,976
- For Room 107?
- Yes, sir

1733
02:14:09,726 --> 02:14:12,518
- You've taken ages.
- Sorry, sir

1734
02:14:12,685 --> 02:14:13,685
Off, now

1735
02:14:22,601 --> 02:14:24,268
Housekeeping, sir - Come in

1736
02:14:24,851 --> 02:14:27,559
<i>♪ Amore... Amore... ♪</i>

1737
02:14:27,560 --> 02:14:29,017
Quick, iron my coat

1738
02:14:29,018 --> 02:14:31,851
<i>♪ Amore... Amore... ♪</i>

1739
02:14:32,726 --> 02:14:35,935
We found Rancho!
Now you can't marry this ass

1740
02:14:36,476 --> 02:14:37,518
You're mad, Farhan

1741
02:14:38,685 --> 02:14:41,310
Don't fool yourself, Pia.
You still love Rancho

1742
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:43,476
You're still eating his favorite food

1743
02:14:43,810 --> 02:14:46,435
<i>♪ Amore... Amore... ♪</i>

1744
02:15:01,851 --> 02:15:06,142
He's incorrigible.
Once a price tag, always a price tag

1745
02:15:06,143 --> 02:15:08,976
Shut up, Farhan.
Suhas is a changed man

1746
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:11,600
He doesn't speak of
brands and prices anymore

1747
02:15:11,601 --> 02:15:14,892
My 150,000/ - coat

1748
02:15:14,893 --> 02:15:17,059
Why do you people eat sauce?

1749
02:15:17,060 --> 02:15:19,642
I'll sort it out, sir - How?

1750
02:15:19,643 --> 02:15:22,185
Our laundry specializes in
cleaning mint-stained suits

1751
02:15:22,351 --> 02:15:24,310
I'll clean it in a jiffy

1752
02:15:29,643 --> 02:15:30,935
Get it soon

1753
02:15:31,935 --> 02:15:34,143
But it's too late now, Farhan
Pia

1754
02:15:35,060 --> 02:15:37,268
Let's go, Pia, we're late

1755
02:15:48,726 --> 02:15:52,060
Pia, it's me... Raju.
Don't yell, they'll kill me

1756
02:15:57,226 --> 02:15:58,185
Where is Suhas?

1757
02:15:58,186 --> 02:16:00,893
Housekeeping took my coat

1758
02:16:01,393 --> 02:16:03,143
Go... Send Suhas here

1759
02:16:03,393 --> 02:16:06,560
It's rude to leave the ceremony

1760
02:16:17,893 --> 02:16:19,518
- Yeah, Farhan?
- The car's ready

1761
02:16:19,893 --> 02:16:22,476
Grab her hand and run.
Don't move

1762
02:16:24,018 --> 02:16:25,684
Sir... - My coat?

1763
02:16:25,685 --> 02:16:26,810
You're here...

1764
02:16:27,018 --> 02:16:28,601
- So who's at the altar?
- Altar?

1765
02:16:30,935 --> 02:16:33,393
Another couple of rounds,
and we'll be considered married

1766
02:16:33,601 --> 02:16:35,851
I'm already married, Pia.
Let's go

1767
02:16:36,351 --> 02:16:39,601
It's too late.
People will laugh at me

1768
02:16:39,893 --> 02:16:41,643
So you'll commit suicide?

1769
02:16:42,268 --> 02:16:43,268
Rastogi!

1770
02:16:43,269 --> 02:16:45,351
People will gossip briefly,
then forget

1771
02:16:46,768 --> 02:16:49,850
But you... you'll regret
on your deathbed

1772
02:16:49,851 --> 02:16:52,601
that the car was at the gate,
Rancho within reach...

1773
02:16:52,976 --> 02:16:56,435
but in fear of people,
you married this ass

1774
02:16:58,643 --> 02:16:59,643
Housekeeping?

1775
02:17:39,310 --> 02:17:42,310
Pia, minor problem

1776
02:17:42,643 --> 02:17:43,643
What?

1777
02:17:43,935 --> 02:17:45,642
We don't know if Rancho's married

1778
02:17:45,643 --> 02:17:46,560
What!

1779
02:17:46,561 --> 02:17:49,185
He won't be married
And if he is?

1780
02:17:50,101 --> 02:17:51,476
Then we'll drop you back

1781
02:17:52,393 --> 02:17:56,143
Relax! Handmade biscuit?

1782
02:18:00,018 --> 02:18:01,018
What's he doing here?

1783
02:18:01,935 --> 02:18:05,310
Ignore him
The biscuit's very good

1784
02:18:06,393 --> 02:18:08,226
<i>Till yesterday,
I was a law-abiding citizen</i>

1785
02:18:08,768 --> 02:18:12,601
<i>But in the last 24 hours,
I'd grounded an aircraft</i>

1786
02:18:13,435 --> 02:18:15,851
<i>almost assigned Shamaldas's
ashes to the sewers, and</i>

1787
02:18:16,143 --> 02:18:20,518
<i>made a bride elope from her
own wedding! All for Rancho</i>

1788
02:18:22,018 --> 02:18:24,101
<i>But he too would do
anything for friends</i>

1789
02:18:24,393 --> 02:18:27,975
<i>Like stealing the question paper...
from the lion's den</i>

1790
02:18:27,976 --> 02:18:29,016
Envelope with the red seal

1791
02:18:30,018 --> 02:18:34,976
<i>He feared that if Raju failed,
there'd be another high jump</i>

1792
02:18:38,185 --> 02:18:43,435
<i>We were principled thieves,
stealing the paper only for Raju</i>

1793
02:18:43,851 --> 02:18:45,251
<i>We'd sworn we won't even
take a peek</i>

1794
02:18:47,685 --> 02:18:48,976
Where's it hidden...

1795
02:18:49,185 --> 02:18:52,768
We'll grow old searching!
Ask Pia

1796
02:18:59,018 --> 02:19:00,143
Pia, your phone

1797
02:19:01,435 --> 02:19:04,767
Mr. Papa-To-Be!
If you say 'All is well', he kicks

1798
02:19:04,768 --> 02:19:05,768
He kicked

1799
02:19:08,060 --> 02:19:09,518
Pia, your phone

1800
02:19:15,393 --> 02:19:16,601
Found it! Rancho

1801
02:19:18,101 --> 02:19:19,101
Hello?

1802
02:19:37,518 --> 02:19:39,726
Quick, photocopy this

1803
02:20:00,851 --> 02:20:01,851
Where was it?

1804
02:20:02,018 --> 02:20:03,018
Put it back

1805
02:20:26,351 --> 02:20:28,351
- We're safe!
- Where were you?

1806
02:20:32,976 --> 02:20:34,643
Here - What's this?

1807
02:20:35,018 --> 02:20:36,018
A gift

1808
02:20:37,060 --> 02:20:40,935
Question paper.
Virus set it himself, to fail you

1809
02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:49,851
Strange buddies!

1810
02:20:51,226 --> 02:20:55,768
First teach you to be upright,
then offer a path to shame

1811
02:20:57,851 --> 02:20:58,851
No way

1812
02:21:00,476 --> 02:21:01,836
If I pass,
it'll be on my own steam

1813
02:21:05,726 --> 02:21:06,851
If I don't, it's still OK

1814
02:21:24,101 --> 02:21:28,601
<i>He'd won us over!
I felt like embracing him as family...</i>

1815
02:21:29,560 --> 02:21:31,435
<i>but then I controlled my emotions</i>

1816
02:21:50,560 --> 02:21:53,518
Damn thief - Sir, please, sir

1817
02:21:53,685 --> 02:21:56,851
Rascal - Sorry sir

1818
02:21:57,435 --> 02:21:58,685
Wanted to change the system

1819
02:22:00,435 --> 02:22:05,351
You'll pee on my door
Sir, what're you doing

1820
02:22:06,893 --> 02:22:07,893
Sorry sir

1821
02:22:09,351 --> 02:22:11,185
You are rusticated!

1822
02:22:12,018 --> 02:22:14,976
If all of you aren't out by morning,
I'll call the police

1823
02:22:15,435 --> 02:22:16,726
I will call the police!

1824
02:22:19,268 --> 02:22:20,268
Rascals!

1825
02:22:20,435 --> 02:22:21,726
Rascals, all of you

1826
02:22:25,768 --> 02:22:28,060
How did he get my office key?

1827
02:22:29,393 --> 02:22:30,768
I gave him the key, Dad

1828
02:22:32,185 --> 02:22:35,768
I wish I'd given this key to
my brother... He'd be alive today

1829
02:22:35,976 --> 02:22:36,976
Stop it, Pia

1830
02:22:38,018 --> 02:22:40,810
You think your son
fell off a train and died?

1831
02:22:41,393 --> 02:22:42,393
Shut up, Pia

1832
02:22:42,394 --> 02:22:44,643
You decided he'd be an engineer

1833
02:22:44,851 --> 02:22:47,101
Did you ever ask him
what he wanted to be?

1834
02:22:47,935 --> 02:22:49,476
You put such pressure on him...

1835
02:22:49,893 --> 02:22:52,143
that he chose death
over the entrance exam

1836
02:22:56,435 --> 02:22:57,435
I don't understand...

1837
02:22:58,101 --> 02:23:00,643
Dad, you go to your room

1838
02:23:04,560 --> 02:23:06,893
Pia, don't do this

1839
02:23:09,393 --> 02:23:13,268
He wanted to study Literature,
be a writer

1840
02:23:15,560 --> 02:23:18,100
But all he wrote was
this suicide note

1841
02:23:18,101 --> 02:23:19,351
Put that away, please

1842
02:23:19,560 --> 02:23:21,185
No more cover-ups!

1843
02:23:24,601 --> 02:23:27,892
Just once...

1844
02:23:27,893 --> 02:23:31,560
if you'd said - Don't do Engineering
if you don't want to

1845
02:23:32,435 --> 02:23:33,810
just do what your heart is in

1846
02:23:35,310 --> 02:23:37,018
then he'd be alive today

1847
02:23:44,976 --> 02:23:47,018
He didn't commit suicide

1848
02:23:47,768 --> 02:23:48,768
You're right, Dad

1849
02:23:50,310 --> 02:23:51,518
It wasn't suicide...

1850
02:23:54,018 --> 02:23:55,060
It was murder

1851
02:24:11,018 --> 02:24:13,934
<i>Many city roads are
completely submerged</i>

1852
02:24:13,935 --> 02:24:15,893
<i>Traffic has come to a standstill</i>

1853
02:24:29,851 --> 02:24:33,643
Dad...

1854
02:24:34,768 --> 02:24:35,768
Mona?

1855
02:24:39,893 --> 02:24:42,351
Go back, Millimeter.
Why're you following us?

1856
02:24:42,935 --> 02:24:45,185
Why? Your pop owns the road?

1857
02:24:45,351 --> 02:24:47,018
Please help,
we are desperate here!

1858
02:24:48,018 --> 02:24:49,851
You can't send an ambulance?

1859
02:24:50,893 --> 02:24:52,768
Get it from another hospital

1860
02:24:53,435 --> 02:24:56,935
The entire city's flooded, sir.
We're helpless

1861
02:25:00,476 --> 02:25:01,726
Mona, you OK?

1862
02:25:02,310 --> 02:25:03,310
Rancho, Pia

1863
02:25:05,685 --> 02:25:09,518
Rancho, you can't reach here.
Do as I say

1864
02:25:09,851 --> 02:25:14,685
The water bag has burst

1865
02:25:15,726 --> 02:25:18,226
Disconnected! Mona

1866
02:25:23,476 --> 02:25:24,476
Mona!

1867
02:25:28,851 --> 02:25:30,351
Turn on the lights - Where to?

1868
02:25:30,893 --> 02:25:34,810
To the table tennis table
Pia, we're in the common room

1869
02:25:38,810 --> 02:25:40,643
Raju, turn on the web camera

1870
02:25:46,810 --> 02:25:47,935
Where's Mona? Show me

1871
02:25:49,518 --> 02:25:50,518
Hold on

1872
02:25:52,685 --> 02:25:53,685
Here, Pia

1873
02:25:53,851 --> 02:25:56,850
Mona, don't worry. I'm with you

1874
02:25:56,851 --> 02:25:57,851
Pia, I'm dying!

1875
02:25:58,226 --> 02:26:00,810
Rancho, even when
there were no hospitals or docs

1876
02:26:00,976 --> 02:26:02,351
babies were delivered

1877
02:26:02,976 --> 02:26:05,268
You all will deliver this baby

1878
02:26:07,976 --> 02:26:09,518
All is well

1879
02:26:09,685 --> 02:26:12,643
How dare you? I'll kill you

1880
02:26:12,810 --> 02:26:14,810
Dad, stay out of this

1881
02:26:15,810 --> 02:26:18,017
Farhan, get towels and scissors

1882
02:26:18,018 --> 02:26:20,476
Millimeter, get clothes clips
and hot water

1883
02:26:20,768 --> 02:26:22,226
Rancho, cover Mona

1884
02:26:29,810 --> 02:26:31,310
Mona, try pushing

1885
02:26:31,768 --> 02:26:35,685
Push with all your might

1886
02:26:35,976 --> 02:26:38,351
Stop it! I can't do it

1887
02:26:38,601 --> 02:26:40,393
Rancho, check if there's crowning

1888
02:26:41,351 --> 02:26:42,351
Crowning...?

1889
02:26:43,560 --> 02:26:44,560
Get that diagram

1890
02:26:47,393 --> 02:26:50,101
See if the head is coming out

1891
02:26:52,476 --> 02:26:53,768
Check quickly

1892
02:26:54,601 --> 02:26:55,601
Go!

1893
02:26:56,185 --> 02:26:58,643
Go, Rancho, go

1894
02:27:05,935 --> 02:27:08,142
No crowning

1895
02:27:08,143 --> 02:27:09,976
Mona, please push

1896
02:27:12,685 --> 02:27:13,685
Mona!

1897
02:27:16,560 --> 02:27:17,685
She's tired, Pia

1898
02:27:18,143 --> 02:27:21,810
Wake her! If she won't push,
it's a big problem

1899
02:27:22,185 --> 02:27:25,935
They need a vacuum cup
Where will they get one?

1900
02:27:26,143 --> 02:27:28,976
What's a vacuum cup?
How is it used?

1901
02:27:29,268 --> 02:27:30,268
I'll show you

1902
02:27:33,393 --> 02:27:37,685
If the mother's too fatigued to push,
a cup is placed on baby's head

1903
02:27:38,018 --> 02:27:41,768
Suction makes the cup
stick to the head...

1904
02:27:42,518 --> 02:27:44,351
and the baby is pulled out

1905
02:27:44,851 --> 02:27:47,018
I can make this - How?

1906
02:27:47,310 --> 02:27:49,184
With a vacuum cleaner
Vacuum cleaner?

1907
02:27:49,185 --> 02:27:50,309
Yes

1908
02:27:50,310 --> 02:27:52,725
That pressure's too high

1909
02:27:52,726 --> 02:27:54,934
I'll control it
D'you have a vacuum cleaner?

1910
02:27:54,935 --> 02:27:55,976
Yes, in my office

1911
02:27:56,435 --> 02:27:59,143
Farhan, rush and get it
Here's the key

1912
02:28:05,143 --> 02:28:08,560
Mona, push

1913
02:28:09,351 --> 02:28:10,851
Oh my God

1914
02:28:11,768 --> 02:28:12,768
What happened?

1915
02:28:17,560 --> 02:28:19,810
Raju, what happened?
The power's gone

1916
02:28:20,810 --> 02:28:22,309
How'll the vacuum work now?

1917
02:28:22,310 --> 02:28:24,934
Farhan, you get the vacuum,
I'll get the power.

1918
02:28:24,935 --> 02:28:25,935
How?

1919
02:28:26,601 --> 02:28:28,060
Millimeter, get Virus out

1920
02:28:29,476 --> 02:28:32,101
What nonsense is this!

1921
02:28:32,351 --> 02:28:35,893
Not this Virus.
My Virus, the inverter

1922
02:28:36,101 --> 02:28:37,976
Get that, quick - OK

1923
02:28:38,268 --> 02:28:40,393
Raju, wake up the hostel

1924
02:28:40,601 --> 02:28:43,518
Get car batteries, wires,
and a vacuum gauge

1925
02:28:46,393 --> 02:28:49,018
Emergency in the common room!

1926
02:29:19,851 --> 02:29:21,935
- Where's Rancho?
- Here, sir

1927
02:29:22,226 --> 02:29:24,893
Keep the batteries here
...and the wires

1928
02:29:27,185 --> 02:29:30,351
Raju, switch off everything,
connect the inverter to the mains

1929
02:29:35,185 --> 02:29:36,351
Rancho, vacuum cleaner

1930
02:29:37,518 --> 02:29:40,475
Farhan, get your lens cleaner

1931
02:29:40,476 --> 02:29:41,893
- Blower?
- Yeah, get it

1932
02:29:44,643 --> 02:29:45,643
Rancho, blower

1933
02:29:45,810 --> 02:29:47,810
Good. Fix this to the gauge

1934
02:30:14,226 --> 02:30:15,476
Rancho, I'm done

1935
02:30:17,935 --> 02:30:19,060
- All switches off?
- Yes

1936
02:30:20,643 --> 02:30:22,309
Hit the table
and computer switches

1937
02:30:22,310 --> 02:30:23,310
OK

1938
02:30:35,851 --> 02:30:36,935
Raju, turn on the computer

1939
02:30:37,351 --> 02:30:39,018
Farhan, here

1940
02:30:41,143 --> 02:30:43,143
Pia, come here quick

1941
02:30:45,643 --> 02:30:46,726
Love you, Rancho

1942
02:30:47,518 --> 02:30:49,476
Farhan, turn it on - OK

1943
02:30:56,060 --> 02:30:58,060
Pia, how much suction?

1944
02:30:58,476 --> 02:30:59,893
Not more than 0.5

1945
02:31:00,143 --> 02:31:02,143
Farhan, 0.5 - Cover it

1946
02:31:03,726 --> 02:31:04,726
0.5

1947
02:31:07,185 --> 02:31:11,185
Vacuum cleaner baby!
Mother of all deliveries

1948
02:31:12,310 --> 02:31:13,185
Farhan, stop

1949
02:31:13,185 --> 02:31:14,185
OK

1950
02:31:20,435 --> 02:31:21,726
Raju, get on the table

1951
02:31:22,018 --> 02:31:25,143
Push the baby down, like this

1952
02:31:25,351 --> 02:31:26,351
OK

1953
02:31:27,393 --> 02:31:28,393
Farhan, turn it on

1954
02:31:32,893 --> 02:31:35,185
C'mon, you can do it

1955
02:31:36,351 --> 02:31:38,768
C'mon, push

1956
02:31:42,976 --> 02:31:45,518
Do it for Champ

1957
02:31:45,768 --> 02:31:48,185
C'mon, Mona

1958
02:31:49,935 --> 02:31:51,976
He's coming out!

1959
02:31:53,351 --> 02:31:55,101
You can do it

1960
02:31:55,935 --> 02:31:58,268
Yes Mona, push

1961
02:32:06,143 --> 02:32:07,309
Farhan, turn it off

1962
02:32:07,310 --> 02:32:08,310
OK, off

1963
02:32:28,601 --> 02:32:30,351
Two clips,
cut the umbilical cord

1964
02:32:30,685 --> 02:32:32,851
Farhan, two clips on the cord

1965
02:32:33,601 --> 02:32:35,601
Get scissors - Be careful

1966
02:32:36,851 --> 02:32:39,101
Cut at the center, get a towel

1967
02:32:41,935 --> 02:32:44,226
Pia, he's not crying

1968
02:32:48,518 --> 02:32:51,393
Hey Champ!

1969
02:32:52,768 --> 02:32:55,185
Rancho, rub his back

1970
02:32:57,476 --> 02:32:59,476
Hey Champ - Come on, Champ

1971
02:33:01,351 --> 02:33:03,435
No, nothing

1972
02:33:03,935 --> 02:33:04,935
Blow air into his mouth

1973
02:33:12,143 --> 02:33:13,143
C'mon, Champ

1974
02:33:18,518 --> 02:33:19,518
No response

1975
02:33:43,726 --> 02:33:47,310
Hush Mona, say - All is well

1976
02:33:52,601 --> 02:33:53,601
He kicked

1977
02:33:54,851 --> 02:33:55,851
What?

1978
02:33:56,601 --> 02:33:57,851
He kicked

1979
02:34:01,351 --> 02:34:02,643
Say - All is well

1980
02:34:04,310 --> 02:34:11,185
All is well

1981
02:34:52,643 --> 02:34:55,976
<i>If Virus had said, 'My grandson
will be an engineer'</i>

1982
02:34:56,143 --> 02:34:57,976
<i>I would've broken his jaw</i>

1983
02:34:58,685 --> 02:35:01,476
<i>But when he finally spoke,
he stunned us</i>

1984
02:35:01,810 --> 02:35:04,935
What a kick!
Wanna be a footballer?

1985
02:35:06,018 --> 02:35:09,018
Be what you want to be

1986
02:35:25,518 --> 02:35:29,393
Wait - I've not finished with you!

1987
02:35:31,810 --> 02:35:34,351
First day of college,
you'd asked me a question...

1988
02:35:34,726 --> 02:35:37,101
Why didn't astronauts
use a pencil in space?

1989
02:35:37,893 --> 02:35:40,143
If a pencil tip breaks

1990
02:35:40,351 --> 02:35:46,226
it'd float in zero gravity.
Get into eyes, nose, instruments...

1991
02:35:46,393 --> 02:35:48,310
You were wrong

1992
02:35:49,935 --> 02:35:51,768
You cannot be right all the time

1993
02:35:53,893 --> 02:35:54,893
You understand?

1994
02:35:57,351 --> 02:35:58,351
Yes, sir

1995
02:35:59,476 --> 02:36:01,560
This was an important invention

1996
02:36:02,893 --> 02:36:03,893
You understand?

1997
02:36:05,310 --> 02:36:06,310
Yes, sir

1998
02:36:08,726 --> 02:36:16,726
My Director said, 'When you find
an extraordinary student...'

1999
02:36:35,976 --> 02:36:40,393
Go, study!
Pass your exams and leave

2000
02:36:49,310 --> 02:36:51,393
<i>And now, Student of the Year...</i>

2001
02:36:51,643 --> 02:36:54,101
<i>Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad</i>

2002
02:37:11,768 --> 02:37:13,060
Sir, one photo

2003
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:33,976
<i>♪ I wanted to capture all these
memories and take them home ♪</i>

2004

2007
02:38:21,435 --> 02:38:22,435
Untie him

2008
02:38:25,726 --> 02:38:27,601
I'll sue you all in an
American court

2009
02:38:42,101 --> 02:38:43,101
Raju

2010
02:39:01,976 --> 02:39:03,935
Only Rancho can create
a school like this

2011
02:39:04,518 --> 02:39:05,560
But where is he?

2012
02:39:10,060 --> 02:39:11,268
Don't pee here

2013
02:39:12,393 --> 02:39:13,976
Go away creatures

2014
02:39:14,393 --> 02:39:17,435
Don't pee here - I'll smack you

2015
02:39:35,226 --> 02:39:37,393
Bingo! He cannot be far

2016
02:39:48,893 --> 02:39:51,143
Excuse me, where is Ranchhoddas?

2017
02:39:51,310 --> 02:39:53,392
- He's not Ranchhoddas!
- Rancho...

2018
02:39:53,393 --> 02:39:55,560
Chhote... Dammit,
what's his name?

2019
02:39:55,726 --> 02:39:58,393
Calm down. Come with me

2020
02:40:00,893 --> 02:40:01,893
- Where's he?
- Rancho

2021
02:40:09,185 --> 02:40:12,310
Farhan, he's read all your books

2022
02:40:18,643 --> 02:40:24,643
Raju, he reads your blog everyday.
Proudly shares it with the kids

2023
02:40:28,185 --> 02:40:31,643
Remember your helmet, Pia?
It was stolen...

2024
02:40:33,601 --> 02:40:36,768
Who are you? How do you know us?

2025
02:40:37,060 --> 02:40:39,101
- Didn't you recognize me?
- No

2026
02:40:40,060 --> 02:40:44,018
How would you?
Millimeter is now Centimeter

2027
02:40:49,101 --> 02:40:53,560
Not Centimeter, you're Kilometer

2028
02:40:54,435 --> 02:40:55,517
How did you get here?

2029
02:40:55,518 --> 02:40:58,726
I got a letter with
a train ticket inside

2030
02:40:59,018 --> 02:41:02,726
It said - 'Miss being in school?
Catch this train'... I did

2031
02:41:04,351 --> 02:41:05,435
That rascal Rancho!

2032
02:41:09,643 --> 02:41:10,643
Where is that idiot?

2033
02:41:21,810 --> 02:41:23,685
Dorje, you fly it

2034
02:41:38,685 --> 02:41:44,143
<i>Every night you ride into my dreams
on a scooter, dressed as a bride</i>

2035
02:41:45,101 --> 02:41:47,351
<i>Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet</i>

2036
02:41:48,018 --> 02:41:50,726
<i>and come close to kiss me</i>

2037
02:41:54,351 --> 02:41:55,751
Couldn't you tell me
before leaving?

2038
02:41:57,935 --> 02:41:58,935
No

2039
02:42:00,560 --> 02:42:01,560
Sorry

2040
02:42:01,851 --> 02:42:02,851
Did you marry?

2041
02:42:03,268 --> 02:42:07,476
What? No

2042
02:42:08,476 --> 02:42:11,060
- You?
- Almost... Idiot

2043
02:42:18,685 --> 02:42:19,685
So?

2044
02:42:21,018 --> 02:42:22,018
So what?

2045
02:42:22,518 --> 02:42:23,810
Do you love someone?

2046
02:42:28,268 --> 02:42:29,268
Yes

2047
02:42:35,143 --> 02:42:36,143
Who?

2048
02:42:37,310 --> 02:42:38,310
You

2049
02:43:03,893 --> 02:43:07,060
See, the noses don't collide,
stupid

2050
02:43:08,310 --> 02:43:09,310
That's right!

2051
02:43:09,393 --> 02:43:10,476
Rancho

2052
02:43:12,018 --> 02:43:13,018
Hi... Farhan!

2053
02:43:13,060 --> 02:43:15,143
Screw your 'Hi'

2054
02:43:15,601 --> 02:43:20,310
Hey, listen to me...
No, you listen to me

2055
02:43:20,518 --> 02:43:22,768
I can explain everything

2056
02:43:23,893 --> 02:43:24,810
Hi... Raju!

2057
02:43:24,811 --> 02:43:26,685
How we hunted for you!

2058
02:43:29,601 --> 02:43:33,685
Didn't have a coin
for one phone call?

2059
02:43:35,768 --> 02:43:38,018
Add a couple from me too

2060
02:43:38,601 --> 02:43:43,768
Rascal, scoundrel Let him go now

2061
02:43:43,935 --> 02:43:44,935
OK OK, enough

2062
02:43:46,226 --> 02:43:47,976
On your feet, c'mon

2063
02:44:18,018 --> 02:44:19,726
Having fun, idiots?

2064
02:44:20,018 --> 02:44:21,851
Hey... Hi Chatur

2065
02:44:22,185 --> 02:44:27,226
Ranchhoddas Chanchad.
How do you do, Mr. Teacher?

2066
02:44:27,685 --> 02:44:34,435
Wow, you're a teacher in a village -
A for Apple, B for Ball...

2067
02:44:36,393 --> 02:44:41,101
Our trains left together.
But yours traveled in reverse...

2068
02:44:41,685 --> 02:44:44,560
from engineer to primary teacher

2069
02:44:46,768 --> 02:44:49,643
What's your salary, Chanchad?
5000Rs?

2070
02:44:50,060 --> 02:44:51,810
For me that's $100

2071
02:44:52,268 --> 02:44:55,643
My son's pocket money is
more than your salary

2072
02:44:55,851 --> 02:44:58,601
Cut the crap
Crap is what he gave us

2073
02:44:58,810 --> 02:45:03,851
Wanted to change the education
system, change the world

2074
02:45:04,101 --> 02:45:06,643
Finally what does he change?
Kids' diapers

2075
02:45:07,143 --> 02:45:08,543
You gonna break his jaw
or should I?

2076
02:45:08,726 --> 02:45:09,726
Just relax

2077
02:45:09,727 --> 02:45:16,476
Remember I'd said
one day you'd cry and I'd laugh?

2078
02:45:18,185 --> 02:45:24,935
Sign here.
Accept - You lost, I won!

2079
02:45:25,226 --> 02:45:28,226
'Declaration of Defeat'!
Unbelievable, man

2080
02:45:28,435 --> 02:45:30,476
Chatur - Crazy guy

2081
02:45:32,310 --> 02:45:36,601
Hey, this is Virus's pen!
You pinched it?

2082
02:45:37,060 --> 02:45:38,435
Forget it, man

2083
02:45:39,143 --> 02:45:42,810
This is for winners, not losers

2084
02:45:43,935 --> 02:45:50,893
If your school ever needs help,
call my assistant for a donation

2085
02:45:53,060 --> 02:45:55,851
A for Apple, B for Ball...

2086
02:45:57,393 --> 02:46:00,143
He hasn't changed at all!
Ignore him

2087
02:46:00,310 --> 02:46:01,768
He's full of crap

2088
02:46:02,143 --> 02:46:06,518
Good news is your name
isn't Ranchhoddas Chanchad

2089
02:46:06,935 --> 02:46:10,935
Imagine, after marriage,
I'm Pia Chanchad - Yuck!

2090
02:46:11,726 --> 02:46:13,185
By the way,
what is your real name?

2091
02:46:14,060 --> 02:46:15,060
Phunsukh Wangdu

2092
02:46:15,768 --> 02:46:16,768
Wangdu?

2093
02:46:16,851 --> 02:46:17,851
Pia Wangdu!

2094
02:46:18,393 --> 02:46:20,101
You mean you're a scientist?

2095
02:46:20,351 --> 02:46:21,643
You have 400 patents?

2096
02:46:21,810 --> 02:46:23,725
I won't change my name
after marriage

2097
02:46:23,726 --> 02:46:25,434
You mean you're Chatur's Wangdu?

2098
02:46:25,435 --> 02:46:27,684
It's you the Japanese are wooing?

2099
02:46:27,685 --> 02:46:28,685
I don't like Wangdu

2100
02:46:29,185 --> 02:46:31,351
Are you a scientist
or a teacher?

2101
02:46:31,810 --> 02:46:33,809
Scientist,
but I also teach children

2102
02:46:33,810 --> 02:46:35,975
So you are THE Phunsukh Wangdu?

2103
02:46:35,976 --> 02:46:37,101
Yes, yes!

2104
02:46:38,393 --> 02:46:41,268
Hey Silencer
Hey Chatur, come back

2105
02:46:42,560 --> 02:46:43,643
Take that

2106
02:46:45,226 --> 02:46:47,476
Wait, I'll stop him

2107
02:46:55,393 --> 02:46:58,976
Mr. Wangdu,
I can't believe it's you

2108
02:46:59,518 --> 02:47:00,850
I'm sorry, Mr. Chatur

2109
02:47:00,851 --> 02:47:03,143
I can't sign the deal
with your company

2110
02:47:03,685 --> 02:47:05,685
What sir? Why sir?

2111
02:47:05,935 --> 02:47:08,726
How do I sign, man?
You took my pen

2112
02:47:10,643 --> 02:47:12,601
What pen, sir?
I didn't get you...

2113
02:47:12,976 --> 02:47:17,143
The one in your hand -
Virus's pen

2114
02:47:20,685 --> 02:47:22,143
Mr. Wangdu...?

2115
02:47:22,351 --> 02:47:23,518
Yes, Chatur?

2116
02:47:24,351 --> 02:47:26,310
A for Apple, B for Ball is...

2117
02:47:29,476 --> 02:47:31,101
...S for Screwed

2118
02:47:38,268 --> 02:47:42,351
You got me, Rancho -
I mean, Mr. Wangdu

2119
02:47:42,768 --> 02:47:44,351
Totally floored me. Good one

2120
02:47:45,060 --> 02:47:49,310
I hope our personal problems
won't affect this deal

2121
02:47:49,518 --> 02:47:52,685
Hey Chatur - take that

2122
02:47:53,351 --> 02:47:55,310
I was just joking, man

2123
02:47:55,726 --> 02:47:59,560
Deep down,
I knew you'd do great things

2124
02:48:00,601 --> 02:48:02,475
You're fibbing

2125
02:48:02,476 --> 02:48:04,517
No, really, I swear

2126
02:48:04,518 --> 02:48:06,476
Rancho - 100, Chatur - 0

2127
02:48:06,893 --> 02:48:09,185
You win, I lose.
You don't believe me?

2128
02:48:10,643 --> 02:48:12,059
Beware of farts

2129
02:48:12,060 --> 02:48:16,434
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering

2130
02:48:16,435 --> 02:48:18,768
Free advice, Mr. Wangdu -
Run for your life!

2131
02:48:22,518 --> 02:48:26,560
Rancho, I'll lose my job, man.
I have small kids...

2132
02:48:27,560 --> 02:48:30,060
<i>His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas
had correctly stated</i>

2133
02:48:30,310 --> 02:48:35,351
<i>Follow Excellence... Success
will chase you, pants down</i>
