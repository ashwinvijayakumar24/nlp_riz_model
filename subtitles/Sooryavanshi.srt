1
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,250
{\an8}You're still at work?

2
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,666
I've been waiting for you.

3
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,500
What's the hurry?

4
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:59,416
You don't call, but as your son is coming,
this is the third call.

5
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,166
<i>-I'm leaving.</i>
-Okay.

6
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,166
You are late.

7
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,708
-Let's go.
-Take this.

8
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:17,541
I still have so many chores
to finish at home.

9
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:21,458
Why are you so stressed out?
I know you miss Veer a lot.

10
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,958
He'll stay with us for a few days.

11
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,500
{\an8}<i>On 12th March 1993,</i>

12
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:33,291
{\an8}<i>Mumbai witnessed</i> <i>12 bombings</i>
<i>in various places,</i>

13
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,958
{\an8}<i>the first terrorist attack</i>
<i>of this kind in India.</i>

14
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,375
{\an8}<i>These blasts introduced the Mumbai police</i>

15
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:42,083
{\an8}<i>and the common man</i>
<i>to something that shook the nation,</i>

16
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:43,625
{\an8}<i>RDX.</i>

17
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:46,625
{\an8}<i>Mumbai police</i>
<i>worked tirelessly on this case.</i>

18
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:51,916
{\an8}<i>The officer who arrested many suspects</i>,
<i>solving the case in just under 48 hours,</i>

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,791
{\an8}<i>was Inspector Kabir Shroff.</i>

20
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:56,666
{\an8}We heard the masterminds
behind these attacks,

21
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,458
{\an8}Bilal Ahmed and Tiger<i>,</i>
have fled from India.

22
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,708
{\an8}<i>That journalist was right.</i>

23
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:06,666
{\an8}<i>Tiger and Bilal fled the country</i>
<i>two days before the blast.</i>

24
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,916
{\an8}<i>Tiger went to Iran.</i>

25
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,375
{\an8}<i>And Bilal Ahmed went to POK</i>

26
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,666
{\an8}<i>to join Omar Hafeez.</i>

27
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,625
{\an8}<i>Omar Hafeez used to do</i>
<i>all of ISI's illegal work.</i>

28
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:23,916
{\an8}<i>Omar was also instrumental in training</i>
<i>the '93 bombers in making explosives.</i>

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,208
{\an8}We've also heard that 1000 kg. of RDX
was brought into Mumbai.

30
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,958
{\an8}But only 400 kg.
was used in these serial blasts

31
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,333
{\an8}and 600 kg. is still missing.

32
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,750
{\an8}Is this correct?

33
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,833
{\an8}<i>Nobody knew</i>
<i>if this was true or just a rumor.</i>

34
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,375
{\an8}<i>Only Kabir Shroff knew</i>

35
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:43,041
{\an8}<i>that 600 kg. </i>of <i>RDX</i>
<i>is buried somewhere in India.</i>

36
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:47,208
{\an8}<i>And that it was buried by Bilal Ahmed.</i>

37
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:55,125
{\an8}Bilal, you will stay with us now.

38
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:01,333
{\an8}<i>In 1999, ISI helped Omar</i>
<i>start a terrorist organization,</i>

39
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,666
{\an8}<i>called Lashkar.</i>

40
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,916
{\an8}<i>And in turn,</i>
<i>ISI used them in the Kargil war.</i>

41
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,958
{\an8}<i>But in war, Omar's eldest son,</i>

42
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:13,000
{\an8}<i>Imaad Hafeez,</i>
<i>was killed by the Indian army.</i>

43
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:25,666
{\an8}<i>Hearing this,</i>
<i>Omar's younger sons, Riyaaz and Raza,</i>

44
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,833
{\an8}<i>left their studies in London</i>
<i>and returned to Muzaffarabad.</i>

45
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:37,625
{\an8}<i>Father</i>, we won't go back now.

46
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,875
{\an8}I promise you, sister-in-law,

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,083
{\an8}no one across the border
will ever be safe again.

48
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:11,333
{\an8}Next week, Mohali is hosting a cricket
match between India and Pakistan.

49
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:15,125
{\an8}Two-day visas have been issued
for all of you to go to India.

50
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,875
{\an8}You will go to India,
but will never return.

51
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,833
{\an8}My friend, Kader Usmani,

52
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:23,875
{\an8}has made arrangements for you
to stay and work in different cities.

53
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,458
{\an8}<i>Although Pakistanis,</i>

54
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:29,541
{\an8}<i>they were living ordinary lives in India,</i>
<i>with Indian identities.</i>

55
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:33,750
{\an8}<i>They were everywhere around us.</i>
<i>They could've been anyone.</i>

56
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:38,041
{\an8}<i>Maybe the watchman at your building</i>
<i>or an employee in your office.</i>

57
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:41,125
{\an8}<i>It was hard for the police</i>
<i>to identify and arrest them.</i>

58
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:45,666
{\an8}<i>Because till their commander issued</i>
<i>an order, they wouldn't harm anyone.</i>

59
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,750
{\an8}You only have one contact now.

60
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,583
{\an8}Your Area Commander-in-Chief, Riyaaz.

61
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,583
{\an8}<i>Mukhtar, the son of Omar's</i>
<i>loyal bodyguard, Bashir,</i>

62
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,375
{\an8}<i>was going to India to protect Riyaaz.</i>

63
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,375
{\an8}<i>And thus Lashkar's</i>
<i>sleeper cell came into being.</i>

64
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,041
{\an8}Raza uncle and I…

65
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,833
{\an8}spent the best years of our lives
at London University.

66
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,583
{\an8}You are going there too.

67
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,291
{\an8}Study hard.

68
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,291
{\an8}A lot is going to happen here anyway.

69
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,791
{\an8}You shouldn't worry.

70
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,291
{\an8}Raza, take care of our parents.

71
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:44,791
{\an8}What's on your mind?

72
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:50,250
{\an8}I'm wondering when all of this will end.

73
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,708
{\an8}You should be wondering
about where it all began.

74
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:02,083
{\an8}Sixty years ago,
some illiterate and power-hungry people

75
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,250
{\an8}divided the nation over religion.

76
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
{\an8}People like us bore the brunt of it.

77
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:13,083
{\an8}Our families were forced
out of their homes, their country.

78
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,041
{\an8}In front of a five-year-old kid,

79
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:20,583
{\an8}they beheaded his father,
killed his mother.

80
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,250
{\an8}And with his sister…

81
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:28,791
{\an8}Even after coming here,
he was labeled an immigrant.

82
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,791
{\an8}That five-year-old kid was me.

83
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,833
{\an8}But all of this…

84
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:41,750
{\an8}-What will you achieve with all this?
-Sacrifices have to be made.

85
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,083
{\an8}Or what is the difference
between us and those bureaucrats?

86
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,666
{\an8}India changed my destiny.

87
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,708
{\an8}Now, I will change India's destiny.

88
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,041
<i>If only our elders had paid heed to this,</i>

89
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,958
<i>we wouldn’t be paying penalties</i>
<i>for their mistakes.</i>

90
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,041
{\an8}Yes, Mr. Kabir.

91
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,458
{\an8}-<i>Is the CM with you?</i>
-Yes, he is.

92
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,375
{\an8}Put him through.

93
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,833
Yes, Kabir.

94
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,166
<i>I've been trying to contact you</i>
<i>for the last three hours.</i>

95
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,625
I was on a flight. What is it?

96
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,250
<i>I need to talk to you urgently.</i>
<i>Can I come over?</i>

97
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll come to the ATS headquarters.

98
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:19,833
Kabir, every time I get a late-night call
from the Anti-Terrorism Squad,

99
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,083
I have sleepless nights.

100
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,416
We've located Riyaaz Hafeez.

101
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:32,000
For 15 years, these 40 sleeper agents
have been hiding in India.

102
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,875
Investigations show
that these two dead suspects

103
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:40,750
used to frequently meet with a hotelier,
Rajbir Rathod in Jaisalmer.

104
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:47,458
This Rajbir Rathod
is Lashkar chief Omar Hafeez's son.

105
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,583
Send a team to Jaisalmer now
and arrest this bastard.

106
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,958
We didn't have time to seek permission.
My team is en route to Jaisalmer.

107
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,708
That lunatic?

108
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,625
Sir, Vivaan. Not Balwaan.

109
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,250
Two things haven't changed for years.

110
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,791
Your hairstyle
and your habit of forgetting names.

111
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,333
Sir, once we nab Riyaaz,
you're bound to make it to the front page.

112
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, but only God knows
if it'll be with a medal or as a martyr.

113
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,625
Look in front, Yede.

114
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,291
Sir, not Yede, it's Bhide.

115
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,875
-Sent the cash to the bank?
-Yes.

116
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,083
I've never tasted
such delicious food in Jaisalmer.

117
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,375
-Are you the owner?
-My husband and I own it.

118
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,458
What's up?

119
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:27,416
-She is saying that she loved our food.
-A lot.

120
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,041
I hope you will visit again.

121
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,041
Of course.

122
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,000
Can I take a selfie with you guys?

123
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,958
Sir, it's definitely him.

124
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:01,791
Inform the local police.

125
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,416
-What will you have?
-I'll tell you.

126
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,166
Shall we go to Mumbai now?

127
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,666
-Switch on the light, Kide.
-It's Bhide.

128
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,041
As per Central Agency,
you're Lashkar Chief Omar Hafeez's son.

129
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,791
In 2007, you came from Pakistan
on a tourist visa

130
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:34,958
to watch the India-Pakistan cricket match
in Mohali, but never left.

131
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:40,875
For 13 years,
you've been living here as Rajbir Rathod,

132
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:44,083
and you married
an Indian girl, Jyoti Gupta.

133
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:50,083
In Central Agency's report, you were
involved in the 2011 Mumbai train blast.

134
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,208
After Srinagar, Ahmedabad.

135
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,958
Maybe your agency doesn't know.

136
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,541
That blast was also my doing.

137
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,833
As per our intelligence,
there are 40 more people

138
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:12,750
living in India for years
as Lashkar's sleeper cell.

139
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,083
Their time hasn't come yet.

140
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:20,666
When it does,
you won't have to look for them.

141
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,250
Imbecile.

142
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,041
We found you,
we'll also find your comrades.

143
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:33,541
-What do you gain from this?
-What do you gain when you do your job?

144
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:34,958
Same thing.

145
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,208
I sleep better at night.

146
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,083
Like I did that night.

147
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,333
Taj 26/11… you remember, don't you?

148
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,333
If you try your heroics with me,

149
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:55,500
I'll kill you and bury you
under this safe house.

150
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,416
No one will find out here in India,

151
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,875
nor your father
will ever hear about it in Pakistan.

152
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:19,750
I heard that you solved the case
in just two days.

153
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:24,541
Only Tiger and Bilal managed to evade you.

154
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,166
You know a lot about me,

155
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:35,083
but we know that after 1993,
Bilal was hiding in your father's house.

156
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,250
I kept telling him that it is wrong.

157
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,166
Riyaaz is now in Indian custody.

158
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,833
I don't know what they will do to my son.

159
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,125
Father.

160
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,750
Riyaaz will be hanged now.

161
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,375
Those Indians will kill him.

162
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:08,375
No noose in India is strong enough

163
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,875
to kill Riyaaz Hafeez.

164
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,000
He is my son.

165
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:15,666
He is a soldier.

166
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,125
He will die facing the bullet.

167
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:23,583
The satisfaction I derived
from solving the 1993 blast case

168
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:28,166
is equal to the regret
for not arresting Bilal.

169
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,041
Sir, how can I forget '93?

170
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,166
I lost my parents in those blasts.

171
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,333
And nobody regrets it more than me.

172
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,666
It was India's first experience
with serial blasts.

173
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,458
In those blasts,

174
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,041
some lost their business,
some lost their courage

175
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,375
and some lost their family.

176
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,250
Department and media think that

177
00:20:55,333 --> 00:21:00,208
I am still tracking Bilal
because I want to settle the score.

178
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,541
This is not true.

179
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:08,041
In 1993, one ton of RDX was brought in,
but only 400 kg. was used,

180
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,958
and shook the whole of Mumbai.

181
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,291
600 kg. is still buried somewhere.

182
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:29,666
And the scary part is
that only Bilal has this information.

183
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,625
Bilal, it's time to go to India.

184
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,333
Go and confirm Mumbai police's suspicions

185
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:44,041
that for the last 27 years,
600 kg. of RDX is buried

186
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,333
under their own soil.

187
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,625
Okay, brother.

188
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,375
Raza,

189
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:05,958
inform Mukhtar and Usmani
that Bilal is coming back to India.

190
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:15,833
-Go home, Vidya. I'll lock the garage.
-Don't be late as usual.

191
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:16,750
Yes, all right.

192
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,875
I went to your garage,
they said you're here.

193
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,541
You fixed my vehicle but I never paid you.

194
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:25,958
Please don't worry.

195
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,083
I know you are good for it.

196
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,625
You shouldn't trust anybody nowadays.

197
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,000
Here is the money.

198
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,791
How did you lose your two fingers?

199
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,625
This… happened during the Afghanistan war.

200
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,791
I used my hands for a bomb explosion.

201
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,500
You're ridiculous.

202
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,916
What are you saying? He's joking.

203
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,833
I'll leave now. Namaste, ma'am.

204
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,291
You think you're funny?

205
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,166
I'll serve you dinner, come home soon.

206
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:43,750
Thank you for transferring me
to your department.

207
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,708
Your father worked with us for many years.

208
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:51,583
I'm sure that you will follow
in his footsteps.

209
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,458
We're late because of you.

210
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,708
What happened? You guys are late.

211
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:57,875
We're always late because of him.

212
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:01,541
I don't know why women
take so long to get ready.

213
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,416
-What?
-How are you, Garbhvati?

214
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,083
Sir, her name is Saraswati, not Garbhvati.

215
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:16,375
Sir, you and Ria are celebrating
Aryan's birthday together after one year.

216
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,625
You must be very happy.

217
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500
-I am and I am not.
-What do you mean?

218
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:24,375
Ria is moving to Australia
for good, with Aryan.

219
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:31,166
It's been a year since that incident.
How long will you stay apart?

220
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:34,916
Two people so different from each other…

221
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
But still fell in love, got married.

222
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:42,875
Ria will definitely
come back to you one day.

223
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,333
-Vandana…
-I'll be right back.

224
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:10,000
Ma'am, that…

225
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:44,875
How are you?

226
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,875
Any news about Tunde?

227
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:54,875
It's Munde, not Tunde.
We are looking for him.

228
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:57,875
He shot you. We will not spare him.

229
00:25:57,958 --> 00:26:00,666
When can I leave?
I need to get back to work.

230
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,750
Look at your condition.

231
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,958
I mean, um…

232
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:08,291
It's a minor injury.
I'll be fine in two days.

233
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:12,625
Yeah. Minor injuries
are not a big deal for him.

234
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:15,000
He risks his life to do his job.

235
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:19,041
Really? If the bullet
had hit him two inches higher,

236
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:22,208
he wouldn't have a life left to risk.

237
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:28,208
This is not a police station.
It's a hospital and I'm the doctor.

238
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:30,791
I'll decide when you can leave.

239
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:42,000
You were shot twice.
Anything could've happened.

240
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:42,916
Nothing did.

241
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,125
You know, sir.
She walked to the temple to pray for you.

242
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:49,791
Get better soon, sir.

243
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,125
Without you,
I'm scared to send him to work.

244
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:54,250
Hey, remote.

245
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:57,625
If not for you,
I wouldn't let him be a cop.

246
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:59,291
He is very courageous.

247
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:02,416
This bed is remote-controlled.
May I lie down?

248
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,041
-Knock yourself out.
-What are you doing?

249
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,958
What if it breaks?

250
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:11,208
-Is it rising?
-Yes, it's rising.

251
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:20,625
-Put your feet down.
-Okay. Higher…

252
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,958
-How are you feeling?
-Great!

253
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,041
Good.

254
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:26,625
-And who is the patient?
-He is.

255
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:29,375
What are you doing on the patient's bed?

256
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:31,291
Up! Get up!

257
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,916
What's going on here? Is this a club?

258
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,125
People come to a hospital
for treatment, not entertainment.

259
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,416
-Are you a police officer too?
-A teacher.

260
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,666
-She is my wife.
-He is your husband?

261
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,333
-You're right, Doctor…
-Dr. Malaria.

262
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:55,500
Ria, not malaria.

263
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,708
Doctors are usually
very polite with the patients.

264
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:05,041
But why are you always angry?

265
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:07,583
Anger suits patients like you.

266
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:11,458
Make sure there are
no more complaints against you.

267
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,083
Why are you here?

268
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:21,916
Don't scold me. I was looking for you.

269
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:23,750
I wanted to talk with you.

270
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:25,958
In private.

271
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,125
Are you deaf?

272
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:39,166
-Did you eat?
-No.

273
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:44,458
This <i>idli </i>is quite big.

274
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:47,958
Delicious.

275
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:54,125
These guys think you are a tyrant,
a rude, and snobbish person.

276
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:57,958
-Not me. These guys.
-Shut up! No, ma'am. I…

277
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:58,875
Let it be.

278
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:02,791
-Dr. Hernia, I wanted to--
-Ria, not Hernia.

279
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:05,500
-I want to discuss this.
-You have a hernia?

280
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:09,166
Not hernia. I keep forgetting names.

281
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,250
I mix up Ramesh with Suresh,
and Ramesh with Suresh.

282
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,041
Don't laugh.
Give me some medicine, please.

283
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:20,583
This disease is embarrassing.
I can't bear it now.

284
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:23,125
There is no such disease, you idiot.

285
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:27,041
That's why you can't remember names.

286
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:33,166
You mean to say that I am a police officer
who is lazy? You are mistaken.

287
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,916
Now, look how quickly
I got this flower for you.

288
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,583
Please take it. I'm not lazy.

289
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:06,208
<i>My heart has synced with yours</i>

290
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:10,250
<i>There has to be a reason</i>

291
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:14,375
<i>I am in love</i>

292
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:22,208
<i>You should know</i>

293
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:25,750
<i>In this whole world</i>

294
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:30,416
<i>You are the only one for me</i>

295
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,583
<i>I have met so many</i>

296
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:37,500
<i>But no one was like you</i>

297
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:41,333
<i>My heart</i>

298
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:45,791
<i>It didn't deter, it went straight to you</i>

299
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:49,500
<i>O' my beloved</i>

300
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:53,166
<i>O' my beloved</i>

301
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,250
<i>Accept me for who I am</i>

302
00:30:57,333 --> 00:31:00,833
<i>O' my beloved</i>

303
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:05,750
<i>Come and hold me</i>

304
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:08,791
<i>Belong to me</i>

305
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:12,125
<i>O' my beloved</i>

306
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:15,833
<i>O' my beloved</i>

307
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:20,250
<i>Accept me for who I am</i>

308
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:23,666
<i>O' my beloved</i>

309
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:43,958
<i>May our conversations never end</i>

310
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:47,958
<i>May such meetings always extend</i>

311
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:52,291
<i>When you are with me</i>

312
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:55,916
<i>It feels magical</i>

313
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,291
<i>Let it happen if it is meant to</i>

314
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:03,416
<i>Let it lose itself if it is meant to</i>

315
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:07,708
<i>Nothing is possible between us</i>
<i>If we stay apart</i>

316
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:11,541
<i>Let me come closer to your heart</i>

317
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:14,416
<i>I have met so many</i>

318
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,166
<i>But no one was like you</i>

319
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:22,166
<i>My heart</i>

320
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,916
<i>It didn't deter, it went straight to you</i>

321
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,125
<i>O' my beloved</i>

322
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,458
<i>O' my beloved</i>

323
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:37,625
<i>Accept me for who I am</i>

324
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:41,708
<i>O' my beloved</i>

325
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:46,166
<i>Come and hold me</i>

326
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:49,375
<i>Belong to me</i>

327
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:08,375
<i>O' my beloved</i>

328
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:11,791
<i>O' my beloved</i>

329
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:16,458
<i>Accept me for who I am</i>

330
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:20,166
<i>O' my beloved</i>

331
00:33:25,416 --> 00:33:27,750
Let's go there. I'm hungry.

332
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:30,250
-Okay, let's have pizza today.
-Yes, Vivaan.

333
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:33,125
Sir, Yaakub is in the Central Mall now.

334
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:36,708
How long will you take to get there?

335
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:40,041
We're on our way,
but still 20 minutes away.

336
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,333
I'll get there before you.

337
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,708
-What happened?
-Nothing.

338
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,500
Let's go to the mall.
Aryan and I are hungry.

339
00:33:57,083 --> 00:34:00,166
You two wait in the parking lot.
I'll be right back.

340
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,125
-Why in the parking lot?
-I have some work.

341
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:10,250
No, nothing.

342
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,958
Hey. Reverse! Go back.

343
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,125
What are you doing? Aryan is in the car.

344
00:34:40,916 --> 00:34:42,916
You bloody scoundrel.

345
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,958
Move. Step aside!

346
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,708
Hurry up! Move!

347
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,083
Move!

348
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:51,000
Doctor, hurry! Take him.

349
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:52,500
Sir, you stay back.

350
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:42,833
Aryan is fine.

351
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:09,041
You knew it wasn't safe there
and you still took us.

352
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:12,250
You didn't think about Aryan?

353
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:15,250
I was going to leave you both
in the parking lot,

354
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,291
I had no idea he'd come there.

355
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:22,208
And if… If I hadn't stopped them today,
they'd have killed many innocents.

356
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:24,916
So,
is just collateral damage to you?

357
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:28,625
Other cops in the city
are also doing their job.

358
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:34,208
But no one risks
their own child's life for their job.

359
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:36,083
Ria, it won't happen again.

360
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:40,208
Soorya, if something
happens to me someday,

361
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:42,500
that's my destiny.

362
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:46,791
Because I fell in love with you
without a second thought.

363
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,083
I married you.

364
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:51,250
But I can't let anything happen to my son.

365
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:58,083
When a girl used to look at you,
she used to feel safe.

366
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:04,291
Now, when a mother looks at you,
she is afraid of you.

367
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,791
Stay away from us.

368
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:10,375
I don't need you and neither does Aryan.

369
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:12,625
Do you realize what you are saying?

370
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:17,458
Life presents us with choices every day.

371
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:20,708
The only difference is

372
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:24,625
you chose your job over your son.

373
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:29,458
And I am choosing my son
over our relationship.

374
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:31,000
Ria, just hear--

375
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:35,583
Not today.

376
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:57,250
Look. Open this. I'll show you.

377
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:07,750
Aryan wanted to celebrate
his birthday together before leaving.

378
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:19,791
Soorya, I need your signatures
in the embassy to take Aryan to Australia.

379
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,083
I'll be there whenever you need me.

380
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:39,250
Papa, I don't want to go
to Australia with mom.

381
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,833
I want to stay here with both of you.

382
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:45,250
Do something, Papa<i>. </i>Please.

383
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:59,375
Mr. Soorya will be lonely when you leave.

384
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:00,291
Don't cheat.

385
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,291
You must see me as the villain here…

386
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:11,000
but I'm doing this for my son.

387
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:14,291
-How's everything at school?
-Good.

388
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,208
Ask him.

389
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:21,875
Sir, why don't you give it a try?

390
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:26,000
Maybe she'll change her mind
if you speak to her.

391
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:35,416
When Mr. Kabir explains in his deep voice,

392
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,125
Ria will get convinced.

393
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:38,375
What's happening?

394
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:42,000
Uh… sir, Kabir Sir has gone
to speak with Ria.

395
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:47,125
-I heard you want to move to Australia.
-Yes.

396
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,875
Look, Ria,

397
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:53,375
marriage is a union of two people.

398
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:57,291
A union of a man and a woman.

399
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,041
Like, you know,
this pistol is loaded with bullets.

400
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:07,958
Now<i>,</i> these two share
a beautiful relationship, a bond.

401
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:12,958
But when you separate them,
then both are useless.

402
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:16,333
Who sent him there?

403
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:20,666
He did. He said. So I asked…

404
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:24,625
Yes. Absolutely, sir.

405
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:26,750
It's just that, Ria…

406
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:32,041
decisions made when you are angry
are usually wrong.

407
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:35,416
You know a lot about marriage.

408
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:40,083
Then why aren't you married yet?

409
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,416
It's hard to explain why I never married.

410
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:02,000
My shoelaces are undone, idiots.

411
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:14,625
I've come from Delhi.
So I don't come bearing good news.

412
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:20,666
Three days post Riyaaz Hafeez's arrest,
a meeting was held in Muzaffarabad.

413
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:25,125
As you all know,
after Section 370 was scrapped in Kashmir,

414
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:30,541
it has become impossible
for terrorist organizations like Lashkar

415
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:33,500
to infiltrate or send arms
and ammunition into India.

416
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:38,083
That's why they will activate
their sleeper cell in our country.

417
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,458
But according to our information,

418
00:42:43,541 --> 00:42:46,208
Lashkar's next target will be Mumbai.

419
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,166
While tracking Lashkar's transactions,
ATS found some new information.

420
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:08,833
The sources that are funding
Omar Hafeez's Madrasa in POK

421
00:43:08,916 --> 00:43:12,666
are also funding an India-based foundation
called Noor-E-Aman.

422
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,000
And he is the chairman of this foundation.

423
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:20,333
He lives in Padgha,
about 50 km. away from Mumbai.

424
00:43:20,416 --> 00:43:22,958
A politically well-connected
religious leader.

425
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:26,041
So, we can't arrest him
without any concrete proof.

426
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:29,333
It'll not just be a political issue,
we risk communal violence too.

427
00:43:29,416 --> 00:43:33,791
Sir, I think ATS should call
Kader Usmani for interrogation.

428
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:38,375
Leave the political issues to me.
Summon him.

429
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,375
Father wants to meet you.

430
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:51,666
-Yes, call him.
-Father.

431
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:57,416
How are you, Mr. Khan?

432
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,000
-When did you get back from Ajmer?
-This morning.

433
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,916
-Offerings from Khwaja Gareeb Nawaaz.
-Thank you.

434
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:06,833
Sir, Usmani is here.

435
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:09,250
-Get him.
-Yes, sir.

436
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:16,375
Mumbai police summoned me
after a long time. Tell me.

437
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:21,000
Mr. Usmani, we have heard
that the funding source

438
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:22,708
of your trust Noor-E-Aman,

439
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:25,875
is the same as that
of the terrorist organization, Lashkar.

440
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:31,375
Look, Officer, our trust receives funds
from all across the globe.

441
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:34,083
We don't do background checks
for every source.

442
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:36,416
-Rafique.
-Yes.

443
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,416
Let him meet our accountant.
That will pacify him.

444
00:44:39,916 --> 00:44:41,333
-I'll leave.
-No!

445
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:48,000
You have come after such a long time.
Let's talk some more.

446
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:55,291
According to the IB report,
11 Indian kids have joined ISIS in Syria.

447
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:58,375
Out of which, three kids,
Javed, Mushtak, and Ahmed,

448
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:00,625
are from Padgha and it's your area.

449
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:05,250
And they frequented your residence
before they left for Syria.

450
00:45:06,583 --> 00:45:08,875
There are more complaints against you.

451
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:13,708
You give inciting speeches and mislead
innocent children in the name of religion.

452
00:45:15,041 --> 00:45:19,583
Who are you to tell me who is misled
and who is on the right path?

453
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:26,541
Do you even know
the plight of Muslims in India?

454
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,041
The plight of Muslims?

455
00:45:32,916 --> 00:45:33,750
Usmani…

456
00:45:36,458 --> 00:45:37,458
do you know who he is?

457
00:45:38,666 --> 00:45:39,541
Naem Khan.

458
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:43,125
He's been an honest police officer
for 30 years.

459
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:48,125
Now, his son, Abbas, is a capable officer
of our Anti-Terrorism Squad.

460
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:54,000
Mr. Khan is retired,
but he's ready to die for his country.

461
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:56,125
These are the Muslims of India.

462
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:00,625
We don't know
which Muslims you are talking about.

463
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:07,125
Usmani,

464
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:11,250
Mumbai police don't check your religion
on your passport before shooting.

465
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,916
We shoot on looking
at the criminal records.

466
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:16,958
We are investigating your record too.

467
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:20,041
I will put you behind bars soon.

468
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:28,041
When you want to see Maharashtra burn,

469
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,375
come and arrest me. <i>Allah hafiz</i>.

470
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,916
Remember your place.

471
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,791
Do you remember 1977, Mahim?

472
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:42,375
I was the first person to arrest you
for theft from Gabriel Road.

473
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:45,583
-He was a pickpocket.
-Father.

474
00:46:45,666 --> 00:46:47,291
He and his partner, Bilal,

475
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:51,916
were petty thieves
and then they started smuggling goods.

476
00:46:52,416 --> 00:46:56,000
After the '93 blast,
Bilal fled to Pakistan, and he

477
00:46:57,166 --> 00:47:00,750
disguised himself
as a religious leader in Padgha.

478
00:47:01,416 --> 00:47:04,916
This has been his job ever since.
Misleading innocent children.

479
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,916
Relax, Mr. Khan.

480
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:08,833
What happened, Usmani?

481
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:11,875
An Indian Muslim's attitude scared you?

482
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,000
Usmani!

483
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:24,250
This country hates Kasab,

484
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,916
but respects Kalam.

485
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:29,916
The day I have proof against you,

486
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:32,375
I'll drag you out of Padgha.

487
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:35,125
<i>Allah hafiz</i>.

488
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:52,041
What happened today wasn't right, brother.

489
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:58,125
Sooryavanshi's insolent behavior
was unacceptable.

490
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:03,000
Father, Vivek is here from Shivgarh.

491
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:05,166
Call him.

492
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:09,458
I received a message for you last night.

493
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:12,375
Bilal is coming back to India.

494
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,250
Your good friend.

495
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:19,000
He will be in Goa on the 27th.

496
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:34,083
A man under the alias of Ajay Gupta
will be on the Maldives flight tomorrow.

497
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,958
Pick him up and bring him to us.

498
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,625
"Under the alias?"

499
00:48:40,708 --> 00:48:43,916
-So Ajay Gupta is not his real name?
-Just do as I say.

500
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:47,041
-You'll get five lakhs.
-Five lakhs?

501
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:51,500
-Is he close to Usmani?
-You don't need to know.

502
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:58,791
Why are we getting five lakhs
to receive this man?

503
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:01,041
Something's fishy.

504
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:05,166
What do we care, Lily?
We'll split the money and have fun.

505
00:49:14,333 --> 00:49:16,125
I am John Mascarenhas, sir.

506
00:49:18,416 --> 00:49:21,708
Sir, her… she is my partner, Lily.

507
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:25,500
When a woman is with you,
they are less suspicious.

508
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:26,583
Open up quick.

509
00:49:38,791 --> 00:49:40,291
I've got news for you, Riyaaz.

510
00:49:41,041 --> 00:49:44,416
Bilal has reached Goa.
Time for you to get out of here.

511
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,458
You've become old, Kader.

512
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,333
You too have become fat.

513
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:02,916
-How are you, Mukhtar?
-Brother.

514
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,583
-How are you?
-I'm well.

515
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:08,416
-<i>Adab</i>.
-Rafique, did you get married?

516
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:16,333
Where to now?

517
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:48,166
In 1993, one ton of RDX was brought in,

518
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,875
but only 400 kg. was used.

519
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:02,708
600 kg. is still buried somewhere.

520
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:16,500
It's been 27 years, brother.

521
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:19,250
Will it still work?

522
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:22,333
We're talking about RDX.
It's been used since World War II.

523
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:26,625
Even if kept in water for years,
it'll still work.

524
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,958
Anyway, you will see on Friday.

525
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:41,958
Hi. Is this your house?

526
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:45,666
-Yes.
-I live across the street.

527
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:48,583
The house was locked for a long time.

528
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:52,625
You've come after a long time, right?
Never seen you. What's your name?

529
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:57,583
My name is Aatmaram.

530
00:51:58,208 --> 00:52:00,041
-You'll live here now?
-Yes.

531
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:00,958
That's good.

532
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:03,625
Can I take a look in?

533
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:06,500
-Uh… we're remodeling. Come tomorrow.
-I mean…

534
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:08,625
-Just a little peek… brother?
-Tomorrow.

535
00:52:28,666 --> 00:52:31,583
Mukhtar, take the truck

536
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:34,166
and hide it at the location we decided.

537
00:52:37,625 --> 00:52:38,666
What is it, Bilal?

538
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:43,708
This house belonged to Sabina's aunt.

539
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:46,041
She spent her childhood here.

540
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:48,791
We even got married here.

541
00:52:50,708 --> 00:52:54,125
This is what happens.
Time takes away everything,

542
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:56,708
and leaves you with memories.

543
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:00,958
Here's your ticket.

544
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,916
Your flight to the Maldives
is at 6:00 pm tomorrow.

545
00:53:04,416 --> 00:53:07,541
John will drop you at the airport.
We will meet again…

546
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:11,958
on the other side.

547
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:15,833
-Kader, can I say something?
-Yes?

548
00:53:17,666 --> 00:53:20,916
I would like to pray at my mother's grave.

549
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:23,625
Are you crazy?

550
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,750
Even a day here is dangerous for you,

551
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:28,291
and you want to go to Mumbai?

552
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:31,583
You know what could happen.

553
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:36,958
It's been 27 years, Kader.
Just for a few hours.

554
00:53:37,041 --> 00:53:38,958
Omar wouldn't allow it either.

555
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:41,625
Do it for an old friend.

556
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:45,083
We all know I'll not survive after this.

557
00:53:46,375 --> 00:53:47,958
This is my last chance.

558
00:53:51,166 --> 00:53:52,000
Just once.

559
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:55,875
One day. Just one day.

560
00:53:58,166 --> 00:54:02,041
And if anyone recognizes you,

561
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,625
you know what to do.

562
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:22,083
-The city has changed.
-Visiting after a long time, sir?

563
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:25,791
It's my first visit since 1993.

564
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:00,666
-Abbas?
-Bilal Ahmed is in Mumbai.

565
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:04,916
-How do you know?
-Father recognized him. He's with me.

566
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:06,875
It is Bilal, sir.

567
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:11,208
He's at Marine Lines graveyard.
Right here.

568
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:14,416
Mr. Khan, are you sure he is Bilal Ahmed?

569
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:19,416
The grave he is praying at
belongs to his mother.

570
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:24,125
Ask Abbas to track him
and to keep in touch with me.

571
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:27,375
No matter what, Bilal should not escape.

572
00:55:38,208 --> 00:55:39,375
Yes, Soorya?

573
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:33,791
I want to check out.
Can I get the bill, please?

574
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,833
Mom, look. It's Uncle Vivaan.

575
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:45,833
Hi, Uncle Vivaan. Hi, Aunt Tara.

576
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:47,791
How come you're here?

577
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:49,500
What are you guys doing here?

578
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:51,791
We…

579
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:54,875
Do you guys know,
they both work with my father.

580
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:57,000
They are police officers.

581
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:21,291
There's my father.

582
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,500
Get the children out of here.

583
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:58,208
Two people guard the stairs.
Two at the entrance.

584
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:01,375
The other three come with me. Let's go.

585
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:09,083
Bilal, you don't have to do this.

586
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:14,041
And after that? Death by hanging?

587
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,166
I don't want such a disgraceful death.

588
00:59:18,958 --> 00:59:21,875
I don't want to be a spectacle
in this country again.

589
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:25,791
This is your country as well.

590
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:28,583
Have you forgotten?

591
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:33,125
No, this isn't my country.

592
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:36,666
Have you ever seen your house on fire?

593
00:59:39,166 --> 00:59:43,125
The house you grew up in?
Where your parents grew old?

594
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:46,500
I have.

595
00:59:49,166 --> 00:59:52,375
They burned my children,
wife, and father alive.

596
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:59,000
I still hear their cries after 27 years.

597
00:59:59,083 --> 01:00:01,041
What about the attacks you did?

598
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:04,291
What about them, Bilal?

599
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:07,875
I lost my parents in those attacks.

600
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:12,291
I could take revenge right now,

601
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:14,625
but that is in the past.

602
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:19,416
We need to forget it and move on.

603
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,541
I agree that what happened to you
was not right,

604
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:27,333
but you took
so many innocent lives as well.

605
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:29,666
What about the innocent people?

606
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:33,541
And people who took everything from me,
what did I ever do to them?

607
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:40,166
I want to see this country burn.

608
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:44,541
I want to see it suffer.
And God willing, it will happen.

609
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:51,041
If God was with you, our officer, Abbas,
wouldn't have spotted you praying to Him.

610
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:55,625
Not just Him.
If you think what you did was right,

611
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:58,666
your mother would have come with you.

612
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:01,458
She didn't.

613
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:05,625
Because she knew her son was wrong.

614
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,083
A large crowd came
to your mother's funeral.

615
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,583
It was not because she was your mother.

616
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:17,416
They came because she didn't support you.

617
01:01:29,916 --> 01:01:31,541
Now, you'll get another medal.

618
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,291
You finally found Bilal Ahmed
after 27 years.

619
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:40,958
Bilal, you are not thinking clearly.

620
01:01:41,708 --> 01:01:45,166
No. I wasn't thinking clearly before.

621
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:48,708
Now, I am.

622
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:51,708
Do me a favor.

623
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:55,791
Bury me…

624
01:01:57,916 --> 01:02:00,291
next to my mother's grave.

625
01:02:34,666 --> 01:02:38,625
Sometimes I wish
we had just one religion, one God.

626
01:02:39,791 --> 01:02:41,500
Maybe then we could have peace.

627
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:44,875
I don't think so.

628
01:02:46,041 --> 01:02:49,250
Humans would've found
another reason to fight.

629
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:55,375
We got a call
from Sawantwadi police station.

630
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:57,583
Someone has seen Bilal Ahmed there.

631
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:18,166
What are you saying, sir?
I am absolutely sure it was him.

632
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:20,125
I saw him on TV. Halal Ahmed.

633
01:03:20,208 --> 01:03:22,166
-Bilal Ahmed.
-Yes, sir. Him.

634
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:24,500
I think there were more people inside.

635
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:27,166
When I tried to get in the house,

636
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:28,833
he stopped me.

637
01:03:28,916 --> 01:03:32,875
-How many people were there?
-Three or four, sir.

638
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:36,458
When I was about to knock at the door,
I heard a name.

639
01:03:37,416 --> 01:03:39,916
-What was the name?
-I heard his name.

640
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,166
What was his name?

641
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:44,416
Name… One minute.

642
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:50,541
You must be thinking I am a fool
who can't even remember a name?

643
01:03:50,625 --> 01:03:53,541
I keep a finger on what's happening.

644
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:56,791
But I have this disease
where I keep forgetting names.

645
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,583
You want something for that?

646
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:07,666
No problem. Just try.

647
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:10,125
-I am trying, sir.
-Okay.

648
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:14,500
But it's horrible to have
this old person's disease so young.

649
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:16,041
It's not that bad.

650
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:17,541
It is, sir!

651
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:20,708
You are a police officer.

652
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:23,250
I'm sure he can remember
hundreds of names daily.

653
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:28,166
Sir, my family feels embarrassed
because of me.

654
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:29,791
Even these kids tease me.

655
01:04:29,875 --> 01:04:33,250
They keep asking me,
"Oh red scarf boy, what are our names."

656
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:35,875
Why retain their names? They aren't mine.

657
01:04:36,708 --> 01:04:37,791
Bhide.

658
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:38,958
-Yes, sir.
-Come here.

659
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:44,208
Tie him up to that tree.
He will remember the name. Go.

660
01:04:44,291 --> 01:04:45,375
-Come.
-Go away!

661
01:04:45,458 --> 01:04:46,666
Take him away.

662
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:47,875
Don't hit me. Okay?

663
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:54,958
Sorry, guys.
I just realized what a nuisance I am.

664
01:04:56,166 --> 01:05:00,583
I keep calling you guys by weird names.
Vivaan, Tambe, Abbas, Bhide…

665
01:05:00,666 --> 01:05:02,875
Disgusting. Shame on me.

666
01:05:02,958 --> 01:05:05,791
For the first time,
he got all our names right.

667
01:05:30,916 --> 01:05:32,125
Call Forensics.

668
01:05:56,708 --> 01:05:59,333
The traces of powder
we found inside is RDX.

669
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:05,333
Judging by the size of the pit,
it had around 600-800 kg. in it.

670
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,750
Bilal's martyrdom should not go to waste.

671
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:23,541
Yes, Father.

672
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:35,625
Promise me

673
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:39,875
that both of our sons
will come back home, safe and sound.

674
01:06:40,958 --> 01:06:42,000
Promise me.

675
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:55,375
Hey, get inside. Go now.

676
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:56,958
Hurry up.

677
01:07:02,916 --> 01:07:04,125
Get inside.

678
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:12,083
Hey! Don't stop here.
Don't park your bike here.

679
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:15,583
-What happened?
-He is parking a bike here.

680
01:07:15,666 --> 01:07:16,708
Ask him to leave.

681
01:07:17,791 --> 01:07:19,666
Can't you understand? Get lost!

682
01:07:52,583 --> 01:07:56,416
Sir, Forensics confirmed
they used RDX to blow up the wall.

683
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:12,250
We'll contact you when it's time.

684
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:16,625
{\an8}You will not contact us.

685
01:08:26,208 --> 01:08:29,500
{\an8}As per our intelligence,
there are 40 more people

686
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:33,500
living in India for the last few years
as Lashkar's sleeper cell.

687
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:42,166
{\an8}You only have one contact now.

688
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:44,500
Your Area Commander-in-Chief, Riyaaz.

689
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,000
They are trustworthy.

690
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:05,375
Total 600 kg.

691
01:10:17,375 --> 01:10:19,791
Bilal Ahmed's return after 27 years,

692
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:22,875
unearthing 600 kg. RDX,

693
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,916
use of the same RDX in Riyaaz's escape,

694
01:10:28,166 --> 01:10:30,875
I'm afraid
the Intelligence Bureau's theory is right.

695
01:10:32,791 --> 01:10:35,958
Lashkar's next target is Mumbai.

696
01:10:36,041 --> 01:10:40,000
Soorya, Lashkar doesn't fire guns.

697
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:47,875
The cities they have targeted
were brought to their knees overnight.

698
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:53,250
And I know, they have no compassion
for Mumbai right now.

699
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:58,541
Sir, Mumbai and its people
have suffered a lot.

700
01:11:00,625 --> 01:11:03,250
First, the 1993 serial bomb bast,

701
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:05,708
then the 2002 Ghatkopar bus blast,

702
01:11:05,791 --> 01:11:08,833
in 2006, train blast and then,

703
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:11,125
Taj 26/11.

704
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:14,583
Ten school kids came here,
carrying school bags

705
01:11:14,666 --> 01:11:18,583
and killed 17 police officers
and 170 civilians.

706
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:24,250
Soorya, I don't know
when and how they will come,

707
01:11:26,083 --> 01:11:29,375
but I know that they will come for sure.

708
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:30,916
Let them come.

709
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:35,625
This time, we will be ready.

710
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,541
I'm a dead man.

711
01:12:07,625 --> 01:12:08,958
Am I going to war?

712
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:12,500
Am I late, Syria?

713
01:12:15,125 --> 01:12:17,166
It's been half an hour
since the embassy closed.

714
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:29,125
I've got an appointment after four days
with great difficulty. Don't miss it.

715
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:31,125
I won't miss it. I'm sorry.

716
01:12:33,166 --> 01:12:36,875
-What are you doing?
-I've started a garage here.

717
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:41,333
Now I treat my patients
and fix their cars at a discounted price.

718
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:44,625
-I'll fix it.
-Do you know how to?

719
01:12:45,416 --> 01:12:46,250
Do you?

720
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:50,291
Sir, I know. My father was a car mechanic.

721
01:12:51,125 --> 01:12:52,958
-Shall I have a look?
-Go ahead.

722
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:55,541
Your father's soul will rest in peace.

723
01:12:56,916 --> 01:12:58,791
Sir, my father is alive.

724
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,458
Ma'am, please sit in the car.

725
01:13:10,666 --> 01:13:12,208
Sir, please sit inside.

726
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:21,583
Bombay brought tea for you.

727
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:24,625
His name is Tambe.

728
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:31,000
-How is Vandana?
-She is well, ma'am.

729
01:13:31,083 --> 01:13:34,833
-Come over someday?
-I will definitely come before I leave.

730
01:13:34,916 --> 01:13:36,750
Okay. Ma'am, do you remember?

731
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:39,833
It was your anniversary
and he gave you a surprise.

732
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:41,208
We were also there.

733
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:44,791
It was raining like this
that day as well. Ma'am?

734
01:13:58,291 --> 01:14:04,291
-Surprised I remembered our anniversary?
-I am surprised you remembered my name.

735
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:15,416
Why are they here?

736
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:24,791
Ria, I know you've made
a lot of compromises for me

737
01:14:24,875 --> 01:14:26,041
and for that…

738
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:33,875
Thanks to you,
for putting up with me all these years.

739
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:38,333
We've gotten old
putting up with each other.

740
01:14:38,416 --> 01:14:40,833
Old? Us?

741
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:49,041
It's going to rain. Let's go inside.

742
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:58,416
-What happened?
-As I said, you have become old.

743
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:27,958
<i>It started pitter-pattering</i>

744
01:15:33,416 --> 01:15:37,208
<i>It started pitter-pattering</i>

745
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:42,666
<i>This pitter-pattering ignited the passion</i>

746
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:47,333
<i>As the passion ignited</i>

747
01:15:47,416 --> 01:15:51,291
<i>The heart longed for you</i>

748
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:56,041
<i>As the heart longed</i>

749
01:15:56,125 --> 01:16:00,333
<i>I was tempted to seek you</i>

750
01:16:00,875 --> 01:16:04,791
<i>Now you tell me, my love</i>

751
01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:09,416
<i>What should I do?</i>

752
01:16:21,583 --> 01:16:25,583
<i>I drowned</i>

753
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:29,500
<i>Standing at the banks of the river</i>

754
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:35,083
<i>You struck my heart</i>

755
01:16:35,166 --> 01:16:39,166
<i>Just like lightning</i>

756
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:46,208
<i>The crazy winds too conspired against us</i>
<i>Now, what do I do?</i>

757
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:03,708
<i>It started pitter-pattering</i>

758
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:08,291
<i>This pitter-pattering ignited the passion</i>

759
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:13,041
<i>As the passion ignited</i>

760
01:17:13,583 --> 01:17:17,625
<i>The heart longed for you</i>

761
01:17:17,708 --> 01:17:22,166
<i>As the heart longed</i>

762
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:26,916
<i>I went crazy for you</i>

763
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,166
<i>I have no control over myself anymore</i>

764
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:34,958
<i>What should I do?</i>

765
01:17:52,583 --> 01:17:53,416
What is it?

766
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,708
I am searching for the Ria
who loved getting drenched.

767
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:04,916
That Ria has changed with time.

768
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:18,625
There'll be bombs
in seven parts of Mumbai.

769
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:46,333
Riyaaz,

770
01:18:46,916 --> 01:18:50,458
it's hard to take a car full of RDX
into the police headquarters.

771
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:53,583
We won't bomb the police headquarters.

772
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:56,083
We will go there ourselves.

773
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:02,458
Then we'll see
if Mumbai Police saves their city

774
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,333
or themselves.

775
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:18,125
This man fetched Bilal Ahmed from Goa.

776
01:19:18,916 --> 01:19:21,708
According to immigration,
he's in Bangkok now.

777
01:19:24,458 --> 01:19:27,083
Okay… you and Vivaan leave for Bangkok.

778
01:19:27,166 --> 01:19:28,958
Their agency will help you.

779
01:19:29,041 --> 01:19:30,708
-I'll talk to the CM.
-Okay.

780
01:19:47,666 --> 01:19:50,625
We have an arrest warrant
for your boyfriend.

781
01:19:50,708 --> 01:19:52,166
Tell the truth, where is he, Billy?

782
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:56,125
-I am Lily, not Billy.
-That's what I said.

783
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,708
-How do you know Don?
-It's John, not Don, sir.

784
01:20:01,583 --> 01:20:02,625
I'm not joking.

785
01:20:03,125 --> 01:20:04,416
-Yes.
-Where is he?

786
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,291
-Who, sir?
-Are you mocking me too?

787
01:20:08,916 --> 01:20:10,708
Where is John, your boyfriend?

788
01:20:10,791 --> 01:20:13,333
No idea.
I've come to Bangkok on a holiday.

789
01:20:13,416 --> 01:20:14,333
Don't lie.

790
01:20:15,666 --> 01:20:17,750
He is involved in a terrorist conspiracy.

791
01:20:18,791 --> 01:20:22,416
And he has received
five crore rupees to help Bilal Ahmed.

792
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,291
What? Five crores?

793
01:20:25,375 --> 01:20:26,333
Yes.

794
01:20:26,416 --> 01:20:29,333
That scoundrel told me five lakhs.

795
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:34,708
Sir, he is going to arrive in a moment.
You should arrest him.

796
01:20:34,791 --> 01:20:36,458
India's enemies are my enemies.

797
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:39,083
I'll help you. I'm India's daughter.

798
01:20:39,166 --> 01:20:40,375
Don't trick us.

799
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:43,291
Stick to being its daughter,
not its mother.

800
01:21:06,958 --> 01:21:09,541
Pick up. Not her. Pick him up.

801
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:17,041
Sir, make sure you skin this cheapskate.

802
01:25:17,125 --> 01:25:19,583
He is an ass. He is a dog.

803
01:25:19,666 --> 01:25:23,083
-Sir, you know, I am--
-Daughter of the country, yes.

804
01:25:26,625 --> 01:25:27,458
Speak.

805
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:31,250
My Lily loves me a lot.

806
01:25:31,333 --> 01:25:33,291
She must've begged for my life, right?

807
01:25:34,708 --> 01:25:36,458
Please don't hurt her. Let her go.

808
01:25:38,708 --> 01:25:39,791
Why are you laughing?

809
01:25:41,583 --> 01:25:44,875
You are such a tool. Carry on.

810
01:25:44,958 --> 01:25:47,500
Sir, I have a rental business in Goa.

811
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:50,916
Kader Usmani is my regular client.

812
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:54,000
One day, his right-hand man, Rafique,

813
01:25:54,083 --> 01:25:58,375
asked me to pick up someone named
Ajay Gupta and drop him in the hotel.

814
01:25:58,458 --> 01:25:59,916
So I agreed.

815
01:26:00,666 --> 01:26:04,250
But I swear I didn't know
that Ajay Gupta is Bilal Ahmed.

816
01:26:05,291 --> 01:26:08,875
Why didn't you tell me he's Bilal?
The police will target me.

817
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:11,333
Sending me to Bangkok was Usmani's idea.

818
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:13,625
So I'm sending you to Bangkok.

819
01:26:13,708 --> 01:26:17,291
There was another man, the fugitive.
What's his name? Riyaaz…

820
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:19,125
-Riyaaz Hafeez?
-Yes, him.

821
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:20,541
-Riyaaz Hafeez?
-Yes.

822
01:26:23,208 --> 01:26:25,083
Let's send him somewhere else.

823
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:26,625
Perhaps to Bilal.

824
01:26:26,708 --> 01:26:28,291
I was scared.

825
01:26:28,375 --> 01:26:30,833
I'll go to Bangkok. I was kidding.

826
01:26:30,916 --> 01:26:32,166
There was someone else.

827
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:34,708
I don't know his name, but he was tall.

828
01:26:34,791 --> 01:26:35,958
A seven-footer.

829
01:26:39,583 --> 01:26:42,833
He didn't have two fingers.
It was like this…

830
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:47,250
-Let's go.
-Okay.

831
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:49,750
Get a sketch of the man.

832
01:26:49,833 --> 01:26:51,750
Okay. Shall I inform Padgha police?

833
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:55,625
-No one in India is to know of his arrest.
-Okay, sir.

834
01:26:55,708 --> 01:26:58,583
If Usmani hears of this,
he'll flee the country.

835
01:26:58,666 --> 01:27:00,083
I'll arrest him myself.

836
01:27:32,083 --> 01:27:33,625
I told you, Usmani.

837
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:36,666
The day I find proof,

838
01:27:37,583 --> 01:27:39,916
I'll arrest you from your house.

839
01:27:40,708 --> 01:27:43,750
We have your little dog, John.

840
01:27:44,833 --> 01:27:47,625
He started blabbing out in two minutes.

841
01:27:47,708 --> 01:27:50,125
Sir, Rafique is nowhere to be found.

842
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:51,708
No problem, Abbas.

843
01:27:52,708 --> 01:27:55,458
We have the head, tails will follow.

844
01:27:57,708 --> 01:28:01,000
You should've looked around
before coming in.

845
01:28:01,708 --> 01:28:06,875
There are 500 people outside
for every one of your officers.

846
01:28:06,958 --> 01:28:08,916
I know you have many followers,

847
01:28:09,541 --> 01:28:15,125
but today we are not going to let
anyone of them follow you, Chaipani.

848
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:16,833
It's Usmani, sir.

849
01:28:16,916 --> 01:28:20,000
I know. Arrest this lunatic.

850
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,875
We won't let you take him.

851
01:28:43,375 --> 01:28:45,625
Don't cops have anything better to do?

852
01:28:45,708 --> 01:28:47,875
If you take him, there'll be blood.

853
01:29:02,541 --> 01:29:05,500
<i>Moulvi</i>, my name is Veer Sooryavanshi.

854
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:11,333
I have been serving in the police force
for the last 20 years

855
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:13,791
and I've made more than 400 arrests.

856
01:29:16,083 --> 01:29:19,125
Some are named John Fernandes,
some Harpal Singh,

857
01:29:19,208 --> 01:29:22,166
some are Shyam Sharma,
and some are Ismail Khan.

858
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:27,166
People look for religion in a name,
but the law is unbiased.

859
01:29:28,708 --> 01:29:31,875
It only makes a distinction
between right and wrong.

860
01:29:33,375 --> 01:29:38,750
And all the evidence points towards
the fact that Kader Usmani is… wrong.

861
01:29:42,083 --> 01:29:43,666
You may not know this,

862
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:47,583
but three kids
from around here were brainwashed

863
01:29:47,666 --> 01:29:50,916
to leave their home and country
to join ISIS.

864
01:29:53,416 --> 01:29:54,375
Not just that.

865
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,333
He helped Lashkar operative Riyaaz Hafeez
escape from jail.

866
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:03,416
And he helped Bilal Ahmed as well.

867
01:30:06,708 --> 01:30:07,916
Forgive me, <i>Moulvi…</i>

868
01:30:10,041 --> 01:30:13,666
but if you support him
even after knowing his crimes,

869
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:18,208
then the whole community will be blamed
because of Kader Usmani.

870
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:25,041
If we don't arrest him now,
then maybe 1993 will repeat itself

871
01:30:25,125 --> 01:30:26,875
and neither of us want that.

872
01:30:32,583 --> 01:30:33,541
And if we want,

873
01:30:35,291 --> 01:30:41,458
we can call the CRPF
and drag this man out of here by force

874
01:30:41,541 --> 01:30:43,541
and no one can stop us.

875
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:50,666
Please, <i>Moulvi…</i>

876
01:30:52,625 --> 01:30:53,625
support me

877
01:30:54,916 --> 01:30:56,750
and let the police do their job.

878
01:30:58,958 --> 01:31:03,416
An Indian is asking another Indian.

879
01:31:14,125 --> 01:31:15,041
Let them take him.

880
01:31:22,125 --> 01:31:24,750
Put this arrogant old man in the car.

881
01:31:54,583 --> 01:31:55,458
Look, Usmani.

882
01:31:57,166 --> 01:32:00,916
We have methods of making you talk.

883
01:32:01,708 --> 01:32:03,625
Before joining the police force,

884
01:32:04,416 --> 01:32:07,208
did you read the history
of the Maharashtra police?

885
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:10,833
If you had, you would know that

886
01:32:10,916 --> 01:32:14,125
Kader Usmani will not talk.

887
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:20,250
Hit me now.
You have a strong body. Hit me.

888
01:32:20,333 --> 01:32:21,625
Give me water.

889
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:28,666
He is not talking.

890
01:32:29,416 --> 01:32:31,875
-What's the use of being a bodybuild<i>er?</i>
-Shut up!

891
01:32:34,416 --> 01:32:39,625
People like Kader Usmani
will die before talking.

892
01:32:40,875 --> 01:32:43,083
There's one thing they can't bear.

893
01:32:45,125 --> 01:32:46,083
Insults.

894
01:32:46,166 --> 01:32:49,833
Sir, he will talk,
but we'll have to do something unofficial.

895
01:32:50,416 --> 01:32:52,208
-If you'll permit--
-Yeah, right.

896
01:32:52,875 --> 01:32:55,083
Like you haven't done anything
without my order.

897
01:32:57,416 --> 01:32:59,208
-You need something for that?
-No, sir.

898
01:33:02,166 --> 01:33:04,958
Where are you taking us? <i>Abbu</i>!

899
01:33:05,875 --> 01:33:07,125
Let go of me.

900
01:33:07,208 --> 01:33:08,625
-Hey!
-<i>Abbu</i>, what…

901
01:33:08,708 --> 01:33:10,291
Why did you bring them?

902
01:33:10,375 --> 01:33:13,583
-<i>Abbu</i>!
-Let them go. Hey, Sooryavanshi.

903
01:33:13,666 --> 01:33:16,583
-<i>Abbu</i>! Let me go.
-Hey!

904
01:33:17,333 --> 01:33:19,416
Now watch what we do to your women.

905
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:20,333
No!

906
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,125
-Stand there.
-Oh, okay.

907
01:33:40,375 --> 01:33:41,375
Is this erotica?

908
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:46,250
-Shout properly, Khatara.
-It's Tara, not Khatara.

909
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,625
-Yes, Dobara.
-Sir. It's Tara.

910
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:51,541
Shout again, Your Highness.

911
01:33:54,708 --> 01:34:00,250
Hey! Let the women go
or I'll kill you, Sooryavanshi.

912
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:03,958
You need an invite?

913
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:09,333
Father!

914
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:14,333
He is a Muslim, not a priest.
They call him <i>Abbu</i>.

915
01:34:18,958 --> 01:34:20,458
-Don't hit us.
-<i>Abbu!</i>

916
01:34:23,666 --> 01:34:24,958
Let them go.

917
01:34:29,083 --> 01:34:31,875
Let them go.

918
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:37,500
He is ready to talk.

919
01:34:38,833 --> 01:34:40,791
I'll tell you where Riyaaz is.

920
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:43,833
Riyaaz and Rafique
have a meeting this evening.

921
01:34:45,208 --> 01:34:47,041
But first, let the women go<i>.</i>

922
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,291
Let them go!

923
01:34:52,958 --> 01:34:55,041
I hope he's right and we get Riyaaz.

924
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:56,833
That area is crowded.

925
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:10,791
I knew you wouldn't come today either.
So I came to pick you up.

926
01:35:11,416 --> 01:35:16,041
Ria, can we go there some other day?
Something big is happening in the city.

927
01:35:16,125 --> 01:35:18,250
Worried about the city and the country!

928
01:35:18,333 --> 01:35:21,666
If you were
even a little concerned about your family,

929
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:23,166
we wouldn't be in this mess.

930
01:35:30,208 --> 01:35:32,625
I don't want to hear any more excuses.

931
01:35:35,458 --> 01:35:37,708
Soorya, go to the embassy with her.

932
01:35:39,375 --> 01:35:40,833
Vivaan will lead.

933
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:43,916
But sir you know--

934
01:36:14,375 --> 01:36:15,625
Get out.

935
01:36:59,708 --> 01:37:02,791
Rafique is here.
Riyaaz must be on his way.

936
01:37:20,791 --> 01:37:22,500
Can I have some warm water?

937
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,375
What are you doing?

938
01:37:59,041 --> 01:38:00,291
What's this nonsense?

939
01:38:03,125 --> 01:38:04,916
Rafique, what are you doing?

940
01:38:09,541 --> 01:38:10,708
Stop!

941
01:38:25,375 --> 01:38:26,666
What happened to Ashish?

942
01:38:27,458 --> 01:38:30,875
Nobody is telling me anything.
Why were you not with him?

943
01:38:31,625 --> 01:38:34,833
Why? This wouldn't have happened
if you were there.

944
01:38:36,083 --> 01:38:37,083
Tell me, sir.

945
01:38:49,958 --> 01:38:51,916
Sister.

946
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:56,333
Sister.

947
01:39:51,666 --> 01:39:55,625
Ashish gave his life
for his city, his country.

948
01:39:58,166 --> 01:39:59,625
I am proud of that.

949
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:08,291
But how can I forget
that he was a husband and a father…

950
01:40:10,333 --> 01:40:11,541
underneath that uniform.

951
01:40:15,916 --> 01:40:19,791
I may soldier through, but my kid…

952
01:40:22,125 --> 01:40:23,041
what about him?

953
01:40:26,291 --> 01:40:27,458
He is young

954
01:40:28,541 --> 01:40:29,708
and it is not easy

955
01:40:30,625 --> 01:40:32,041
to grow up without a father.

956
01:40:36,708 --> 01:40:43,416
But Aryan still has his father
and you still have your husband.

957
01:40:48,458 --> 01:40:49,875
There's a saying in Marathi.

958
01:40:51,958 --> 01:40:56,041
<i>"Kutumbh ya jeevanacha</i>
<i>sarvottam aashirvad."</i>

959
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:01,500
"Family is the best gift of life."

960
01:41:05,833 --> 01:41:08,041
But life is too short.

961
01:41:10,958 --> 01:41:14,500
By the time we understand the way,
the journey ends.

962
01:41:17,916 --> 01:41:23,000
That's why in this journey,
nothing else matters but your family.

963
01:41:24,166 --> 01:41:25,000
Nothing else.

964
01:41:30,708 --> 01:41:31,875
You are a doctor.

965
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:35,041
You save lives.

966
01:41:38,166 --> 01:41:42,291
These police officers… they do the same.

967
01:41:44,416 --> 01:41:45,833
Only their way is different.

968
01:41:51,375 --> 01:41:54,958
All I have are his memories for support.

969
01:41:58,333 --> 01:42:01,583
But you still have your family.

970
01:42:04,041 --> 01:42:05,708
Right in front of you.

971
01:42:13,208 --> 01:42:14,041
Ria…

972
01:42:16,208 --> 01:42:20,500
forget what happened
and put your family back together.

973
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,958
The sacrifice made by Usmani
and our people will not go to waste.

974
01:42:41,041 --> 01:42:47,166
Today, every person in Mumbai city
will feel the pain we've felt.

975
01:42:47,250 --> 01:42:50,958
We are those lucky few who are getting
an opportunity of martyrdom

976
01:42:52,625 --> 01:42:55,583
in this war after 13 years.

977
01:42:55,666 --> 01:43:00,041
Riyaaz, I'm sure Mumbai police
will come here looking for us.

978
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,083
You all should leave immediately.

979
01:43:05,625 --> 01:43:09,041
I will see you there
as soon as the last car is ready.

980
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:24,625
Vivek, what's going on?

981
01:43:31,958 --> 01:43:34,250
You're right, Vidya.

982
01:43:35,458 --> 01:43:36,750
I am Riyaaz Hafeez.

983
01:43:38,083 --> 01:43:39,166
But that

984
01:43:40,416 --> 01:43:43,666
is not Vivek Shastri. He's Mukhtar Ansari.

985
01:43:46,666 --> 01:43:50,916
We left our families
and our country 13 years ago

986
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,791
and have been living in India.

987
01:43:54,125 --> 01:43:56,083
This is a war, Vidya

988
01:43:57,541 --> 01:43:59,625
and innocents die during a war.

989
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:03,416
This isn't personal.

990
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,125
But keeping you alive

991
01:44:08,708 --> 01:44:14,708
might put our plans at risk.

992
01:44:19,375 --> 01:44:21,750
Forgive me if you can, Vidya.

993
01:45:40,083 --> 01:45:42,083
I don't want to give you any false hope.

994
01:45:44,166 --> 01:45:46,000
We might receive news by the evening

995
01:45:47,333 --> 01:45:50,125
that Riyaaz and Raza have become martyrs.

996
01:46:06,541 --> 01:46:09,500
We had no idea
that Father could do something like this.

997
01:46:10,916 --> 01:46:13,791
We always saw him helping others.

998
01:46:14,458 --> 01:46:17,666
We can't believe that he…

999
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:18,875
How…

1000
01:46:24,458 --> 01:46:29,291
Aayat, the love we have for our family
sometimes makes us blind to the truth.

1001
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:32,833
Usmani gave his life for the wrong cause.

1002
01:46:34,166 --> 01:46:35,750
But by helping the police,

1003
01:46:37,708 --> 01:46:40,000
you could save many lives.

1004
01:46:42,041 --> 01:46:44,916
-Yes, sir.
-I'll show you some photographs.

1005
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,208
Study them.

1006
01:46:46,291 --> 01:46:50,875
Let me know if you have seen anyone
meeting Usmani or visiting your house.

1007
01:46:50,958 --> 01:46:51,875
-Okay?
-Yes.

1008
01:47:01,083 --> 01:47:03,000
Him. He…

1009
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:05,458
-You know him?
-Yes.

1010
01:47:05,541 --> 01:47:06,791
He is Vivek Shastri.

1011
01:47:06,875 --> 01:47:09,541
-Vivek from Shivgarh is here.
-Call him in.

1012
01:47:09,625 --> 01:47:12,291
Hi, Vivek. You're visiting
after a long time?

1013
01:47:14,791 --> 01:47:16,208
He is Father's friend.

1014
01:47:19,875 --> 01:47:22,750
Sir, John identified him as well.

1015
01:47:22,833 --> 01:47:24,833
There was one more man. A seven-footer.

1016
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:29,333
Where does he live? What does he do?

1017
01:47:29,916 --> 01:47:33,291
He owns a repair shop
behind Gangapurwadi in Shivgarh.

1018
01:47:34,125 --> 01:47:35,833
Shall we go to Shivgarh, sir?

1019
01:47:38,666 --> 01:47:40,875
He will be gone
by the time we reach there.

1020
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:47,708
I know the perfect scoundrel for this job.

1021
01:48:07,875 --> 01:48:09,000
-Sir.
-Sir.

1022
01:48:15,125 --> 01:48:18,666
Whoever creates ruckus,
I teach them a lesson.

1023
01:48:22,458 --> 01:48:25,250
Oh, my old friends.

1024
01:48:26,166 --> 01:48:28,916
Where are you going?
We just got here. Tavde!

1025
01:48:29,625 --> 01:48:31,000
Time for your cardio.

1026
01:48:31,958 --> 01:48:33,666
You bloody…

1027
01:49:33,875 --> 01:49:36,333
You have made a big mistake.

1028
01:50:02,041 --> 01:50:03,833
You bloody undertaker!

1029
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:39,875
Mukhtar Ansari, you are under arrest.

1030
01:50:42,583 --> 01:50:44,833
-Yes, Ramba.
-It's Simmba, not Ramba.

1031
01:50:44,916 --> 01:50:47,416
That's what I said. Tell me.

1032
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:50,625
-The sleeper coach, Mukhtar, is arrested.
-Sleeper coach?

1033
01:50:51,583 --> 01:50:53,708
Sleeper cell agent, not a coach.

1034
01:50:53,791 --> 01:50:56,500
-Nonsense, Sidi Bamba.
-Simmba, not Sidi Bamba.

1035
01:50:56,583 --> 01:51:00,208
-Okay, tell me.
-Something big is happening, sir.

1036
01:51:00,958 --> 01:51:02,916
Riyaaz and his gang
were hiding in Shivgarh.

1037
01:51:04,041 --> 01:51:05,333
<i>They have gone now.</i>

1038
01:51:05,416 --> 01:51:10,208
They are planning something huge.
They equipped seven cars with bombs.

1039
01:51:10,958 --> 01:51:12,875
<i>Six cars are gone. One is here.</i>

1040
01:51:18,458 --> 01:51:19,291
Cherivole.

1041
01:51:19,375 --> 01:51:22,333
Cherivole? Oh, Chevrolet.

1042
01:51:22,875 --> 01:51:25,041
Simmba, don't speak English.

1043
01:51:25,125 --> 01:51:26,625
Just speak in Hindi.

1044
01:51:26,708 --> 01:51:28,750
How to reveal car models in Hindi?

1045
01:51:28,833 --> 01:51:30,833
Just speak in Hindi.

1046
01:51:30,916 --> 01:51:34,166
Okay, I'll tell you in Hindi.
Six cars have been dispatched,

1047
01:51:34,250 --> 01:51:37,666
one was a <i>Bicchu</i> (scorpion)
and the other was <i>Bhagyawan</i> (fortunate).

1048
01:51:39,750 --> 01:51:40,583
What?

1049
01:51:40,666 --> 01:51:44,333
Scorpio and Fortuner.
You didn't understand, right?

1050
01:51:44,416 --> 01:51:46,583
<i>Now listen carefully.</i>

1051
01:51:48,458 --> 01:51:53,166
They are planning to park those six cars
in six different places in Mumbai.

1052
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:54,166
We have the locations.

1053
01:51:54,875 --> 01:51:58,166
<i>Bombs will go off every five minutes.</i>

1054
01:51:58,250 --> 01:52:02,083
The first one will go off at 1:30 p<i>.</i>m.
We don't have much time.

1055
01:52:02,166 --> 01:52:05,916
Send me all the details immediately

1056
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,500
and bring Mukhtar to the ATS office.

1057
01:52:26,666 --> 01:52:29,541
-Are you here to pray?
-I'll be right back.

1058
01:52:31,333 --> 01:52:34,833
Bhalerao's right.
CST, Gateway of India, Dadar market,

1059
01:52:34,916 --> 01:52:37,166
Lower Parel, BKC,
Bandra station, Minar chowk.

1060
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:39,750
Cars are in position.
We have just one hour.

1061
01:52:58,041 --> 01:53:00,500
We've informed the bomb squad,
but knowing the traffic,

1062
01:53:00,583 --> 01:53:03,708
I doubt they can reach
these locations in under one hour.

1063
01:53:03,791 --> 01:53:06,541
Then to evacuate thousands from there,

1064
01:53:06,625 --> 01:53:09,458
and then diffusing the bombs,
is not going to happen.

1065
01:53:10,375 --> 01:53:14,125
The people of Mumbai
must not know about the situation there.

1066
01:53:14,666 --> 01:53:17,666
If they suspect
there is a live bomb around them…

1067
01:54:32,833 --> 01:54:35,125
NSG can't airlift the car at Minar Chowk.

1068
01:54:35,208 --> 01:54:38,708
-There's obstruction.
-Evacuate the area. I'm on my way.

1069
01:54:38,791 --> 01:54:42,458
But prayers are about to begin
in the mosque and in the temple.

1070
01:54:43,708 --> 01:54:45,750
Shut it. Krishna, start the bike.

1071
01:54:46,416 --> 01:54:47,375
Hurry.

1072
01:54:49,208 --> 01:54:50,125
Father!

1073
01:54:52,416 --> 01:54:54,666
I can't do this alone. Help me.

1074
01:55:51,208 --> 01:55:54,000
<i>Let go of the past</i>

1075
01:55:54,083 --> 01:55:56,708
<i>The past is history</i>

1076
01:55:56,791 --> 01:56:01,833
<i>We will together pen</i>
<i>A new future in this new era</i>

1077
01:56:04,916 --> 01:56:07,375
<i>Let go of the past</i>

1078
01:56:07,458 --> 01:56:09,958
<i>The past is history</i>

1079
01:56:10,041 --> 01:56:15,416
<i>We will together pen</i>
<i>A new future in this new era</i>

1080
01:56:19,708 --> 01:56:25,083
<i>We are Indians</i>

1081
01:56:25,166 --> 01:56:30,458
<i>We are Indians</i>

1082
01:56:41,166 --> 01:56:46,083
<i>We are the stars</i>
<i>That brighten up the world</i>

1083
01:56:46,750 --> 01:56:51,333
<i>We are all the same</i>
<i>Then why these differences?</i>

1084
01:56:52,041 --> 01:56:57,166
<i>Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian</i>
<i>They are just names</i>

1085
01:56:57,250 --> 01:57:04,250
<i>Names don't matter</i>
<i>When the color of our blood is the same</i>

1086
01:57:08,041 --> 01:57:09,125
<i>We are Indians…</i>

1087
01:57:09,208 --> 01:57:10,916
Move. Step aside.

1088
01:57:11,708 --> 01:57:13,583
Move aside.

1089
01:57:15,833 --> 01:57:17,708
<i>We are Indians</i>

1090
01:57:18,291 --> 01:57:19,541
Sir. That's the car.

1091
01:57:31,208 --> 01:57:33,083
Bomb squad won't reach here in time.

1092
01:57:33,791 --> 01:57:37,166
Move those cars. I'll drive this.
A lot of people here.

1093
01:57:37,250 --> 01:57:38,541
But--

1094
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:44,416
<i>We still have to build</i>
<i>Many more monuments like the Taj Mahal</i>

1095
01:57:45,166 --> 01:57:49,666
<i>We still have to adorn</i>
<i>Many more historical sites like Ajanta</i>

1096
01:57:55,791 --> 01:58:00,375
<i>We still have to change</i>
<i>The course of many rivers</i>

1097
01:58:01,250 --> 01:58:06,000
<i>We still have to break</i>
<i>Many mountains obstructing our path</i>

1098
01:58:06,916 --> 01:58:09,166
<i>We are the new generation</i>
<i>We have new desires</i>

1099
01:58:09,250 --> 01:58:11,750
<i>We have new youthful zeal</i>

1100
01:58:13,208 --> 01:58:18,041
<i>We are Indians</i>

1101
01:58:18,791 --> 01:58:23,458
<i>We are Indians</i>

1102
01:58:23,541 --> 01:58:29,291
<i>We are Indians</i>

1103
01:58:29,375 --> 01:58:34,333
<i>We are Indians</i>

1104
01:58:34,833 --> 01:58:39,458
<i>Today, we broke free of the old shackles</i>

1105
01:58:40,416 --> 01:58:44,500
<i>We won't look at the destination</i>
<i>We have already forsaken</i>

1106
01:58:50,791 --> 01:58:55,583
<i>The world has already reached the moon</i>

1107
01:58:56,083 --> 01:59:00,833
<i>We too have formed</i>
<i>A bond with the new world</i>

1108
01:59:01,375 --> 01:59:04,083
<i>We are the new generation</i>
<i>We have new desires</i>

1109
01:59:04,166 --> 01:59:06,416
<i>We have new youthful zeal</i>

1110
02:00:01,541 --> 02:00:06,416
<i>Indians, we are Indians</i>

1111
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:12,166
<i>We are Indians</i>

1112
02:00:12,250 --> 02:00:16,416
<i>Indians, we are Indians</i>

1113
02:00:17,250 --> 02:00:22,458
<i>We are Indians</i>

1114
02:00:47,250 --> 02:00:50,333
Here. I've brought the Eiffel Tower.

1115
02:01:22,875 --> 02:01:25,875
If you don't do as I say,

1116
02:01:25,958 --> 02:01:30,708
then with the press of this button,
in two minutes,

1117
02:01:31,833 --> 02:01:34,958
an explosion will wipe ATS
from the face of this earth.

1118
02:01:37,375 --> 02:01:41,708
And as far as we are concerned,
all of us are here to die anyway.

1119
02:01:42,708 --> 02:01:48,375
But you… should think about your wife.

1120
02:02:12,958 --> 02:02:14,208
In the whole world,

1121
02:02:15,458 --> 02:02:19,291
whenever we raise our voice against
the atrocities done towards us,

1122
02:02:19,375 --> 02:02:21,250
it's labeled as terrorism,

1123
02:02:21,333 --> 02:02:23,833
and those who raise their voices
are terrorists.

1124
02:02:26,708 --> 02:02:28,583
Nobody ever heard us

1125
02:02:29,166 --> 02:02:34,125
but now the whole world will listen
to the cries of these people

1126
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:36,208
and their families.

1127
02:02:38,291 --> 02:02:42,208
Indian army and police have killed

1128
02:02:42,291 --> 02:02:45,875
235 of my brothers from Lashkar.

1129
02:02:45,958 --> 02:02:47,500
275, not 235.

1130
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:52,541
There are 40 of you too. Just let Ria go

1131
02:02:52,625 --> 02:02:55,958
and then we will send you
to your dead brothers.

1132
02:02:56,041 --> 02:02:57,708
-Hey!
-No! Wait.

1133
02:02:58,708 --> 02:03:01,041
I'm talking to him. Concentrate on her.

1134
02:03:01,125 --> 02:03:02,041
Namaskar.

1135
02:03:03,416 --> 02:03:08,041
You put us in a fix.
We will talk later. Okay?

1136
02:03:08,125 --> 02:03:09,208
-Riyaaz--
-Lamba!

1137
02:03:09,291 --> 02:03:10,916
-Simmba.
-What are you doing?

1138
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,166
Let someone else talk for once, sir.

1139
02:03:15,458 --> 02:03:18,250
Riyaaz, I understand your feelings.

1140
02:03:18,333 --> 02:03:22,666
Just listen to me once. Your country

1141
02:03:22,750 --> 02:03:25,083
is mind-blowing. Beautiful.

1142
02:03:25,166 --> 02:03:30,375
But does anyone plan a family vacation
there? No, they don't. Do you know why?

1143
02:03:31,583 --> 02:03:34,791
How would you know?
You've been on a 13-year holiday here.

1144
02:03:34,875 --> 02:03:39,166
But I'll explain.
It's because of you. Lesson learned?

1145
02:03:39,250 --> 02:03:41,333
Terrorism is bad for tourism.

1146
02:03:41,958 --> 02:03:44,750
You should think about cricketers as well.

1147
02:03:44,833 --> 02:03:48,208
Like Wasim, Misbah, Shoaib…

1148
02:03:48,291 --> 02:03:53,791
Because of your jihad,
they are unable to play in the IPL.

1149
02:03:53,875 --> 02:03:57,291
What do we learn from this?
Terrorism is bad for income.

1150
02:03:57,916 --> 02:04:01,708
People don't like low income. I know that.

1151
02:04:01,791 --> 02:04:04,833
There are artists like Fawad Khan,

1152
02:04:04,916 --> 02:04:07,500
Ali Zafar, Atif Aslam…

1153
02:04:07,583 --> 02:04:10,875
Because of you,
they are unable to work now.

1154
02:04:11,708 --> 02:04:15,375
What do we learn from this?
Terrorism is bad for entertainment.

1155
02:04:17,333 --> 02:04:19,250
And if this continues,

1156
02:04:20,125 --> 02:04:22,625
then people are ready in this country,

1157
02:04:24,041 --> 02:04:25,458
but one day,

1158
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:30,791
people of Pakistan will also
come after you with stones and sticks.

1159
02:04:31,541 --> 02:04:35,666
You see, Riyaaz, no matter how much drama
you do in front of the camera,

1160
02:04:35,750 --> 02:04:41,208
the bullet that will kill you will have
"Made In India" engraved on it, in bold.

1161
02:04:42,833 --> 02:04:45,500
Who will kill me? You?

1162
02:04:55,083 --> 02:04:58,625
What? Everybody knows who is coming.

1163
02:04:58,708 --> 02:04:59,750
You don't know?

1164
02:05:37,875 --> 02:05:40,041
<i>A whirlpool rises in the heart</i>
<i>The body shivers</i>

1165
02:05:40,125 --> 02:05:44,208
<i>When the news comes that</i>

1166
02:05:44,291 --> 02:05:45,875
<i>Singham is coming!</i>

1167
02:05:47,250 --> 02:05:49,583
Here comes God… with a gun.

1168
02:07:23,250 --> 02:07:25,500
-It's been a while.
-It really has.

1169
02:07:25,583 --> 02:07:28,458
Done with your bromance?
She'll explode. Let's go.

1170
02:07:33,166 --> 02:07:35,541
You guys should leave.
All of you should get out of here.

1171
02:07:35,625 --> 02:07:37,333
We are not going anywhere.

1172
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:42,416
-How did you get caught?
-I was coming to meet you.

1173
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:44,166
To tell you that I'm not leaving.

1174
02:07:47,666 --> 02:07:48,791
You're not leaving?

1175
02:07:50,375 --> 02:07:52,250
You and Aryan will stay forever?

1176
02:07:52,333 --> 02:07:55,958
Remember, if the bomb explodes,
we are all going to die here.

1177
02:07:56,041 --> 02:07:59,125
True, but where was she going anyway?

1178
02:07:59,208 --> 02:08:01,666
Are you a travel agent?
Will you get her a ticket?

1179
02:08:02,375 --> 02:08:06,750
-Think about how to extricate her.
-Ask the experienced expert.

1180
02:08:07,541 --> 02:08:08,416
Raise your hands.

1181
02:08:09,583 --> 02:08:13,125
Don't worry. They are old and experienced.

1182
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:18,416
-Careful.
-Yes.

1183
02:08:20,416 --> 02:08:22,875
Hurry. There's no time
and lots of RDX here.

1184
02:08:22,958 --> 02:08:24,708
Shut up, man. Please.

1185
02:08:24,791 --> 02:08:27,041
You carry on. Go on.

1186
02:08:29,291 --> 02:08:32,250
-Lightly. With a feather touch.
-You do it.

1187
02:08:32,333 --> 02:08:33,916
Why don't you do it?

1188
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,541
-Go on.
-Did you unzip it?

1189
02:08:36,083 --> 02:08:37,208
Give me a minute.

1190
02:08:40,291 --> 02:08:42,166
Will it be done today?

1191
02:08:42,250 --> 02:08:44,875
Pass my gun.
Let me shoot this idiot first.

1192
02:08:44,958 --> 02:08:46,750
No. Keep your calm.

1193
02:08:53,166 --> 02:08:56,166
Hey, this is not a firecracker.
This is RDX.

1194
02:08:56,250 --> 02:08:59,291
If it explodes,
she will get plastered on the wall.

1195
02:09:01,583 --> 02:09:05,708
-I won't let you make this sacrifice.
-Get him a pacifier, will you?

1196
02:10:10,291 --> 02:10:11,125
Take her.

1197
02:10:16,666 --> 02:10:18,958
I went on my knees for you
and you're thanking him?

1198
02:10:19,041 --> 02:10:20,416
He's the one who saved me.

1199
02:10:23,375 --> 02:10:24,791
Take her away.

1200
02:10:24,875 --> 02:10:25,708
Go.

1201
02:10:27,791 --> 02:10:30,250
Why do you always enter
out of a rotating car?

1202
02:10:30,791 --> 02:10:32,833
Why do you always hang off a helicopter?

1203
02:10:32,916 --> 02:10:37,166
Yeah! Who's got a bigger… entry.
It doesn't matter. Let's go.

1204
02:11:43,708 --> 02:11:44,666
I am Bajirao.

1205
02:11:46,375 --> 02:11:49,208
-You're Bajirao too, right?
-I'm Bhalerao.

1206
02:11:49,291 --> 02:11:51,375
Who is this Sooryavanshi?

1207
02:11:51,458 --> 02:11:54,083
Oh, man. What the hell!

1208
02:11:54,666 --> 02:11:55,833
You should eat almonds.

1209
02:11:56,875 --> 02:11:58,791
I eat them every day. Look.

1210
02:12:44,250 --> 02:12:46,333
Commando, I'm out of ammo. Give me a gun.

1211
02:12:57,458 --> 02:12:58,791
Son of a…

1212
02:13:26,500 --> 02:13:28,708
Are you crazy? I could have shot you.

1213
02:13:29,291 --> 02:13:32,166
It's your lucky day.
I would have pulled the trigger.

1214
02:13:34,250 --> 02:13:36,208
No problem. My time will come.

1215
02:13:36,291 --> 02:13:37,458
Your time has come.

1216
02:15:17,750 --> 02:15:21,416
Father, we won't survive now.

1217
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:27,625
We regret that we couldn't win the war.

1218
02:15:29,541 --> 02:15:30,541
Promise us.

1219
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,458
That you will continue this war.

1220
02:15:35,166 --> 02:15:36,708
War will continue.

1221
02:15:37,916 --> 02:15:39,500
Your father promises you that.

1222
02:15:40,916 --> 02:15:42,541
The war will continue.

1223
02:15:59,625 --> 02:16:05,000
Omar Hafeez, don't assume
the story ends here. I am coming.

1224
02:16:05,083 --> 02:16:09,625
Do you even have the faintest idea
about where I am? And what I can do?

1225
02:16:09,708 --> 02:16:11,708
I know perfectly where you are.

1226
02:16:13,875 --> 02:16:17,083
You have been sending
your people here like a coward.

1227
02:16:20,041 --> 02:16:22,708
But Bajirao Singham will come there.

1228
02:16:23,291 --> 02:16:26,166
Conspicuously. Like a tiger.

1229
02:16:27,958 --> 02:16:29,500
I'll be waiting.

1230
02:16:30,666 --> 02:16:31,750
Make sure you come.

1231
02:16:39,250 --> 02:16:42,500
Do it, Singham. Shoot.

1232
02:16:43,333 --> 02:16:44,416
We are unarmed.

1233
02:16:45,666 --> 02:16:49,958
You can then go outside
and boast in front of the world

1234
02:16:51,041 --> 02:16:55,500
about how you fought bravely
and killed all three of us.

1235
02:16:58,208 --> 02:16:59,208
Come on, shoot.

1236
02:19:12,625 --> 02:19:13,958
Take them away.

1237
02:19:14,458 --> 02:19:17,041
We should write <i>"Jai Hind"</i>
on their foreheads

1238
02:19:17,125 --> 02:19:18,791
and send them to their father.

1239
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:21,875
Hey, wait!

1240
02:19:22,416 --> 02:19:26,375
You can't harm us in any way.

1241
02:19:27,333 --> 02:19:28,666
For 13 years,

1242
02:19:29,833 --> 02:19:31,583
we have been living in your country

1243
02:19:32,583 --> 02:19:35,041
and kept killing your people.

1244
02:19:49,333 --> 02:19:52,041
Now everyone is pissed.
Let's get this over with.

1245
02:20:32,333 --> 02:20:35,166
<i>I don't care a damn!</i>

1246
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:42,416
{\an8}<i>To hell with you!</i>

1247
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:44,625
{\an8}<i>The lightning strikes</i>

1248
02:20:59,541 --> 02:21:02,875
{\an8}<i>The party has just started</i>
<i>It will only get better</i>

1249
02:21:02,958 --> 02:21:06,375
{\an8}<i>Music is on, it will continue to play</i>

1250
02:21:06,458 --> 02:21:09,791
{\an8}<i>We are celebrating</i>
<i>We will continue to celebrate</i>

1251
02:21:09,875 --> 02:21:13,166
{\an8}<i>Come what may, nothing's gonna stop us</i>

1252
02:21:13,250 --> 02:21:16,625
{\an8}<i>I don't care a damn, to hell with you!</i>

1253
02:21:16,708 --> 02:21:20,083
{\an8}<i>I don't care a damn, to hell with you!</i>

1254
02:21:39,833 --> 02:21:40,708
{\an8}<i>Go for it</i>

1255
02:21:46,791 --> 02:21:47,625
{\an8}<i>Thief! Thief!</i>

1256
02:21:54,375 --> 02:21:57,750
{\an8}<i>We'll crush anyone</i>

1257
02:21:57,833 --> 02:22:00,750
{\an8}<i>Who messes with us</i>

1258
02:22:01,250 --> 02:22:04,583
{\an8}<i>We will stick around</i>

1259
02:22:04,666 --> 02:22:07,583
{\an8}<i>For anyone who joins us</i>

1260
02:22:08,125 --> 02:22:11,500
{\an8}<i>We stand firm, we will fight hard</i>

1261
02:22:11,583 --> 02:22:14,541
{\an8}<i>Whoever will challenge us</i>
<i>Will have to accept defeat at last</i>

1262
02:22:14,625 --> 02:22:18,375
{\an8}<i>We are brave soldiers</i>
<i>Nothing can scare us</i>

1263
02:22:18,458 --> 02:22:21,791
{\an8}<i>Come what may, nothing's gonna stop us</i>

1264
02:22:21,875 --> 02:22:25,250
{\an8}<i>I don't care a damn, it's time to party!</i>

1265
02:22:25,333 --> 02:22:28,583
{\an8}<i>I don't care a damn, it's time to party!</i>

1266
02:22:42,333 --> 02:22:43,875
{\an8}<i>Now I've lost it</i>

1267
02:22:43,958 --> 02:22:47,500
{\an8}<i>I don't care a damn, to hell with you!</i>

1268
02:22:47,583 --> 02:22:50,958
{\an8}<i>I don't care a damn, to hell with you!</i>

1269
02:22:51,041 --> 02:22:57,708
{\an8}<i>I don't care a damn, to hell with you!</i>
