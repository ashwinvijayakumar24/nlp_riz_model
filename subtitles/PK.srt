A signal coming, he visits one to take me a homeland.

Says this is good .. that good.

418
00:35:10,682 --> 00:35:12,475
Never mind everything else not so good

419
00:35:14,085 --> 00:35:15,529
Big eyes told them,

420
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,045
Like wonder what that means ...

421
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:20,330
"Your mother accident ... good / right ...." Qur'an like.

422
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:23,846
.. When someone angry tone sound more.

423
00:35:24,354 --> 00:35:27,576
"But ... but ... I come to teach"

424
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,115
Some thinking while continuing to paint word.

425
00:35:31,805 --> 00:35:34,019
"But ......"

426
00:35:35,082 --> 00:35:38,003
Pay attention to your feelings by preaching's young.

427
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,146
Then the point is that one can realize that.

428
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,296
Escape the chaos. I understand went to six hours.

429

It is learned completely බෝජ්පූරී're six hours. Nobody did not catch up.

430
00:35:51,017 --> 00:35:54,453
One girl, who gave her support.

431
00:35:54,684 --> 00:35:56,977
So I exchanged her to complete my move.

432
00:35:57,326 --> 00:35:59,342
You're going to have a brain like that one laughing.

433
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:01,746
Making a false kind of stuff you have cherished.

434
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,738
Like an USB cable .. if your hands?

435
00:36:05,031 --> 00:36:07,992
B transfer files to another computer is a computer ...?

436
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,928
And your clothes ..?

437
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:14,031
Like you are wearing a pair of your planet b ..

438
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:19,261
No no no .. .. Our world, our world who are not අඳින්නෙම clothes.

439
00:36:20,563 --> 00:36:23,507
As soon as I got homesick, came here ..

440
00:36:24,681 --> 00:36:27,396
Our world different from those of the skin, the skin here.

441
00:36:27,983 --> 00:36:32,871
Some of the other co-equal bright .. කළුම black look.

442
00:36:34,037 --> 00:36:36,696
Someone's skin color, cataracts another person a while.

443
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:41,323
He sticks the skin of her body .. someone hanging down.

444
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:45,949
Then one day I saw a car.

445
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:48,187
Dancing car.

446
00:36:54,765 --> 00:36:59,408
As I understood, that is capable of and we're here.

447
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:04,805
The difference here is all they are wearing something that fashion over her body.

448
00:37:13,714 --> 00:37:16,398
Then I realized how does the mix with here.

449
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:19,969
Oh, that is it, people are laughing.

450
00:37:26,157 --> 00:37:30,674
After that, I understood little, men women විලාසිතාවනුයි විලාසිතාවනුයි to change.

451
00:37:31,713 --> 00:37:34,507
One night .. one fashion style lunch.

452
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,038
One one hand playing style dining style ..

453
00:37:41,252 --> 00:37:44,307
One of my clothes catch, a picture.

454
00:37:57,659 --> 00:38:03,095
I went slowly realize, is that to live in this world to survive in the picture.

455
00:38:03,587 --> 00:38:06,309
This brings the picture will eat.

456
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,047
So I started to collect pictures of this old man.

457
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:26,936
What man ...

458
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:33,576
Why do I have these ..?

459
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:38,797
What this book to my store.

460
00:38:42,264 --> 00:38:45,954
B .. .... you have to take carrots.

461
00:38:47,446 --> 00:38:51,660
I realize that this picture is only one nation that is useful paper.

462
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,707
The other does not make the paper.

463
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:02,095
The need for clothes like the car was able to complete with dancing.

464
00:39:02,325 --> 00:39:05,412
He did the same to my bank, I had the same clothes were coming hard

465
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:09,689
Once it got kind of a strange uniform,

466
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,895
The suit, because that has no picture,

467
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:14,982
The food comes to their own kind.

468
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,950
Mr. take this.

469
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:23,140
I realized that if I find a remote control that other people in the world to learn the language.

470
00:39:23,624 --> 00:39:26,481
Language can not or do not work here any.

471
00:39:27,108 --> 00:39:31,735
Just like he could not say that even if Mr. style ..

472
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,097
I thought I was bad in his style that persists.

473
00:39:44,183 --> 00:39:46,620
So I tried again, as you put it.

474
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,633
Am I met ඉන්ඳැද්දී down the road.

475
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,268
Am right to confront someone put some Douchebag go away.

476
00:40:23,085 --> 00:40:24,784
If the mind is not as nice.

477
00:40:26,371 --> 00:40:28,133
Nothing has not responded.

478
00:40:29,268 --> 00:40:31,077
Deaf ears do not know.

479
00:40:31,926 --> 00:40:32,926
The catch ........

480
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:36,806
Hear. No answers.

481
00:40:38,766 --> 00:40:40,218
Firm's shot in the head like.

482
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,234
Memory lost.

483
00:40:42,813 --> 00:40:44,202
Memory gone.

484
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,064
Do you remember who hits you?

485
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:01,730
Remember අංකේ car?

486
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,380

00:45:55,574 --> 00:45:59,026
The boy jumps down to everyone ..

537
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,925
The boy had been a true visitor ..

538
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:19,361
The boy had been a true visitor ..

539
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:25,792
The boy had been a true visitor ..

540
00:46:35,914 --> 00:46:37,764
I can understand your pain, brother.

541
00:46:38,653 --> 00:46:40,486
But do not say openly hold hands.

542
00:46:41,422 --> 00:46:45,175
Although beautiful red floor, it can be life threatening.

543
00:46:49,579 --> 00:46:50,889
Brother, do not hurt you.

544
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,436
Go. We now.

545
00:47:05,285 --> 00:47:08,300
You're here, whose corpse someone else right hand grips,

546
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,839
No one else do not think you come here, come on ...

547
00:47:12,283 --> 00:47:13,545
It's a real place.

548
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:16,918
There are very nice. And pretty.

549
00:47:17,489 --> 00:47:20,758
Everyone was willing to take me home, take my hand.

550
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:24,496
I've got many girls had a decent peace of mind.

551
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,607
පුල්ගඩියා.

552
00:47:27,265 --> 00:47:28,980
පුල්ගඩියා, she did not take a honeymoon room.

553
00:48:18,361 --> 00:48:20,392
පුල්ගඩියා a patient was sitting.

554
00:48:20,765 --> 00:48:21,765
In the meantime, I ..

555
00:48:21,804 --> 00:48:23,272
Over six hours ...

556
00:48:23,597 --> 00:48:25,788
Took her to draw on in my body.

557
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:28,867
Progress of ... health ... X / J

558
00:48:29,066 --> 00:48:31,525
I took everything that had pulled her inside.

559
00:48:42,317 --> 00:48:43,761
The first path, useless Echo ..

560
00:48:45,396 --> 00:48:47,070
Were you in love before the start ...?

561
00:48:52,717 --> 00:48:53,717
Too.

562
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,226
Where are you ..?

563
00:49:01,143 --> 00:49:03,588
I came from very far away.

564
00:49:04,707 --> 00:49:07,818
You have not heard the name, I stay at.

565
00:49:08,087 --> 00:49:10,238
But if we talk about how we talk.

566
00:49:10,944 --> 00:49:12,508
Just what you have learned is ..

567
00:49:13,175 --> 00:49:15,738
I spoke to his sister.

568
00:49:15,762 --> 00:49:19,920

569

You're talking brother.

574
00:49:33,718 --> 00:49:35,258
I want to help your brother.

575
00:49:35,282 --> 00:49:37,797

Go with me now.

577
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,425
This memory has a direct connection to something.

578
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:45,449
The point is to tell the doctor's brother.

579
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:47,822
Boil the mixture .. pill cure.

580
00:49:47,846 --> 00:49:51,250
There is a very important job. Brother .. we'll go.

581
00:49:58,486 --> 00:50:01,510
Stop here. Stop here.

582
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:06,375

I want .. I Male to Male.

585
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,041
It's very worth it? - Very much.

586
00:50:15,295 --> 00:50:17,850
Listen brother.

587
00:50:18,413 --> 00:50:21,230
The thief is in our own interest. But the message must Male Delhi.

588
00:50:21,254 --> 00:50:24,396
Because it is so precious caught selling the chain neat.

589
00:50:25,705 --> 00:50:28,816
So I go there, brother. - Where?

590
00:50:30,347 --> 00:50:31,347
Delhi.

591
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:57,117
This one .. - .. why?

592
00:50:57,696 --> 00:50:59,236
My remote control has been stolen.

593
00:50:59,648 --> 00:51:03,871
Sven's b .. The two of their remote control to find the police who are b ..

594
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:06,696
It's not a TV remote control.

595
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,370
So of what? - I can not say that.

596
00:51:09,854 --> 00:51:12,774
But it was fenced fixed elevation hanging neck. And it's worth much more.

597
00:51:13,432 --> 00:51:15,901
Where did the theft .. - Neat as well.

598
00:51:17,052 --> 00:51:18,663
She ...? One of the neat stolen ..

599
00:51:18,925 --> 00:51:20,996

00:51:21,487 --> 00:51:23,956
But Delhi thief far. - So?

00:51:24,607 --> 00:51:26,622
So where can you find cheats, then?

602
00:51:26,757 --> 00:51:28,472
There are two million people in this city .. weird.

603
00:51:28,622 --> 00:51:31,043
Police are men. Not without gods.

604
00:51:35,114 --> 00:51:37,978
Only God can help you.

605
00:51:39,676 --> 00:51:43,327
God hold two legs. Him means the only people able to help you.

606
00:51:45,692 --> 00:51:48,469
Oh do know is how we know?

607
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:52,293
Oh know, here මකබෑවෙනවකෝ.

608
00:51:54,864 --> 00:51:57,364
Have faith in the Son of God.

609
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:01,315
Who is god? I can say to help.

610
00:52:01,648 --> 00:52:03,672
-Yes, He is asking questions and not recite ..

611
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:06,989
After what I saw, I was freaked out.

612
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,743
Those who know this world

613
00:52:09,768 --> 00:52:11,807
Who made them ...

614
00:52:12,275 --> 00:52:14,251
They themselves made them one place to be.

615
00:52:14,513 --> 00:52:16,544
At least there are street street to his house.

616
00:52:16,924 --> 00:52:19,614
Hundreds of thousands of people to their questions before he goes ..

617
00:52:19,638 --> 00:52:23,130
He took everyone's problems and a small amount of solution.

618
00:52:23,606 --> 00:52:26,638
He did not have this kind of a wonder of the world.

619
00:52:27,598 --> 00:52:31,257
I could not believe you. Just thought I tried two or three times.

620
00:52:34,575 --> 00:52:35,971
Let me know god.

621
00:52:36,455 --> 00:52:39,875
20 .. 50 .. This is what this .. and worthy to it .. 100 500 .. Then it

622
00:52:40,501 --> 00:52:43,795
What is the difference between the 20 to 50 drilling drilling?

623
00:52:44,017 --> 00:52:48,430
- The size of the difference is no difference .. else. - And the 20's work is so deceptive ..

624
00:52:50,676 --> 00:52:53,223
15 to Rs.

625
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:08,584
Lord, I am very hungry.

626
00:53:09,195 --> 00:53:10,806
Give me something to eat.

627
00:53:23,518 --> 00:53:25,375
I can not imagine anything happened.

628
00:53:25,501 --> 00:53:27,097
The program argued that god.

629
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:30,311
Now I can go to my home.

630
00:53:30,802 --> 00:53:32,501
I took a good remote.

631
00:53:33,024 --> 00:53:34,969
I brought it back දෙන්නකෝ. I want to go home.

632
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:51,601
Know, this is it down to God battery.

633
00:53:51,767 --> 00:53:53,244
It does not work then we went to a little work.

634
00:53:54,378 --> 00:53:57,569
What do you mean ..? - I mean, to put a new battery put කොතෙන්ටද ...?

635
00:53:57,593 --> 00:54:00,767
Do not put the battery call. - Then why this does not work ..?

636
00:54:01,203 --> 00:54:04,537
Where this kind of damage happened. - I'm not going to do it no harm happened to work.

637
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:08,401
You're the God created ..?

638
00:54:09,186 --> 00:54:10,234
Yes, from my hands.

639
00:54:11,273 --> 00:54:14,138
God did not create you did God create you?

640
00:54:14,503 --> 00:54:16,900
God created us all is that?

641
00:54:17,034 --> 00:54:19,154
His sculptures we make it.

642
00:54:19,844 --> 00:54:21,598
Why create his sculptures?

643
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:23,241
And we can offer to hold Him.

644
00:54:23,804 --> 00:54:25,495
Tell Him about our joys and sorrows.

645
00:54:26,066 --> 00:54:28,034
There have been installed communication device?

646
00:54:28,446 --> 00:54:30,558
How do we hear God say?

647
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:33,740
God does not need communication.

648
00:54:34,454 --> 00:54:35,811
Hear Him directly.

649
00:54:36,018 --> 00:54:38,692
If you hear directly what the sculpture?

650
00:54:39,286 --> 00:54:41,811
I do not understand what the man.

651
00:54:42,818 --> 00:54:44,540
Trying to end our business, huh?

652
00:54:45,571 --> 00:54:46,810
What is Your problem?

653
00:54:47,334 --> 00:54:50,849
Conductor steal my remote control. I ask God ..

654
00:54:51,396 --> 00:54:52,960
That's where I tell you.

655
00:54:53,237 --> 00:54:55,388
B .. not a good head? - What does that mean?

656
00:54:55,412 --> 00:54:58,592
Little to someone that you bear all know.

657
00:54:58,617 --> 00:55:01,339
Thief Leaves can do the little legs ..?

658
00:55:01,363 --> 00:55:04,593
Go inside temple. There was a big God.

659
00:55:04,878 --> 00:55:07,409
Catch his bare feet. Run very fast.

660

Everyone was waiting for their turn carrying swords and money.

663
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,407
To their work.

664
00:55:23,089 --> 00:55:25,542
Two hours later, there was my turn.

665
00:55:26,176 --> 00:55:27,566
Oh my god .. ..

666
00:55:29,073 --> 00:55:31,232

Hold on my remote control not yet received.

676
00:56:02,299 --> 00:56:06,418
How do huh? What money we paid, a mental hospital would go over, huh?

677
00:56:06,442 --> 00:56:09,132
The man was pulled down. So give me the bill mean.

Anyone wearing going.

You two will be wearing somebody else.

683
00:56:32,591 --> 00:56:34,440
The temples are you doing anyway.

No, put his charity box.

He'll say that your job? - He does not speak.

Where to hand. - I can not.

943

Where දෙන්නකෝ.

944
01:19:20,087 --> 01:19:23,095
Boy, I need help. I swallowed hard enough.

945

Ask 1,000 people who are hospitalized for drugs.

946
01:19:27,452 --> 01:19:28,626
Another Rs. 500 is not enough ...

If you can give 500 children, නෝනගේ my life ... - I'll. I'll.

You can not read anyone's mind.

956
01:19:58,264 --> 01:20:01,089
Do not you understand? A man took the money to fool you.

957
01:20:01,398 --> 01:20:04,374
There is no hospital in the nearby foothills. - I know.

958
01:20:04,929 --> 01:20:07,644
He and his wife take a meal to bring my five-star hotel.

959
01:20:07,786 --> 01:20:09,929
Today, his wife of 75 th birthday.

960
01:20:09,953 --> 01:20:12,818
Everyone 75 years and his wife were not at a five-star hotel.

961
01:20:12,991 --> 01:20:15,826
A little at least one month to collect their pension from that little figure is making.

962
01:20:16,016 --> 01:20:18,318
Wife to bring ice cream, it has to pay more than the thought homey.

963
01:20:18,516 --> 01:20:22,032
The money is going to come here to mate නානකාමරේට.

Wait, wait, hold on.

Dalrymple's what's inside our බලාවි cut.

975

So why did I do?

976
01:23:06,297 --> 01:23:09,416
On this one, I came from, everyone just took the money from me.

977
01:23:09,908 --> 01:23:11,082
None of the money was not given.

978
01:23:11,336 --> 01:23:14,447
You're the first one I put in the box for charity in 5000.

979
01:23:15,486 --> 01:23:18,264
I felt inside, and I can not believe you're someone important.

980
01:23:22,382 --> 01:23:24,049
I will find your remote control, PK

981
01:23:26,049 --> 01:23:27,049

Really .. it's your world, you hear everyone out of the way .. Which is?

989
01:24:36,426 --> 01:24:40,156
The same. - Then there all walks nude.

PK

01:24:54,008 --> 01:24:55,008
I did not sleep at night until lights.

996
01:24:56,277 --> 01:24:59,143
How do you get a remote control තාපසතුමන්ගෙන් was thinking about that.

01:25:06,054 --> 01:25:07,800

1000
01:25:07,825 --> 01:25:10,786
Husband, you get a wrong number, you say I'm from yesterday.

01:25:16,143 --> 01:25:17,730
Okay, so what did?

How did the surgery haemorrhage die?

1007
01:25:34,839 --> 01:25:37,522
That sad fact is. But that does not matter.

1008
01:25:37,681 --> 01:25:41,609
Let's write a death certificate, a heart that. Not on a family name to be ugly.

1009
01:25:42,308 --> 01:25:44,529
So come on, OK, take the body.

1010
01:25:44,632 --> 01:25:46,291
Oh .... - right there, then bye.

Fun ..? - PK I was joking?

1015
01:26:15,388 --> 01:26:18,721
I understood. I saw the whole game. They're kidding.

1016
01:26:19,077 --> 01:26:21,602
තාපසතුමන් hard and call God,

1017
01:26:21,626 --> 01:26:24,610
This kind of head still is, God would appear.

All of it going wrong number.

1019
01:26:28,133 --> 01:26:30,538
A person who answered the call Him kidding.

1020
01:26:30,973 --> 01:26:34,941
Or how God, my remote control Laminating with his broken Drums existence itself?

1021
01:26:36,663 --> 01:26:37,845
Looks to me ..

1022
01:26:38,726 --> 01:26:43,059
Those who speak of God in this world with the telecommunications network, mess up.

1023
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:45,257
Every call going the wrong number.

1024
01:26:46,097 --> 01:26:48,137
- What do you mean? - I always thought ..

1025
01:26:48,938 --> 01:26:51,668
Why do not fit into God's answer to our questions.

1026
01:26:52,414 --> 01:26:56,517
Mourning scroll down to come to my house to give it says.

1027
01:26:56,818 --> 01:26:58,850
Tell me. We are all children of God, right?

1028
01:26:59,358 --> 01:27:02,112
So what dad, tell their children ..

1029
01:27:02,357 --> 01:27:04,374
Scroll down everything will be fine if you give.

1030
01:27:05,175 --> 01:27:09,302
Have it your dad ever? Scroll down if you get my daughter to have a new outfit that she attends.

1031
01:27:10,817 --> 01:27:15,087
I do not always mommy milk.

1032
01:27:15,976 --> 01:27:20,380
The calls go to PK or lesser God

1033
01:27:21,085 --> 01:27:22,967
He is what process?

1034
01:27:23,109 --> 01:27:27,117
What is he? Say, every day millions of children are on the road in my sleep.

1035
01:27:27,363 --> 01:27:30,506
Let them drink milk. I am not from me mommy milk.

1036
01:27:30,982 --> 01:27:34,506
I'm sure someone who took us fun. Now that you like.

1037
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:37,760
PK guy I thought was important lifestyle.

1038
01:27:38,062 --> 01:27:39,950
I did not have this issue to untie his head.

1039
01:27:40,305 --> 01:27:43,115
What would be a good idea came to my head.

1040
01:27:43,361 --> 01:27:46,273
PK's remote control back to a better kind of idea.

1041
01:27:48,169 --> 01:27:51,630
Who is the PK? - Who? Where is home? It does not do anything.

1042
01:27:52,097 --> 01:27:54,463
But he can not see anyone as we see in this world.

1043
01:27:55,304 --> 01:27:56,526
What does that mean? - Means ..

1044
01:27:57,049 --> 01:28:01,105
You see, he smokes, police spoke to say, you're trying to දිවිනහගන්න

1045
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:04,843
What is it? - Pack has more hit one, that smoking is cancer.

1046
01:28:06,843 --> 01:28:08,009
What do you think?

1047
01:28:10,484 --> 01:28:11,484
War.

1048
01:28:12,301 --> 01:28:14,881
I would like to face the joys of PK with තාපසතුමන්.

1049
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:17,826
They want to talk about the other show on television.

1050
01:28:18,777 --> 01:28:20,864
Evaluation is looking more ඉන්ඳැද්දී values.

1051
01:28:21,832 --> 01:28:24,268
Clenching already back to my right side, there are three signs.

1052
01:28:25,085 --> 01:28:27,903
But it has brought you to the left, both sides are balanced, what?

1053
01:28:28,077 --> 01:28:32,355
No Jerry, what's most important in this war is not fought with PK තාපසතුමන්.

1054
01:28:32,657 --> 01:28:37,752
He will explain to him in love, he does not go to God's call that number is incorrect.

You're pretty scared. These are removed from it.

Not a question about religion.

1257

It's something to believe in.

1258
01:43:22,546 --> 01:43:24,950
God does not like people questioning ..

1259
01:43:25,322 --> 01:43:29,259
He argued that we do not allow you to ask why.

1260

He's saying, Christian, be. If you go to hell.

1287
01:45:05,433 --> 01:45:09,187
If Christian, God wants me, I became උපද්දවනවනේ Christian family.

1288
01:45:09,504 --> 01:45:12,218
Now why does not switch religion. Again, wrong number.

01:45:13,344 --> 01:45:14,845
Everybody who wants to go to school.

1290
01:45:15,193 --> 01:45:18,178
If schools are girls, I'll shoot.

1291
01:45:18,718 --> 01:45:20,622
Our God is so low one can be.

1292

1293

God is ..

1496
02:05:19,013 --> 02:05:20,131

Then he asked God a liar.

1506
02:05:43,347 --> 02:05:44,664
Tomorrow should say ..

02:05:45,291 --> 02:05:46,394
God has died.

1508
02:05:48,592 --> 02:05:50,164
Boy, what do you expect?

1509
02:05:50,973 --> 02:05:54,188
I do not have a world of God?

1510
02:05:56,076 --> 02:05:57,076

Understand people's feelings?

1512
02:06:01,185 --> 02:06:02,788
Some people do not eat bread.

1513
02:06:04,065 --> 02:06:05,700
Some head no roof.

1514
02:06:06,929 --> 02:06:09,270
People do not talk to a friend.

1515
02:06:10,190 --> 02:06:13,547
How many lives that day නහගන්නවාද you know?

1516
02:06:14,063 --> 02:06:17,951
Buds take off. Fan hanging die.

1517
02:06:18,823 --> 02:06:21,054
Why is that? Because if they do not hope to live.

1518
02:06:21,633 --> 02:06:23,625
God came forward ..

1519

The hard and tried to corrupt people say ..

1525
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:45,377
Instead, do what you tell them.

1526

Every day you read this the wrong number .. .. wrong number.

1527
02:06:50,662 --> 02:06:55,074
We tell everyone, you tell me what the correct number.

At one time, was ..

I could not find food to eat.

1531
02:07:14,375 --> 02:07:15,716
I was not home.

1532
02:07:16,794 --> 02:07:18,049

God ...

1536
02:07:31,561 --> 02:07:34,180
I always thought that would be good tomorrow.

1537
02:07:35,283 --> 02:07:36,830
What is the right way to point to God.

1538
02:07:39,646 --> 02:07:40,663

1539
02:07:41,972 --> 02:07:44,417
Faith in God that spending ..

02:07:53,328 --> 02:07:54,820
But I have one question.

1543

I want to believe in God, and how.

1544
02:08:02,532 --> 02:08:04,992
You say that God'm drilling.

1545
02:08:06,865 --> 02:08:07,968
I do not say ..

1546
02:08:09,721 --> 02:08:10,721
There are two ..

1547
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:14,340
One was the one who created us all.

1548
02:08:16,657 --> 02:08:19,450
The other one is the one made by you.

1549
02:08:21,561 --> 02:08:24,434
We do not know anything about the man made us all.

1550
02:08:25,132 --> 02:08:26,759
But you're the one who made ..

1551
02:08:27,211 --> 02:08:29,092
You seem entirely.

1552
02:08:30,163 --> 02:08:32,258
Pretend play act,

1553
02:08:32,901 --> 02:08:34,083
Giving false promises.

1554
02:08:34,885 --> 02:08:36,416
Rich ones soon meet you there.

1555
02:08:37,415 --> 02:08:38,851
Letting the poor people there.

1556
02:08:39,256 --> 02:08:40,478
When praised happy.

1557
02:08:41,176 --> 02:08:42,430
People are afraid to even word for word.

1558
02:08:44,533 --> 02:08:46,454
I have the right number is very simple.

1559
02:08:48,334 --> 02:08:51,128
We are all made in God count ..

1560
02:08:51,818 --> 02:08:53,001

02:08:54,683 --> 02:08:57,612
And you made that fake god ..

1562
02:08:58,905 --> 02:08:59,913

Boy, we know how to protect our God.

1566

You can protect God ..?

1567
02:09:14,283 --> 02:09:15,347
You ..?

1568
02:09:16,665 --> 02:09:18,418
The world is very small.

1569
02:09:19,005 --> 02:09:21,648
In the world there is a big difference in the universe.

1570
02:09:22,045 --> 02:09:26,433
You're a little world, a little safer, a little street, so sit ..

1571
02:09:27,123 --> 02:09:30,020
I made Him to protect the universe ..

Him you do not care.

1573
02:09:34,804 --> 02:09:36,717
Him can protect themselves.

1574
02:09:40,303 --> 02:09:44,541
Today, one of my friends died because he tried to make his දෙවියන්වආරක්ෂා ...

1575
02:09:46,485 --> 02:09:48,271
I was just left her the shoe.

1576
02:09:50,430 --> 02:09:52,398
Stop trying to defend God.

02:09:52,811 --> 02:09:53,945
Or in the world ..

1578
02:09:54,501 --> 02:09:56,342
People will not only save up shoes.

1579
02:09:56,453 --> 02:09:58,318
One Muslim bomb blast ..

1580
02:09:59,763 --> 02:10:01,024

And it is ..

1586
02:10:16,291 --> 02:10:18,855
The world's most dangerous, wrong number.

1587
02:10:19,299 --> 02:10:20,735
More than anything serious wrong number.

1588
02:10:21,013 --> 02:10:23,790
Most people would die. Apart from each other.

1589
02:10:24,242 --> 02:10:25,678
The wrong number, you ..

1590
02:10:25,948 --> 02:10:28,694

1591
02:10:29,980 --> 02:10:32,368
What hotline wrong? - සර්ෆරාස් to entice her ..

1592
02:10:32,860 --> 02:10:34,717
Who said that Muslims are hypocrites ..

02:10:34,876 --> 02:10:36,883
So .. he is deceived her.

1594
02:10:37,049 --> 02:10:39,097
It's not a lie.

02:10:39,122 --> 02:10:40,558
Hold on. What is this ..?

1596
02:10:40,582 --> 02:10:43,010

True?

1600
02:10:52,501 --> 02:10:54,295

You have to forgive me, my foot slipped feet to the beginning ..

1604

1740
02:21:11,270 --> 02:21:12,270
Know?

1741
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:14,413
I was ten year.

1742
02:21:15,048 --> 02:21:16,762
My first poem le'mon.

1743
02:21:18,397 --> 02:21:19,500
It is written for the father.

1744
02:21:21,770 --> 02:21:23,730
Everyone says I look like my mother.

1745
02:21:24,610 --> 02:21:27,087
Everyone is real.

1746
02:21:34,420 --> 02:21:36,390
Poetry that is ..

1747
02:21:36,666 --> 02:21:38,358
Ensuring sound a few big story.

1748
02:21:40,556 --> 02:21:42,548
You're so cute.

1749
02:21:44,158 --> 02:21:47,158
A friend is one of the more ..

1750
02:21:53,602 --> 02:21:55,610
සද්දයක්වත් raven ..

1751
02:21:56,125 --> 02:21:57,149
There was no traffic සද්දයක්වත් been recorded.

1752
02:21:58,387 --> 02:22:00,299
Every sound clip was just my voice.

1753
02:22:15,684 --> 02:22:16,684
It was found.

1754
02:22:22,525 --> 02:22:23,961
I was very දුවවව්වා.

1755
02:22:28,491 --> 02:22:30,928
PK has been recording what mom?

1756
02:22:32,872 --> 02:22:35,531
I mean, Kaputu noise, traffic congestion, noise and hear.

1757
02:22:48,053 --> 02:22:49,553
Earth seems sometimes ..

1758
02:22:50,434 --> 02:22:51,910
I listen to the piano.

1759
02:22:53,402 --> 02:22:57,084
From there, you waved his hand, said.

1760
02:22:57,813 --> 02:22:58,813
Fast ..

1761
02:23:01,113 --> 02:23:02,962
Cristina wave you hand ..

1762
02:23:04,049 --> 02:23:05,247
Get the time ..

1763
02:23:07,009 --> 02:23:08,429
Millicent has not on record my voice would not it?

1764
02:23:10,429 --> 02:23:11,913
Will see ...

1765
02:23:13,198 --> 02:23:14,198
B .. put him.

1766
02:23:14,857 --> 02:23:17,626
You say that rhyme, have it.

1767
02:23:18,570 --> 02:23:21,118
It is the only poem?

1768
02:23:24,466 --> 02:23:26,386
I love කරනවායැ ..

1769
02:23:27,322 --> 02:23:28,965
I totally devoted to waste thinking about you ..

1770
02:23:49,296 --> 02:23:51,205
He did not back any one time.

1771
02:23:52,657 --> 02:23:54,348
Sometimes a glitch in his tears හංඟගන්න.

1772
02:23:55,975 --> 02:23:57,118
He did something about position ..

1773
02:23:58,133 --> 02:23:59,173
It also teaches something ..

1774
02:24:01,244 --> 02:24:02,744
Learned to lie.

1775
02:24:04,132 --> 02:24:05,291
Was taught ..

1776
02:24:06,100 --> 02:24:07,791
Love is the word meaning.

1777
02:24:09,172 --> 02:24:11,664
"I would love to be able to go too."

1778
02:24:12,870 --> 02:24:15,918
The world as children come ..

1779
02:24:16,838 --> 02:24:17,862
She is naked here today.

1780
02:24:19,409 --> 02:24:21,457
Like a lot of kids asking questions ..

1781
02:24:22,933 --> 02:24:24,750
Also asked a lot of questions.

1782
02:24:27,329 --> 02:24:28,575
Then one day ..

1783
02:24:31,789 --> 02:24:32,789
Go away.

1784
02:24:35,741 --> 02:24:38,638
We want them very far ..

1785
02:24:41,662 --> 02:24:44,185
The way I was given a very nice gift.

1786
02:24:47,502 --> 02:24:48,621
සර්ෆරාස්.

1787
02:24:50,765 --> 02:24:51,765
And my father.

1788
02:24:55,892 --> 02:24:57,312
පීවත් is long ..

1789
02:24:58,137 --> 02:24:59,931
He's in every night and look at the star ..

1790
02:25:01,225 --> 02:25:02,248
Waved his hand.

1791
02:25:05,017 --> 02:25:06,040
Sure ..

1792
02:25:06,770 --> 02:25:08,008
It also makes.

1793
02:25:12,809 --> 02:25:13,904
I miss him.

1794
02:25:48,578 --> 02:25:52,872
After a year ...

1795
02:25:54,403 --> 02:25:58,475
We are brothers and sisters .. one hour disembark Earth.

1796
02:25:58,903 --> 02:26:02,712
Do not forget that I'm given. Have four points.

1797
02:26:03,116 --> 02:26:05,839
First, banned from walking naked on Earth.

1798
02:26:06,355 --> 02:26:08,648
They do u kiss මනං ..

1799
02:26:08,672 --> 02:26:11,656
Every one who is naked here හැංඟිලයි.

1800
02:26:11,798 --> 02:26:15,806
Trees that raise everything else is open.

1801
02:26:16,258 --> 02:26:19,774
Second, the big issue here is the language.

1802
02:26:20,021 --> 02:26:21,837
You would then ask කඩමණ්ඩියකදී,

1803
02:26:21,861 --> 02:26:23,646
I love chickens, fish .. I love you ..

1804
02:26:23,805 --> 02:26:27,249
Not much to say here, that means those animals.

1805
02:26:27,558 --> 02:26:32,138
It means that, today, the chickens eat, or one that will take fish.

1806
02:26:32,622 --> 02:26:37,225
They think about the difference between what we say and what research is.

1807
02:26:37,939 --> 02:26:41,209
Third, we need to collect clothes from the car down, quit walking and dancing.

1808
02:26:41,566 --> 02:26:44,748
You put everyone in their underwear kicked remote control.

1809
02:26:44,882 --> 02:26:48,613
Nobody steals failed to hit the nail.

1810
02:26:49,049 --> 02:26:52,081
Fourth, and most important point.

1811
02:26:52,596 --> 02:26:56,707
Needing to meet someone who can connect to God ගැහුනොත්,

1812
02:26:56,873 --> 02:27:01,207
Left side of the research, on the other side of the back, you can come back fast.

1813
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:16,490
Brothers go. Oh, do not worry.

1814
02:27:21,980 --> 02:27:23,686
What will keep ඔරව ඔරව huh?

1815
02:27:25,415 --> 02:27:27,733
I have a question. - What is?

1816
02:27:29,034 --> 02:27:30,153
When the time came before you,

1817
02:27:31,700 --> 02:27:33,335
Were you how to eat cheeks roads?

1818
02:27:41,563 --> 02:27:43,610
Why these?

1819
02:27:44,919 --> 02:27:46,720
Self. B .. safety? - Yup.

1820
02:27:47,323 --> 02:27:48,799
Go. - Go.

1821
02:27:48,823 --> 02:27:51,315
Where are you going? මෙහේටයි go.

1822
02:27:51,823 --> 02:30:51,315
