1
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:44,453
Hey you kids, how're you all?

2
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,469
No greetings raees?

00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,331
Who bring the more stuff today?

4
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,407
Put some chemical In It..

5
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:11,414
Gujrat Is the state of
free india where everyday Is dryday.

6
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,384
Means, buying selling liqour Is forbidden.

7
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:20,255
If you got busted selling liqour,
you're will be impriosoned for 10 years.

8
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,236
But abondonned Is the
begining of rebelness.

9
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:33,278
Still gujrat Is declared drystate,
but annually It's consuption Is 25 crore

10
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:39,212
It'd be impossible of raees
would not be born.

11
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,271
Take a bath

12
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:36,275
the biggest seashore Is here
In our gujrat.

13
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,318
Learn..

14
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:04,332
I don't like to hit,
but you make me do It.

15
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,332
Now learn.

16
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,380
Now go there.

17
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:27,222
Nothing to worry, his eye sight Is
weak, he needs the specs..

18
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:33,322
Is that necessary today? If you don't
give me specs I won't go to school

19
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:38,335
his eye sight Is weak but
brain Is strong..

20
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,331
I can't see the blackboard,.

21
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:49,476
How much money do you
need for specs, don't worry about It.

22
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,442
Give me some other time.

23
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:57,284
I don't want to give him
the indebt sight..

24
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,420
I'll order It In few days.

25
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:14,501
I'll give you signal when danger.

26
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,307
You spec theif..
Brother..

27
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:04,288
From where did you find
this frame without glass.?

28
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,385
It won't work.

29
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,490
You come tomorrow,
I'll buy you a specs..

30
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,404
But I don't have money...

32
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:53,227
Take this frame back.
And give It to gandhi...

33
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,439
It's looking good ..
Look there.

34
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,338
Gandhi Is smiling.

35
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:12,389
Look, they're heading
to dealers den..

36
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,353
Our business Is In danger..
Lets go.

37
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:48,293
Remove everything.
The bottles and all.

38
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,304
Hurry up, don't let go anyone.

39
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,366
Find the liqour..

40
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,449
You here?

41
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,325
Are you fond of whistling?

42
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,300
Why did you slapped?
Ask him.

43
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,298
It's my work stuff..
Work stuff or violence.?

44
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,508
You do bad works..

45
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:46,246
As you do police job,
I do scrap job..

46
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:51,445
Mind one thing, no business
Is small for us..

47
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,323
And no religion Is bigger
than business.

48
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,441
Is really no business Is small

49
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,281
and no religion Is bigger than work.

50
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,479
Till It not hurts someone.

51
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,491
What'll do with money?

52
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,303
We'll sell the liqour,
ilyas Is gone, do you want too?

53
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,474
Police nabs the people who

54
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,507

00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:35,290
It's 6 bottle..
I'll take 3 rupees for 1 bottle.

59
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,424
Are you asking for work or ransom,
don't call me battery.

00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,459

Never call me battery.

Do you understand now?

66
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,227
Run away..

67
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,311
Give him a job..

00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,338
Sit..down.

72
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:13,335
Take the money,

73
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,306
Let them go..

74
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,518

Blow It now..

79
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,408

Till when will we work
for gerag seth?

00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,461
Lets start our own business,
It's not our line..

83
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,462

85
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,281

Your mood Is not good.

You must have think that
from where will you buy goods?

96
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,300
How can I buy goods from
anyone else except you

00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:07,375
do you know, In our business,
you've to spend money like water.

98
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:14,383
Do you have enough money?
He must have It.

99
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:22,264
How much worth goods do you want?

100
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:34,307
I'll buy for 1 lac..

101
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,347
Give me cash and take the goods.

102
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,318

Or you'll get nothing.

Who will give It In fatehpur.

122
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,483
Not fatehpur,
but In bombay..are we going?

123
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,490
Do you have any other plan
for paying jayraj..

124
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,337
You take your shop there..

129
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:14,458
We'll do some business here..

130
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:19,353
It's eid, let us earn some money,
we'll pray for you.

131
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:23,425
If I sacrifice you with your

132
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:30,498
Hey battery, can't you hear?

133
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,369
Get outta here.

134
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:35,291
You messed with mosa bhai, If you find
danger, why didn't you give me signal

135
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:39,388
you didn't give me time.

136
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:44,300
It's my mistake okay,
he got unconcious In a slap

137
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,372
anger Is the talent of devil,
therefore anger Is forbidden.

138
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:00,508
Your boys started the fight.

139
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:13,226
Your goat has became biryani

140
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:19,369
goat Is the prey of lion
not the business.

141
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:26,242
No business Is small

142
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,438
and no religion Is bigger then work.

143
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:31,440
Mother says.

144
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,485
My lose Is big and time Is less for pay.

145
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:47,387
If you pray for me
so I'll leave now.

146
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,300
Come here.

147
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:59,500
Keep It...
for future.

148
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:09,352
Can I have a biryani for both.?

149
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,354
Everybody will celebrate eid,
and we'll do fasting.

150
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,423
Leave the jayraj,
think about mechenic.

151
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:30,464
What?
Do you see girl dancing on my head.

152
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:41,512
It's 1 lac worth biryani..
You have It too

153
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:01,363
my ace has 3 thousand rupees.

154
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,434
What do I do with It,
do I give It to jayraj or mechanic.

155
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:20,354
You've come till here,
the haji bro sent me for business.

156
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,222
Let him come.

157
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,312
Have to kill the moosa.

158
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,320
I don't have any mess with
moosa, and It's not our line.

159
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,254
If I'd like to shake tail taking order,
I'd never do my own business.

160
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,261
Take your money back.

161
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,470
Moosa sent this for you,

162
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,405
now you were saying to kill moosa,
and now saying I'm his man..

163
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:19,245
Who are you?
My name Is nawaab.

164
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:23,318
I'm moosa's sadiq..

165
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:32,394
He can give me In train.
But moosa measures first.

166
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:39,463
Don't take this money,
It's of your goats..

167
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:46,466
Brother likes your business saying.

168
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,449
And when brother likes someone,
so nobody dare to touch him

169
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,271
If we'd agree with your first deal so?

170
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,371
My left hand never misses the aim.

171
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,485
Jayraj seth asked for you,
your time Is over.

172
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:40,521
Tell your jayraj seth,

296
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:52,255
People occupied the land.

297
01:23:54,295 --> 01:23:57,264

Raees mistakely called me near him,
so I could hear his heart throbe.

302
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:20,296
From here to here.

01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:22,366
Nominated this 200 acre land.

304
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:25,369
You've did big investment.

305
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:29,502
The dream of building
housing colony.

306
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:34,476
It's the correct time
to start the construction.

307
01:27:37,385 --> 01:27:38,477
So start It now.

308
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:08,427
The news Is hot, tell this to
press before It gets cold.

309
01:30:09,537 --> 01:30:16,238
Raees thretened..
If

01:30:19,347 --> 01:30:21,406
you bombed them while sitting,
go now.

311
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:27,287
Now It will be war.

312
01:30:34,295 --> 01:30:36,286
Are you gone mad?
You're challenging In media.?

313
01:30:37,365 --> 01:30:38,423
I didn't talk to press.

314
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:42,325
Told you not to shout.

315
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:45,204
You sell your liqour..
I'm doing my politics.

316
01:35:04,298 --> 01:35:07,358
I told you not to go
through my area..

317
01:35:09,336 --> 01:35:11,201
The business gets damage.

318
01:35:17,445 --> 01:35:20,312
Now you understand?

319
01:35:22,283 --> 01:35:23,375
Who's the daring.

320
01:35:34,528 --> 01:35:37,258
Raees did what he challenged for.
Now what will you do?

321
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,265
Raees Is your friend,
parasha Is your enemy

police Is doing Is work.

323
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:51,337
Majmodar's transfer Is the
cause of your friendship with raees.

324
01:35:52,379 --> 01:35:54,404
Raees will be In jail
In next 24 hours.

325
01:35:57,318 --> 01:36:01,345
Why do I go to jal..

326

On the roof kids are flaying kites.

339
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:08,351
The whole sky Is covered
by the kites..

340
01:44:57,257 --> 01:44:58,349
Salaam..

341
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:01,454

Have you come to meet me
or raid on me?

343
01:45:05,499 --> 01:45:09,367
In our world,

344
01:45:11,471 --> 01:45:14,372
You're making colony
after selling the bottles,

345

You're the same what you

351
01:45:38,265 --> 01:45:39,323
Little change has occuried.

352
01:45:41,268 --> 01:45:43,259
Now you can't hear the
phone call of m.l.a

353
01:45:45,305 --> 01:45:46,363

361
01:48:49,456 --> 01:48:54,325
Neither anybody's langar will
stop nor our business.

Tell the truth to everyone.

01:51:41,428 --> 01:51:44,295
Or make them believe.

367
01:51:45,298 --> 01:51:46,322
That everything will be fine.

368
01:51:56,443 --> 01:51:58,308
Leave me alone.

369
01:55:05,498 --> 01:55:09,264

380
01:59:01,434 --> 01:59:03,402
My duty was to deliver the goods.

It's rdx.

390
01:59:53,419 --> 01:59:55,284
Moosa betrayed us.

391
01:59:56,355 --> 01:59:58,516
This time police will not nab but kill.

392
02:02:20,499 --> 02:02:23,400
You've to live alive to proove
that you're innocent.

393
02:02:26,305 --> 02:02:30,435
If you run away so they'll kill you

394
02:02:32,278 --> 02:02:34,337

run away..

395
02:02:35,514 --> 02:02:38,210
If I run away so police
will not let you rest.

396
02:05:07,299 --> 02:05:08,425
You betrayed with me.

397
02:05:10,436 --> 02:05:12,233
You said gold and bought the bomb.

398
02:05:13,305 --> 02:05:15,500
You did a big virtue,
you'll go to heaven.

399
02:05:20,546 --> 02:05:22,446
To killing innocents,
you can't get heaven.

400
02:05:25,451 --> 02:05:29,353

403
02:05:35,427 --> 02:05:37,190

If you're In doubt so shoot.

411
02:09:43,275 --> 02:09:44,299
It can be new trick of raees.

412
02:12:34,513 --> 02:12:39,416
When you knew what Is gonna
happen with you, so why you come back?

413
02:12:42,321 --> 02:12:44,414
If I'd not come,
so wll you leave my men.

414
02:12:48,493 --> 02:12:50,393
Has to come to save my people.

415
02:12:55,367 --> 02:13:01,203
Whatever you're going to do..
Why?

416
02:13:03,308 --> 02:13:07,506
What happened?
Don't you believe on system now?

417
02:13:09,514 --> 02:13:10,503
Or on yourself?

418
02:16:29,314 --> 02:16:31,373
If anyone call you father so?

419
02:16:38,390 --> 02:16:42,292
Here's every day will be eid.
Every night will be diwali

420
02:16:51,369 --> 02:16:55,305
while saving the alley,
burnt down the city

421
02:17:41,353 --> 02:17:43,412
I didn't know weather I was
right or wrong that day.

422
02:17:44,456 --> 02:17:49,223
But hence the question of
raees surrounds me..

423
02:17:50,495 --> 02:17:54,488
Can you live with the alas
of my blood whole life?
