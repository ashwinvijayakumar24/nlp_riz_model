26
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,475
This is the 3rd time you've lost your cap in <i>2</i> months, Salunkhe.

27
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:48,206
Considering your age, I don't feel like saying anything.

28
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,813
But how much more..
Will you get the department humiliated!

29
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,243
How much?

30
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:53,516
You may go.

31
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,779
Please go.

32
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:05,191
Sir...I've worked 18-20 hours a day.

33
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,130
Dedicatedly!

34
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,168
Without caring for pollution or rains.

35
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,432
And yet the senior calls me a disgrace to the department.

36
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,365
Sir, I would've definitely caught them.

37
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,772
...If this had happened few years ago.

38
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,570
But now...

39
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,144
I suffer from B.P., High Sugar.

40
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:31,749
Sir, those boys are taking the police for granted.

41
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,323
Hey, this is a one way. Stop.

42
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,562
There goes your cap.
- Why you..

43
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:42,725
Hey, stop.

44
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,332
Every time it felt like..

45
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:51,105
“They pilfered the department's honor..

46
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,018
Look, he's standing there again.

47
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,356
Got it.

48
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,586
Singham Sir!

49
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,082
I'm as old as your father.

50
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,090
Shell out your driving license.

51
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,585
Home addresses, father's name...
everything.

52
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,619
You are all in trouble now.

53
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,696
Phadnis, Jadhav, note down their details.

54
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,256
Okay sir.
- Come on.

55
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,233
I told you we'll land in trouble.

56
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,129
All of them are students.

57
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,500
Don't panic.

58
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:57,474
You see those officers who pretend to be strict.

59
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,135
..are just as corrupt on the inside...

60
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,439
I will manage.
- Okay.

61
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,002
Excuse me, sir.

62
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:05,608
We are kids.

63
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,447
After all, kids make mistakes.

64
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,510
We won't do it next time.

65
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:11,754
How about we end this matter..

66
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,389
..with a little give and take.

67
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,574
I don't take, I just give..

68
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:34,034
You're still kids...

69
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,410
...and are already breaking the law.

70
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,176
Tried to bribe a police officer.

71
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,760
Sir, I'll arrest them right now.

72
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:40,673
- Let it be, Daya.

73
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,448
They are just students.

74
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,290
A criminal record can ruin their lives.

75
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:53,757
Why do you do this?

76
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:55,561
Too hot-blooded?

77
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,703
So why not use this hot-blood in the right way?

78
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:02,566
Just like we do our duty, you have some duties as well.

79
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,032
You can create all the uproar you like.

80
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,568
But not on speeding bikes.

81
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,039
Instead, on the path to building your future.

82
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,443
I'm letting you off.

83
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:19,646
Because the country needs you, not the jail.

84
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:26,393
Bajirao Singham has only changed city.

85
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,700
But his style of working is still the same.

86
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,662
"The head tremors, body shivers.."

87
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,728
"..when you know he's coming."

88
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,406
"Singham."

89
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,639
"No hesitation. No deviation."

90
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:42,736
"Just destruction."

91
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,176
"When he's coming.
- Singham."

92
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:00,020
Guruji, what's the 'Bhartiya Lok Party's' Manifesto..

93
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,589
..for this election?

94
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,996
If we manage to form a major government in the Centre.

95
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,363
..then our main agendas will be..

96
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:10,739
..Development, Safety of Women, SIT against Black Money.

97
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,999
And Youth Empowerment.

98
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,044
And so our party has decided..

99
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,581
..to encourage the young generation.

100
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,281
Guruji, your party has given a ticket..

101
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,718
..to TV actress Neeta Parmar as well.

102
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,422
Neeta is a daily soap actress.

103
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,550
..do you think she can run the government?

104
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,594
Neeta is not like the other social activists.

105
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,356
..who debates on television.

106
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:32,522
She's the new generation.

107
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,996
..who fends for women's right.

108
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,159
...from the police station to the court room!

109
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,694
It's disgraceful that in many parts of our country“

110
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,137
...the very farmer that feeds us..

111
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,202
..is forced to commit suicide.

112
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:47,277
But instead of lecturing on the poor conditions of the farmer..

113
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,506
..our second candidate, Kishore Kamat, lived amongst these farmers..

114
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,551
..and worked towards their development.

115
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:57,384
And proved that it's not difficult job to save the farmers.

116
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:00,015
Our third candidate, Sunil Prabhat.

117
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,125
Ex-Army Officer.

118
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,724
During his service in the Indian Army, Captain Prabhat..

119
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,590
...has set many examples of bravery.

120
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,223
Due to a bullet injury to his head..

121
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,998
...he had to take voluntary retirement from the Army.

122
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,403
But his fight still continues.

123
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,498
Against corruption.

124
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:21,202
We've heard that your party has chosen an NRI candidate as well.

125
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,178
How can he know anything about the country“

126
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,112
..when he never lived here?

127
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:30,050
Engineer Mayank Anand quit his job at the NASA..

128
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,215
...because he wanted to do something for his country.

129
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,120
Now, due to the Solar Energy Projects designed by him..

130
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,755
..many backward villages have water and electricity.

131
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:43,524
If the spirited youth and veterans work together..

132
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,126
..then nothing is impossible.

133
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:49,105
Every third citizen of India is a youth aged between 20-30

134
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,773
And this youth is successfully working..

135
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,341
..in every sector except for politics.

136
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,179
Political parties either choose wealthy people..

137
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:59,115
..as candidates or their own family members.

138
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,948
Guruji, if your party comes to power this time..

139
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,614
..then what will be your Prime Minister's first duty?

140
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,020
We'll talk.

141
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,425
To the people...about their problems.

142
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,093
Development.

143
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,692
Law and Order.

144
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,327
Woman Safety.

145
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,396
Inflation and many other issues..

146
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:19,027
...which we'll ponder upon and take necessary action.

147
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:22,468
But our main agenda is black money.

148
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:25,701
There's more than 315 trillion rupees..

149
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,410
..of Black Money in India.

150
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,606
And due to this the rich are getting richer..

151
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,013
..and the poor are getting poorer.

152
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,676
This black money is extensively used..

153
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,278
“By political parties to buy vote banks during elections

154
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,754
..so that they can attain power.

155
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,720
And everything continues the way it has.

156
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,551
But we have to change it!

157
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:50,630
Sorry...l got carried away, but this is the truth.

158
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,435
Any other question please?

159
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,332
You don't need to remember anything.

160
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,171
..when speaking the truth.

161
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,471
Ask to CM.
- Sir, one question.

162
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:00,670
Make it fast.

163
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,445
What are you doing, Singham?

164
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:10,648
The Press will think you're doing all this for a promotion.

165
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,115
Let it be.

166
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,621
I admit I am the CM.

167
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:20,324
But together we were Guruji's student in the same school.

168
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,530
Yes, but even back then you were my senior.

169
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,430
And you still are.

170
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:29,099
Adhikari, a person's deeds makes him big, not his age.

171
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,339
When he was a kid, he bribed the school peon..

172
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:36,206
..and leaked the exam papers, and today..

173
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,139
What are you doing, sir?

174
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:37,671
I am the CM.

175
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,048
Don't embarrass me.
- Fine, fine.

176
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,210
Sir, I needed to talk to you.

177
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,412
Yes, yes...

178
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,721
Sir, according to lB's report, your life's in danger.

179
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,692
So we're increasing your security.

180
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,421
Let it be, Singham.

181
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:54,657
These days everyone in politics is insecure.

182
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,134
That's why they need security.

183
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,902
Who will kill me?

184
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,069
Me!

185
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:06,066
The word 'Me' has ruined the entire human race.

186
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,007
'Me'...

187
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,514
'I did this'...

188
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,184
'It's me'.

189
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,343
'I. . .Me. . .Nlyself.'

190
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,584
Be selfless, not selfish.

191
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:25,392
Have you ever seen the river drink its water?

192
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,591
Or the tree eating its fruit?

193
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,162
Have you ever seen the sun taking a sun-bath?

194
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,665
No!

195
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:41,605
Those who forsake their safe haven..

196
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:46,475
..and sheds light on others.

197
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,110
...rise above 'Me' and 'l' forever.

198
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,654
Glory to Baba!

199
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,314
Glory to Baba!

200
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,085
Glory to Baba!

201
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,125
<i>Babe .</i>

202
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,357
Baba, I am Shirke.

203
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,624
From Ratnagiri.

204
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,393
This is my wife.

205
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,294
We've been married for 10 years.

206
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,435
But my wife hasn't borne a child yet

207
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,370
Send your wife to me!

208
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,273
I mean...come here, sister.

209
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,574
Your favorite fruit is mango, right?

210
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,210
Yes.

211
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:26,086
Stan eating mangoes...

212
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:29,592
Soon you'll want to eat raw mangoes.

213
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:30,684
Hail!

214
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,320
Glory to Baba!

215
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,796
Glory to Baba!

216
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,396
Glory to Baba!

217
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,763
Glory to Baba!

218
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,468
So be it!
- Glory to Baba!

219
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:43,034
Baba, I am Jenny Carlton. From Rome.

220
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,337
I am going through a lot of stress.

221
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,810
No job satisfaction, broken marriage.

222
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,437
Show me the right path, Baba

223
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,309
My Jenny from Rome.

224
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:59,385
Keep the chanting the chant of Om!

225
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:04,661
And forsake this fair body, the devious heart.

226
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:08,188
..and the sinful money.

227
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,067
Sacrifice!

228
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,543
What's this... tucked under your shoulders!

229
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:15,596
These wallets, purses...

230
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,768
The longer you try to hold sand in your hands..

231
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,203
..faster it will slip through.

232
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,177
So take the name of God in my court.

233
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:28,117
..and open up your pockets and your heads

234
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,279
And empty them.

235
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:34,189
Because...those whose heads are free of deceit.

236
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:38,127
..is where the Lord dwells.

237
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,596
Glory to Baba!

238
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,653
Rise.

239
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:43,427
Rise, empty your pockets.

240
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,368
You too.

241
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,302
Sister...get up.

242
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,429
Look at how empty you're feeling.

243
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,304
You feel like flying.

244
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,401
You want to run.

245
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,242
You've all turned into children.

246
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,575
Children of God.

247
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,373
We're children, aren't we?
Aren't we?

248
00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,348
Empty your selves.

249
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:00,680
Children don't keep money.

250
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:18,733
Your court seemed more like a bank.

251
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,631
And it looked like you were officially pilfering your own bank.

252
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,438
Prakash Rao, you can't become a Baba..

253
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,577
..even after you do BA twice.

254
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,044
Because I've crucial information.

255
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,049
..about the common man.

256
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,347
"My favorite fruit is mango."

257
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,183
Everyone's favorite fruit is mango.

258
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,020
The difficulties of a common man give rise to fear.

259
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,124
And fear gives rise to blind faith.

260
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,795
And blind faith gives rise to 'Me'.

261
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:50,191
Yes Baba, but there's an old man who isn't scared.

262
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:52,435
Guruji, right?

263
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,503
Bhola!

264
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,475
Where were you running off to?

265
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,337
The police?

266
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,144
Yes, I was going to the police.

267
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,181
You cheated us.

268
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,187
I was your devotee.

269
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,689
I revered you like God.

270
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,526
But you turned out to be a devil.

271
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,651
I see.

272
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,057
What did you find out about me?

273
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,154
Come on, say it.

274
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,028
Tell me, tell me.

275
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,692
What were you going to tell the police?

276
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,534
Say it..

277
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,227
Tell me..
- I..

278
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,271
Speak up!

279
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,271
Speak up!

280
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,329
Speak up!

281
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,103
The donations made to Prakash Rads party“.

282
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,140
..for administrative jobs, are deposited in your trust.

283
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,710
And Altaf takes that money to his factory.

284
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,213
So that they can be used during elections for acquiring vote bank.

285
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,623
Altaf, he knows about you too.

286
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,493
You're omniscient.

287
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,392
Speak up, go ahead.

288
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:55,399
And I know that you've raped three girls.

289
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,535
And there's no trace of all three girls.

290
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,036
And you know, now..

291
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,974
What?
- How dare you!

292
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,046
Rao, where were we?

293
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,445
Rao.

294
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,352
Yes.
- Where were you?

295
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,351
Guruji...is introducing.

296
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:24,327
..young inexperienced people in politics.

297
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,395
You mean we haven't reaped our share yet..

298
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,166
..and the others are already asking for their share.

299
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:34,000
I guess we'll have to teach Guruji..

300
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,498
..that youth looks better in the army..

301
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,337
..and old men, in heaven!

302
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,311
By 10th next month..

303
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,681
All the preparations for the Urs will be made.

304
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:49,678
OK8V~

305
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,018
Daya, take care of the arrangements.

306
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,025
No, no. we're not worried about the arrangements.

307
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,591
And anyway, the Mumbai Police..

308
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,493
..offer the first prayer every year at this tomb.

309
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,725
Your presence is enough for us.

310
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:04,696
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

311
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:09,631
Kishore, you?

312
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,669
Daya said this is where I'll find you.

313
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,233
And it was really important to see you.

314
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:14,334
Why?

315
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,040
Mom and dad have called 70 times in the last 7 days.

316
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,204
The same question.

317
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,581
Kishore, when are you introducing your sister to Singham?

318
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,415
What.
- What?

319
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,085
I want you two to decide..

320
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,451
..whether you want to get married or not.

321
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,581
And leave me alone.

322
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,387
Fine, I'll meet her some day.

323
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,687
Not someday, today!

324
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,459
I've called Avni here.

325
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,002
You two discuss this together..

326
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,437
...I've to head for a party meeting.

327
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,069
You and your politics.

328
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,400
What about it?

329
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:51,112
Brother doesn't know, Politics is like a bus.

330
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,347
Whether he climbs on the bus..

331
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,475
..or the bus runs over him..

332
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,210
..he's the one who'll get squashed.

333
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,680
Are you done?

334
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,743
Can I go for my meeting?

335
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,217
And yes, I need an answer by evening.

336
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,055
Since you've come so far, take the blessings and go

337
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,962
You believe in Makdoom Shah?

338
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,027
We all do.

339
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:17,470
Yes, the bond between police and Makdoom Shah..

340
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,240
..spans since the British times.

341
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,179
Two years ago there was a theft committed in Mahim..

342
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,212
..due to which one of our officer's job was at stake.

343
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,146
He came and sought refuge here, and..

344
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,345
..the thief turned himself at the police station.

345
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,047
...along with the loot.

346
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,256
The thief claimed that.

347
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:37,317
..whenever he tried to spend the looted money, he couldn't.

348
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,592
And the bond just grew strongen.

349
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,995
...between Baba and the Police Department.

350
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:47,300
That reminds me, our relation... meeting.

351
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,338
Shall we?

352
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:51,030
You look quite excited about this meeting.

353
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,568
You dyed your hair, didn't you?

354
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,310
Trying to look young!

355
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:57,676
You're young, aren't you?

356
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:58,772
But you look married.

357
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,016
Let's go.

358
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,376
Come.

359
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,021
Welcome, Singham.

360
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,454
How are you?
- Fine.

361
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:10,193
What would you like to have?

362
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,456
Actually I am full, but...mmm...

363
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,155
1 spicy omelet, 1 minced meat.

364
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,394
..1 bread-butter, <i>2</i> Cream rolls, 1 Veg-puff, 1 Pudding..

365
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:18,662
..and Ice-Cream Soda.

366
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,197
And you?

367
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,665
You?

368
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,668
You mean you're going to eat all this alone?

369
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:28,541
Yes.

370
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,274
And you'll order something as well, won't you?

371
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,509
If this doesn't suffice my hunger, I'll share whatever you're eating.

372
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:38,278
Singham..

373
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,447
..we've known each other since we were kids.

374
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,585
But I've just setup my Salon business.

375
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,059
I want to establish my own franchise.

376
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,323
I want to open-up four more branches of it.

377
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,193
There's much I still want to do in life.

378
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,496
So...l don't want to get into this hassle of marriage just as yet...

379
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,676
But mom and dad don't understand.

380
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,038
WOW!

381
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,370
I am not interested in getting married either.

382
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,013
What?

383
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,572
This calls for a treat.

384
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,711
Let's order proper lunch.

385
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,075
What say?

386
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,415
And don't you worn], Singham...

387
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:13,355
I'll tell mom-dad that I rejected you.

388
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,788
Because you've changed since you came to Mumbai.

389
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,688
You've become a corrupt officer.

390
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,588
No need to take the trouble.

391
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:24,066
I'll tell them that I rejected you“.

392
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,761
..because you're having an affair with someone.

393
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,299
You wander in pubs all night.

394
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,203
..with a glass of hard drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other.

395
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,500
Bajirao, don't point fingers at my character.

396
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,135
And what about the way you're clawing my character.

397
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,207
Corruption is a common trait in Police officers

398
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,270
I see.

399
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,214
Have you ever seen me taking a bribe?

400
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,477
Nonsense.

401
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:42,742
Rusi, bill.

402
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,312
Singham, I've to face the Lord.

403
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,152
How can I charge you money?

404
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,460
Rusi, be afraid of the God, not the Police.

405
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,729
Tch-Tch... You're a free-loader.

406
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,160
You should be ashamed!

407
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:03,173
This corrupt DCP who pretends to be honest.

408
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,505
. Freeloads at hotels!

409
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,238
I'll have to tell mom-dad about it.

410
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,541
Bajirao, what have you turned into?

411
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,674
I'm going to tell them.

412
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,150
I'm going to tell mom and dad about this.

413
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,754
Sister-in-law's really funny.

414
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,022
What's that?

415
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,187
Singham sir...

416
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:29,460
Hmmmmm

417
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:30,432
What's that?

418
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,230
She isn't interested in getting married either, just like me.

419
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,531
I suggest that you get married, sir.

420
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,104
You're not getting any younger.

421
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,538
Why do you have to remind me about it?

422
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,736
By the way, why are you all so concerned about my marriage?

423
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:39,640
Sir, once you're married..

424
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,110
“You'll go home on time, and so can we.

425
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:43,866
Have I ever stopped you?

426
00:21:43,892 --> 00:21:45,598
- No, you haven't...So then.

427
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,481
My wife's going to her native place tomorrow can I go drop her?

428
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,117
Rascal.

429
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:53,157
Go, but only <i>2</i> days.

430
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,519
Thank you, sir.

431
00:21:58,117 --> 00:21:59,619
Whatever you may say, Usha..

432
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,029
..Singham sir isn't married, but..

433
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:04,298
..he knows the plight of a husband.

434
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,360
- Learn from him.

435
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,337
Mother, as soon as I said I am going to..

436
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:10,237
..drop my wife at her village, not pick her up..

437
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,673
..he instantly allowed me.

438
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:14,502
What? Do I bother you that much?

439
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:17,514
Usha, he's just teasing you,

440
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,414
You don't know how Mahesh is going to..

441
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:23,647
..spend 10 days without you and Sapna?

442
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,112
Mother, these 10 days are going to be a ball.

443
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:29,456
I see. I see.

444
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,186
I'll stay there for a month.

445
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,092
Are you mad?

446
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:33,255
Mother, please tell her something

447
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,196
Come soon I am telling you beforehand, alright!

448
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:40,264
Inder...

449
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,366
...make a Manchurian Rice for me.

450
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:43,733
Check this out, Pallavi.

451
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:46,100
Sameer's going to be clean-bowled tonight.

452
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,342
Get ready to hear those three words?

453
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,344
I Love You?

454
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,505
Pay The Bill!

455
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,513
What's this charade?

456
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:55,308
Hey man, get them out of here.

457
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,581
They make it difficult for our clients to get here.

458
00:22:57,643 --> 00:23:01,113
Hey man...we won't move nor let him move.

459
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,764
Hey you Fools, this is a salon.

460
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,708
Move your bikes.

461
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,422
And you 'Made-in-China', I've told you before..

462
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,554
..that don't park your can here.

463
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,326
You're ruining my business..
- Madam.

464
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,298
If your business isn't doing well..

465
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:13,530
..then put up a Gujarati snacks stall.

466
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,300
We'll become your regular customers.

467
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:22,038
Madam, Like I already said, we won't move nor let him move.

468
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,372
Keep eating.

469
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:24,781
Give me your phone.

470
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,483
Who are you calling?

471
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:27,779
Her boyfriend.

472
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,115
Let her call.

473
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:32,486
We'll play 'Garba' with him.

474
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:47,493
Singham sir, my son's a big oaf.

475
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,234
Sometimes I doubt his mother.

476
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,537
Sir, the truth is we didn't know..

477
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,575
..our kids are upto such mischievous.

478
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:57,236
I see.

479
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,413
Your kids stay out all night on their bikes.

480
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,315
Don't you ever call and ask where they are?

481
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,513
These are their sensitive years, tended towards fooling around anyway

482
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:06,056
But isn't it the parents responsibility to keep an eye..

483
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,590
Aren't the snacks around here very famous?

484
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,320
Get me some please, really spicy.

485
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:15,461
Papa, I think we'll be jailed tonight.

486
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:19,397
Son, those officers who look strict outside..

487
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,631
..are corrupt on the inside.

488
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:24,270
You have fun. I am here, right...

489
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,742
I was saying...Singham sir..

490
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,236
Hello.

491
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,378
I was saying..

492
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,314
Hey.. - What?

493
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:33,577
Stop your father.

494
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:36,381
Otherwise he'll be on the receiving end instead.

495
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:37,420
I'm warning you.

496
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,581
You see, he's the one who taught me..

497
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:41,387
..this give-and-take business,

498
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:43,560
Now it's his turn to pay the penalty.

499
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,059
You see...Singham sir..

500
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:50,359
All this mess is going to harm my son..

501
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,801
..but, it won't benefit you in any way either

502
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,497
So...

503
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:57,737
...let's settle this matter with a little give-n-take.

504
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,484
Singham only gives, he doesn't take.

505
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,383
I know.

506
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,648
You fool.

507
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,650
Everyone apologise to Singham sir.

508
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,386
And his girlfriend too.

509
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,088
She isn't my girlfriend.
- What?

510
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:24,132
You fools, how dare you'll trouble his fiancee.

511
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,361
What's he saying?

512
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,698
She isn't my fiancee either?
- What?

513
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:32,337
You fools, you'll dared to trouble his wife?

514
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:33,703
Apologize! Apologize!

515
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:35,643
Please forgive us!
Please Forgive us!

516
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,203
Sorry! Sorry!
- Back off.

517
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:43,043
It feels like I'm still in Shivgadh, not Mumbai.

518
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:45,551
No FIR, no Charge.

519
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:47,418
You released them.

520
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,157
These kids can still be explained..

521
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,625
..by instilling fear in them.

522
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,695
But once they are jailed..

523
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:55,423
..they will fear no one and listen to no one.

524
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:59,135
And once they are tagged criminals..

525
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:01,165
..then crime follows outright.

526
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:04,440
And anyway, the job of police is to end crime..

527
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,404
..not criminals.

528
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,304
I wish everyone could understand your way of working.

529
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,479
That's my regret.

530
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:16,583
People consider Policemen their enemy, not a friend.

531
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,346
They're scared of us.

532
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,024
Whereas we work for them, not against them.

533
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:31,390
How about coffee?

534
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,429
You can meet Kishore as well.

535
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,060
Ok, let's go.

536
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,038
Hello. Yes, Daya.

537
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:41,576
Tell him to wait, I am coming.

538
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:43,646
"Coming?"

539
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,671
It's 11 :45 pm.

540
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,779
When 47,000 policemen stay awake..

541
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:52,112
..20 million Mumbai citizens sleep peacefully.

542
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,437
Guruji, you're making a big mistake.

543
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:48,576
Baba, why don't you explain Guruji?

544
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:53,646
Who am I to explain him?

545
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:58,282
We're here because of him, he isn't here because of us!

546
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:05,050
However, passion takes you from A to B.

547
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:08,598
But logic takes you from A to Z.

548
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,197
Yes, there's still time.

549
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,198
these new kids..

550
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,070
...that you're introducing in your party“.

551
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:20,038
...will ruin it all...

552
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,241
CM sir, please tell him.

553
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:24,174
Every seat is important.

554
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,211
Think about the alliance.

555
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:31,010
Your party can break its alliance..

556
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,487
..but I won't change my decision.

557
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:39,024
Guruji, in the Mahabharat.

558
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,462
..Abhimanyu was trapped in the quagmire.

559
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,565
If these new candidates get defeated..

560
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:46,762
..and come into power, I fear..

561
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:50,268
..that you'll be trapped in a political quagmire.

562
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:53,274
We are worried about you!

563
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:56,439
Two things.

564
00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:00,307
1- You'll aren't worried about me

565
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,950
2- I am not worried about myself either.

566
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,216
What's this?

567
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,385
What's this stubbornness?

568
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,085
Such pride.

569
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:11,953
Try to use your brains.

570
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:13,087
Prakash Rao!

571
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:17,066
Prakash Rao

572
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:20,103
Those who speak from the head...

573
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,729
..shouldn't be answered logically.

574
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:26,270
Guruji, think carefully and..

575
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:27,969
..make the right decision.

576
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:29,738
But...

577
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,384
Prakash Rao..

578
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,689
My children here, live with hope in their heads...

579
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,360
..and this old man, lives on faith.

580
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,395
Goodbye!

581
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,034
Guruji, you should've heard what they had to say...

582
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,773
I've to hear them out because..

583
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:05,572
because of the alliance government.

584
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:09,141
And in an alliance you need support

585
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:14,387
We will fight this election on our own, and win it on our own.

586
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,419
Complete majority, that should be our goal.

587
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,697
Singham, it's been two days.

588
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:24,796
There's no trace of Mahesh.

589
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:29,234
Brother, last call was made from Bhoirghat.

590
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:31,730
I tried calling him many times after that.

591
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:33,105
But I couldn't get through.

592
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,769
Bhoirghat.

593
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,551
We've found Mahesh's bike near Bhoirghat, sir.

594
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:47,152
I think he met with a serious accident.

595
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,384
But we couldn't find a body.

596
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:49,551
Search the entire area.

597
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:54,320
Sir, two days ago an unidentified body..

598
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:56,730
...was reported in the local police station.

599
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,327
He was shot.

600
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:00,998
I checked sir, it wasn't Mahesh.

601
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:03,763
Find out whose dead-body it is.

602
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,675
And Daya, don't tell Mahesh's family about it.

603
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:10,238
Okay, sir.

604
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:19,555
Sir, I think its best that you come down to Bhoirghat.

625
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,561
Sir, Inspector Prakash Patil.

626
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:36,765
From Bhoirghat Police Station.

627
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:38,736
Sir, normally no one plies in this area,

628
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:39,741
But for the past two nights.

629
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:41,436
..few people have been jumping into the river..

630
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,207
...with torch-lights and trying to find something.

631
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,440
When one of the locals tried to stop them..

632
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,039
...he was shot at by one of them.

633
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,698
Sir, there's an ambulance down here.

634
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,544
Sir, Meera Shori.

635
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,048
Here she comes...

636
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,651
...to malign everyone.

637
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,028
What's important is that the ambulance..

638
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,439
...which the Mumbai police fished out of the river..

639
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,238
...belongs to Vikasdham Trust.

640
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:57,303
..which is Satyaraj Chandra Baba's trust.

641
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,017
What other links will we find next.

642
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:07,420
..whose faces will we uncover, only time will tell.

643
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:11,689
But...another shocking fact about this incident is..

644
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,220
...along with head constable Mahesh Jadhaxﬂs dead body“.

645
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:18,598
...millions of rupees have been found in this ambulance.

646
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:25,241
Commissioner sir, who do you think is behind all this?

647
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,699
We can answer your questions.

648
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:28,403
“Only after completing our investigation.

649
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:30,242
But your constable's dead body was found..

650
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:31,212
No more questions.

651
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,304
So you see..

652
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:35,007
Even the Police Commissioner doesn't have an answer.

653
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:57,139
Take them.

654
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:09,509
Do you know anything about this.

655
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,518
Were other officials of police included in this theft?

656
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:12,577
Or was he alone?

657
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:13,489
We don't know anything.

658
00:35:13,515 --> 00:35:14,582
- You don't know anything?

659
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:17,389
There was a thief hiding behind that uniform.

660
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,587
..and you didn't have a clue.

661
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,571
How's that possible?

662
00:35:19,597 --> 00:35:20,655
- What are you doing?

663
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,491
She's lost her son and she's lost her husband.

664
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,228
And you're busy increasing TRPs for your channel.

665
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,066
We're doing our duty, sir.

666
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:32,467
I don't understand why are you over-reacting?

667
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:37,612
Could it be, Singham, that you're trying to cover-up?

668
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,113
After all, one of the constable from your team.

669
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:41,617
..was caught with millions of rupees.

670
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:43,175
He wasn't apprehended.

671
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,211
His dead body was found along with the money.

672
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:46,449
And we still don't know whose money this is.

673
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,616
So please improve your knowledge, Ms. Meera Shori.

674
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:54,025
Mahesh risked his life for all our missions.

675
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:55,688
He even took a bullet on his left shoulder.

676
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:57,392
But none of you were present then.

677
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,101
now when he's only been accused..

678
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,727
...and here you are with your cameras.

679
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,240
Your job is to collect information.

680
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:08,476
Not to give verdicts like a High-court or Supreme-court judge.

681
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,337
So please...

682
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,074
...do your job, and let us do ours!

683
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:22,288
The ambulance which the police recovered from BhoirghaL.

684
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,258
...belongs to your trust Vikasdham.

685
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,085
And a police constable's dead body“.

686
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:27,994
.. was also found in that ambulance.

687
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,994
Baba, 100 million rupees were also recovered from that ambulance.

688
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:32,433
Didn't you know about it?

689
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,560
Says who?

690
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:37,539
The ambulance was stolen from the Ashram a week ago.

691
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:39,470
My aides lodged a complaint.

692
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,737
..at the Azad Nagar Police Station.

693
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:42,478
You can go take a look.

694
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,238
You're asking rubbish questions.

695
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:50,352
Baba thinks our questions are rubbish.

696
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:52,079
Sir, Baba's trust claims that.

697
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,554
..the ambulance, in which Mahesh's body was found..

698
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,148
..was stolen a week ago.

699
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:58,126
And they had lodged a complaint at Azad Nagar Police Station.

700
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,422
Phadnis.
- Sir.

701
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:01,291
When did the ambulance leave Mumbai, what time..

702
00:37:01,353 --> 00:37:04,129
..and who was driving it, I want complete details.

703
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:05,497
..right up to Satara Toll-booth.

704
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:20,080
Hold on.

705
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:21,242
Rewind that pan.

706
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,316
Sir, we found this driver's dead body..

707
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:30,655
..near Mahesh's bike.

708
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:33,762
Singham sir, the same ambulance..

709
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,396
...plied through this booth 10-12 times.

710
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,064
I remember clearly.

711
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,124
Are you sure?
- Yes.

712
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,726
It belongs to Vikasdham Trust.

713
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,697
We never charged him anything.

714
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,501
..since it was an ambulance.

715
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,077
I want complete report.

716
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:52,445
..from Mumbai-Pune Expressway to NH4 toll-booths.

717
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:56,084
If we find out which direction this ambulance headed..

718
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:57,581
we will be proceeding in the right direction.

719
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,450
Sir, we've gathered the details about the ambulance.

720
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:02,953
Sir, the ambulance always crossed Wadhavpur toll.

721
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:05,652
But it never crossed Shahpur Toll-booth.

722
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:12,091
Between Bhoir Ghat and Shahpur comes Shivgadh and Wadhavpur.

723
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:15,427
So that's where the key to this 100 million mystery lies..

724
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:21,603
Mahesh always said one thing.

725
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,240
“I want to be like Singham sir.“

726
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:31,385
“I want to be an honest and good police officer like him.“

727
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:36,056
My son's dead, Singham sir.

728
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,525
My child.

729
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,259
Stay strong.

730
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:45,029
Singham...

731
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,264
...these allegations, people's views..

732
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:57,307
..had he been alive, it wouldn't have mattered to him.

733
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,642
But there was just one thing he cared about.

734
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,350
What you thought about him.

735
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:20,667
Usha, I was his senior.

736
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:26,275
But always felt like saluting him for his honesty.

737
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:33,740
And whoever has accused him of such a crime..

738
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:42,481
...I swear, I will make him suffer.

739
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:59,499
Bajirao Singham.

740
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:10,080
<i>"Singham."</i>

741
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,055
<i>"Singham."</i>

742
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,390
<i>"Singham."</i>

743
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,035
Bajirao Singham!

744
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,313
I've heard a lot about you.

745
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,348
I had a few questions.

746
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:44,744
Everyone comes here with questions.

747
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,447
But there's a difference.

748
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,616
If your devotees don't get an answer..

749
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,091
..it troubles them.

750
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:54,527
If I don't get my answers, then you'll be in trouble.

751
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,504
According to our investigations.

752
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:06,098
..your trust's ambulances was spotted 12 times.

753
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:07,643
..on Satara Highway in 3 months.

754
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,438
I am a benefactor.

755
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,614
And the ambulance is for helping people.

756
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:16,141
The ambulance scurries off to wherever it's required.

757
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,312
Then I am sure your ambulance must be blistered.

758
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:21,555
Because traveling 256 km daily“.

759
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,760
..is 4-6 hour long drive.

760
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,217
And this time is enough..

761
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:28,264
..for any patient to be reborn again.

762
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,293
I am pleased to hear you believe in life and re-birth.

763
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:33,665
Offerings!

764
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,068
There are many other things I believe in.

765
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:43,177
Like...you lodged a complaint for a missing ambulance..

766
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,579
..but not the driver?

767
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:48,178
What's your answer to that?

768
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:49,441
Hey, Singham..

769
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,678
.. what's this charade?

770
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,653
How dare you question Baba.

771
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:54,415
Him?

772
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:59,258
Prakash Rao, with power... come all kind of wrong ideas.

773
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:03,592
Too much light makes a person blind.

774
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:06,295
Hey, I am here to investigate.

775
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:08,298
..not to hear your stupid lecture.

776
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,168
What's to investigate?

777
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,196
A constable from your team was apprehended with money.

778
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,607
100 million don't grow on trees or fall from the skies.

779
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:17,510
And no one lodged a report of a theft this big.

780
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:20,310
That doesn't mean that Mahesh is innocent.

781
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,543
He must have killed the driver.

782
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:25,144
If that's true, then I swear to take this uniform off.

783
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:29,182
But if it turns out to be someone else..

784
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:32,424
..then I'll drag him like a mutt.

785
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:35,325
You dare misbehave with Baba.
Apologise!

786
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:38,634
Calm down! Calm down!

787
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,764
The 2nd Verse of Gita states.

788
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,469
..that anger makes a man delusional.

789
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:45,633
And a delusional man heads to his own downfall.

790
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:49,076
And the Indian Money Laundering act Section 4 states..

791
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:51,780
..7 years imprisonment for possession of black money.

792
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:56,045
And death penalty under section 302 for murder.

793
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,426
Now...

794
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,995
It's your turn now.

795
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:15,364
"The head tremors, body shivers.."

796
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,406
"..when you know he's coming."

797
00:43:17,462 --> 00:43:18,702
"Singham."

798
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:23,824
"No ifs, no buts.

799
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:26,436
Just chaos all the way."

800
00:43:26,471 --> 00:43:27,745
"Singham."

801
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:35,215
“Evil-doers are defeated and put down for good.“

802
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:40,088
"The good find refuge in his arms."

803
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,222
"He's like no other."

804
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,286
"He's full of valor."

805
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,162
"Singham is the destroyer."

806
00:43:44,222 --> 00:43:46,463
First Guruji, now Singham.

807
00:43:46,658 --> 00:43:49,264
Both of them are out to get us.

808
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,707
Baba, this guru-student duo..
- Prakash Rao!

809
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,536
Whenever the sun and moon come together..

810
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:59,477
..there's always been an eclipse.

811
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:02,642
Time will play its game now.

812
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,982
Because if man befriends time..

813
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:08,621
..it can take you to great heights.

814
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:13,294
But if it turns against you, then..

815
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,605
How long will you be gone?

816
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:25,605
Around a week.

817
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,405
It's election time and there's much to be done.

818
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:33,673
I'll put pressure on the Centre for Mahesh's case.

819
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:37,418
But no one will interfere in your investigations.

820
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:39,712
You can take any steps required.

821
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,151
Guruji, there's something I want to tell you.

822
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:47,229
I think Baba and Prakash Rao..

823
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:49,765
..are behind Mahesh's murder.

824
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:34,640
Guruji.

825
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:26,524
Calling Control!

826
00:46:26,584 --> 00:46:27,562
Calling Control!

827
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,292
Location; Cotton Green Station.

828
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:34,600
Send backup immediately.

829
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:36,263
Guruji's convoy has been attacked.

830
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:39,103
Sharad, look after Guruji.
- Okay, sir.

831
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:02,061
"Singham."

832
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,161
"Singham."

833
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,698
"Singham."

834
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:15,271
"Singham."

835
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:18,656
Singham.

836
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,128
Guruji.

837
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:23,035
Guruji.

838
00:50:23,788 --> 00:50:28,601
Party Chief, Gurukant Acharya was murdered in broad daylight.

839
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:32,741
Even after tight security.

840
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:36,210
..our police was unable to protect Guruji.

841
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,546
You're listening to Radio Mirchi 98.3 FM.

842
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:40,377
My name's Suren and with me is Meera.

843
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:44,044
And we just learned that Guruji was murdered today.

844
00:50:44,108 --> 00:50:45,314
The city is in deep shock.

845
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:48,782
Not just for the Mumbai police..

846
00:50:49,113 --> 00:50:50,592
...It's an embarrassing thing for everyone.

847
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:52,389
Due to the carelessness of the police.

848
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:55,363
..we've lost an honest and good leader.

849
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:58,158
Babaji, what else would you like to say about it?

850
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:01,202
Babaji will be observing complete silence for three days“.

851
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,397
..as a tribute to Guruji's soul.

852
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:07,307
Should Bajirao Singham be blamed for this incident?

853
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:10,104
What's this madness, Singham?

854
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:12,205
Resignation letter?

855
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:14,249
If I can't fulfill my duty“.

856
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:16,447
..then there's no point in doing this job.

857
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:19,386
But you tried your best to save Guruji.

858
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:23,721
Look, Singham, the public, media and politicians.

859
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:27,086
..need a target to vent out their anger.

860
00:51:27,151 --> 00:51:28,528
So they made you one.

861
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,061
They will forget in a week or two.

862
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,231
But I can never forget, sir.

863
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:35,635
The man who made me what I am..

864
00:51:36,627 --> 00:51:38,436
..is no more because of me.

865
00:51:38,796 --> 00:51:40,673
Singham, I hope you didn't take this step..

866
00:51:41,232 --> 00:51:43,769
..due to some pressure or someone's advice?

867
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,207
I did.

868
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:49,649
At my own advice.

869
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,612
Under my own pressure.

870
00:51:54,245 --> 00:51:56,191
Because I couldn't save Guruji.

871
00:52:01,052 --> 00:52:04,465
Another question amongst the plethora of questions is..

872
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:08,731
..what will happen to Guruji's candidate in the coming elections.

873
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:12,133
Can Guruji's candidate fight this battle without Guruji.

874
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,096
Yes, father.

875
00:53:43,154 --> 00:53:45,293
Son, are you coming to Shivgadh?

876
00:53:45,356 --> 00:53:46,232
Yes, father.

877
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,530
Come. Come.

878
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:49,400
You'll feel better.

879
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,337
It'll be a good change for you..

880
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:52,806
..from all the worries of the city.

881
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:56,203
And yes, Avni's coming too. Bring her along.

882
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:57,637
Why Avni?

883
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,772
She's coming to meet her parents.

884
00:54:00,037 --> 00:54:01,539
..so why not with you?

885
00:54:03,474 --> 00:54:04,509
Okay, father.

886
00:54:14,151 --> 00:54:16,062
Your parcel's ready to be taken to Shivgadh.

887
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,528
Have you finished packing?

888
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:18,532
Shall we?

889
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:30,205
Come on, here they come.

890
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:33,143
According to sources at T5 News Channel..

891
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:35,012
..we've received this head-wrenching news..

892
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:37,074
..that Bajirao Singham is fleeing from this city.

893
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:39,178
What?
- You cannot escape the keen sights.

894
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:40,745
.. of T5 News Channel, Bajirao Singham.

895
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:44,083
But before that, watch this skinny toad.

896
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:47,320
You can't figure out whether he's holding the mike or the mike's holding him.

897
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:49,261
Lying is his hereditary problem.

898
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,199
People never believe a word he says.

899
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:53,735
Hey..
- What?

900
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,135
Why you...
If you dare speak against Singham..

901
00:54:56,193 --> 00:54:58,230
..then lay you down on the grass..

902
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:01,105
..and light it on fire..

903
00:55:01,165 --> 00:55:03,441
..and telecast your pyre live on your channel.
- Avni.

904
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,706
Get lost.

905
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,470
What say?

906
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:07,559
What did you say about Singham?

907
00:55:07,585 --> 00:55:08,700
- Madam, you are not doing right.

908
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:10,636
You have assaulted T5 News reporter.

909
00:55:10,662 --> 00:55:11,768
- What did you say?

910
00:55:12,009 --> 00:55:14,751
You can see..
- Get lost.

911
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:17,516
Don't hit me. I'm a reporter.
- Leave him.

912
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:18,992
I'll seek my dogs on him.

913
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:19,993
I won't spare you.

914
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:22,360
I'll show this live on my channel.
- Go ahead.

915
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:23,762
I'll expose you.

916
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:26,228
You misbehaved with a reporter.

917
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:27,291
You assaulted me.

918
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,702
See, how this woman assaulted a repoﬂen.

919
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,637
What did you say?

920
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:44,481
I am getting very any"!-

921
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:48,023
Please tell our viewers who did this to you?

922
00:55:48,312 --> 00:55:50,690
It was DCP Bajirao Singham's girlfriend.

923
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:52,421
What did she do with you?

924
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:55,195
She assaulted me.

925
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:57,360
What?
- Do you see, viewers.

926
00:55:57,421 --> 00:56:01,335
Bajirao Singham's girlfriend assaulted one of our reporter.

927
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,098
We will..
- Yes, Pompi..

928
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:04,203
You know..

929
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:06,207
Your video's been uploaded on Youtube.

930
00:56:06,397 --> 00:56:07,467
What?

931
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:09,974
And you received more than 100,000 views.

932
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:10,705
Really?

933
00:56:11,268 --> 00:56:12,440
I'll call you back.

934
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:14,038
What now?

935
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:16,106
My video's been uploaded on Youtube.

936
00:56:16,173 --> 00:56:18,050
I've received more than 100,000 views.

937
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:20,213
I've been given a title on TV and Internet.

938
00:56:20,277 --> 00:56:21,415
Lady Singham.

939
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:23,014
What the..

940
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:24,582
Are you done?
Shall we?

941
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:26,218
I'll pay the bill today.

942
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,427
Why?
- Just like that.

943
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:31,526
Sit in the car, I'll pay the bill.

944
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:33,661
How much?

945
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,636
It's you?
Lady Singham?

946
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:39,107
Your news is being telecasted on television.

947
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:41,669
How can I charge you anything?

948
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,545
How about a selfie?

949
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,585
Thank you.
- Thank you.

950
00:56:53,177 --> 00:56:54,053
Let's go.

951
00:56:54,111 --> 00:56:55,112
Paid?
- No.

952
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:56,486
I ate for free.

953
00:56:56,547 --> 00:56:58,220
Of course I paid.

954
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,386
Come on.

955
00:57:17,234 --> 00:57:18,269
Bajirao.

956
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:21,506
They are here.

957
00:57:24,675 --> 00:57:26,211
How are you?
- My son's here.

958
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,277
Bless you.

959
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:28,986
How are you, Avni dear?

960
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:30,286
Hope you're well.

961
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:32,459
Come.

962
00:57:33,584 --> 00:57:35,154
Bless you.
- Bless you.

963
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,423
Bless you.

964
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:38,428
Father, I'll make a shod trip to Vadhavpur.

965
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:39,623
Vadhavpur?

966
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,465
Why Vadhavpur?
- It's something important.

967
00:57:41,592 --> 00:57:43,538
Take this car.
Give him the keys.

968
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,051
Balu.

969
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,057
Deliver these raw mangoes to the Bhosles.

970
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,755
You plucked the raw mangoes?

971
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:39,619
Yes.

972
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:40,684
Sit.

973
00:58:42,419 --> 00:58:43,727
Avni. How about some tea?

974
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:44,988
No.

975
00:58:45,055 --> 00:58:46,398
Mother, I'm going to Vadhavpur.

976
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:47,594
Vadhavpur?

977
00:58:48,492 --> 00:58:49,527
It's something important.

978
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:53,372
There's a temple on the way.

979
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:58,243
Avni's been insisting about going to that temple.

980
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,513
I did?

981
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,607
See, she said 'I did'.

982
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,684
Take her to the temple.

983
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:06,078
Go on.

984
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:29,666
Singham!

985
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:33,746
This is unlike my childhood friend.

986
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:35,377
You can come all the way here..

987
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:37,009
..but not to my house in Vadhavpur..

988
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:39,680
..which is only <i>2</i> miles from here.
- Vadhavpur?

989
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:42,383
Menka, Avni.

990
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,050
Kishore's sister.

991
00:59:44,114 --> 00:59:46,594
Hi, how are you?
- Fine.

992
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:48,288
I won't hear any more excuses, Singham.

993
00:59:48,452 --> 00:59:50,193
Let's go to my house.

994
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:52,427
We'll sit comfortably and have a nice long chat.

995
00:59:52,456 --> 00:59:53,400
Come on.

996
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:54,662
I'll drop Avni home.

997
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:56,565
She can take a rickshaw.

998
00:59:56,627 --> 00:59:58,072
You leave.
Come on.

999
00:59:59,029 --> 00:59:59,700
Tavde.

1000
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:00,764
Yes, brother.

1001
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:02,772
Take Avni home.
- Okay, brother.

1002
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:04,437
Come on.

1003
01:00:09,006 --> 01:00:10,041
Vadhavpur.

1004
01:00:10,307 --> 01:00:11,445
So this was the important work.

1005
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:12,678
Tavde!

1006
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:16,758
Come on, follow them.

01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:25,629
Tavde, speed up!

1029
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:28,564
Singham, I need your help.

1030
01:00:29,026 --> 01:00:30,334
Don't refuse.

1031
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:33,130
For the sake of our childhood friendship.

1032
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,472
What is it?

1033
01:00:34,531 --> 01:00:35,805
Hurry up! Faster...

1034
01:00:36,567 --> 01:00:37,511
Ashish.

1035
01:00:38,535 --> 01:00:40,242
I want to marry

1036
01:00:40,537 --> 01:00:42,676
But my parents are against it.

1037
01:00:42,706 --> 01:00:44,777
Why?
- Because we are Brahmins.

1038
01:00:45,042 --> 01:00:46,419
And he belongs to a different community.

1039
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:53,151
Tavde, faster.

1040
01:00:53,717 --> 01:00:55,321
But if you meet my father..

1041
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:58,122
..put in a good word for us, he will agree.

1042
01:00:58,789 --> 01:01:00,564
He respects you a lot, Singham.

1043
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:03,169
Okay, I'll talk to him.

1044
01:01:03,694 --> 01:01:05,002
Thank you.

1045
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:06,468
Tavde. Go faster.

1046
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,203
I am going fast.

1047
01:01:08,365 --> 01:01:09,469
Come on, come on.

1048
01:01:09,633 --> 01:01:11,442
How much faster do you want?

1049
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,479
Tavde.

1050
01:01:12,536 --> 01:01:13,571
Faster, faster.

1051
01:01:13,637 --> 01:01:14,446
Avni, I am going very fast.

1052
01:01:14,472 --> 01:01:15,369
How much faster do you want?

1053
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:17,351
Faster. Go faster.

1054
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,045
Hey, why did you stop?

1055
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:22,522
Avni, this is a rickshaw not an airplane.

1056
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:24,455
Do you have another plan, tell me.

1057
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:28,386
Drive slowly.

1058
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:30,227
I still have to pay installments of the rickshaw.

1059
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,649
These are village roads, not of Dubai.

1060
01:01:37,675 --> 01:01:38,755
What are you doing?

1061
01:01:39,229 --> 01:01:40,765
Menka, you go ahead...
I'll join you in 10 minutes.

1062
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,203
It's something important.

1063
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:52,083
Menka.

1064
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:53,587
Ashish, you?
- There's a problem.

1065
01:01:53,644 --> 01:01:54,645
What?

1066
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,184
I need to talk to you urgently.

1067
01:01:58,281 --> 01:01:58,948
Not here, let's go inside.

1068
01:01:58,974 --> 01:01:59,614
There's no one at home.

1069
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:00,594
Let's go.
- Come on.

1090
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:12,639
What happened, Ashish?

1091
01:02:12,696 --> 01:02:18,669
My parents have...fixed my marriage..

1092
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:25,278
..with Sheila, who lives in my neighborhood.

1093
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:27,244
What?

1094
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:30,519
This means that girl has cast a spell on your parents.

1095
01:02:31,148 --> 01:02:34,095
Useless! B***h! That Witch!

1096
01:02:34,551 --> 01:02:35,655
I don't care.

1097
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:37,357
Say no to this proposal.

1098
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:40,028
We've been in love with each other since ages.

1099
01:02:40,624 --> 01:02:43,434
Please. You know we've moved too far ahead.

1100
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:45,632
Do something.

1101
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:27,206
Truly Subhangi, I am very pleased.

1102
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:30,108
Our efforts have finally borne fruit.

1103
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,188
Yesterday Singham and Avni went to the temple together.

1104
01:03:34,244 --> 01:03:35,621
And both of them are missing today as well.

1105
01:03:35,779 --> 01:03:37,383
Not both of us, only Singham.

1106
01:03:37,447 --> 01:03:38,653
Avni, you?

1107
01:03:38,715 --> 01:03:39,693
Yes.

1108
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:42,491
Singham aka Vishwamitra is with Menka.

1109
01:03:42,686 --> 01:03:45,496
They've turned Vadhavpur into a weekend resort

1110
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:47,262
Singham isn't like that.

1111
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:48,598
Correct, he isn't.

1112
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:49,693
He's worse.

1113
01:03:49,726 --> 01:03:51,262
Father, uncle.

1114
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:53,406
Let me show you where Singham is!

1115
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:54,568
Come on, get up.

1116
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:57,571
Ashish.
- Yes.

1117
01:03:57,634 --> 01:03:59,238
You're such a coward.

1118
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:01,304
Anyone is bound to be..

1119
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:06,014
Menka, imagine if our families find out..

1120
01:04:06,076 --> 01:04:08,750
..that we meet secretly, what happens then?

1121
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,320
Hello, Menka.

1122
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:12,652
They found out!

1123
01:04:12,716 --> 01:04:14,252
They found out!

1124
01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:15,621
Menka.

1125
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,358
Hello! Open the door.

1126
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:21,733
Menka, I am done for.

1127
01:04:21,992 --> 01:04:23,596
I know...woo me.

1128
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:25,196
I mean...hide me.

1129
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:26,238
Where do I go?

1130
01:04:26,296 --> 01:04:27,070
Where do I go?

1131
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:27,665
Where do I go?

1132
01:04:27,731 --> 01:04:28,641
There.

1133
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:34,373
Menka.

1134
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:39,212
It takes that long...
to hide him.

1135
01:04:39,276 --> 01:04:40,095
Come in everyone.

1136
01:04:40,121 --> 01:04:41,372
Mother, father, come in.

1137
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:44,288
Now I'll show you what's unsuitable for family audience.

1138
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:46,554
Where are you?
Come out.

1139
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:48,755
Why this..
- Why not?

1140
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:52,361
He's going to be exposed in every way.

1141
01:04:52,422 --> 01:04:53,457
Hello.

1142
01:04:53,757 --> 01:04:56,499
The family audience has surrounded you from all sides.

1143
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,130
It's best that you surrender..

1144
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:02,476
See. See.

1145
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:05,737
Behind this white curtain is the twofaced man..

1146
01:05:06,102 --> 01:05:08,082
..that misleads innocent women.

1147
01:05:08,138 --> 01:05:09,708
..and preys on them.

1148
01:05:10,574 --> 01:05:11,644
He's the rascal. .

1149
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:12,709
Hey!

1150
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:14,417
You just can't interfere.

1151
01:05:14,444 --> 01:05:15,445
Interfere?

1152
01:05:15,545 --> 01:05:17,354
You're the one who's interfering.

1153
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,229
He's playing with you Menka..

1154
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:27,695
..and he even toyed with my emotions.

1155
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:32,500
Your name means 'Lion', but you're no smarter than a donkey.

1156
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:35,032
That night when you were about to tell father..

1157
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:38,136
...about your decision of not marrying, and I stopped you“.

1158
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:41,513
..you didn't understand why I stopped you.

1159
01:05:42,339 --> 01:05:44,341
Because I love you.

1160
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:47,317
I think about you day and night.

1161
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,284
I've been dreaming about marrying you.

1162
01:05:51,548 --> 01:05:53,550
And you did this to me!

1163
01:05:58,655 --> 01:05:59,793
Oh my!

1164
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:02,962
You are dreaming...

1165
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:06,407
...of marrying me?

1166
01:06:07,397 --> 01:06:09,434
Then...we'll have to talk to Menka first.

1167
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:10,500
Ashish!

1168
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:15,345
This means...
you were wooing her as well.

1169
01:06:15,405 --> 01:06:16,383
Rascal. Rascal.

1170
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:19,648
That means...
you two were having an affair?

1171
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:22,349
Yes, Avni.
And you interfered between us.

1172
01:06:22,412 --> 01:06:23,982
Let it be.
- What?

1173
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,585
But where's Singham.

1174
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:28,589
Here.

1175
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:32,495
Singham, these two were having an affair.

1176
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:38,129
You . . .heard everything .

1177
01:06:40,063 --> 01:06:42,043
Couldn't you tell me he's right here?

1178
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:43,270
What the...

1179
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:45,540
You guys are maligning a decent man.

1180
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:48,481

Sir, Daya speaking.
- Daya, Avni here.

1206
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:33,865
Avni, give the phone to sir.

1207
01:10:33,891 --> 01:10:35,193
- Why? What's so imponant?

1208
01:10:35,532 --> 01:10:36,567
Avni, it's urgent.

1209
01:10:36,633 --> 01:10:37,611
Try to understand .

1210
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:39,704
Let me talk to sir, it's very important.

1211
01:10:39,769 --> 01:10:41,180
Look, he's praying at the moment.

1212
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,274
Tell me whatever it is.
 I'll tell him

1213
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:45,285
Avni...l cannot tell you.

1214
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:46,285
So call him later.

1215
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:47,446
Hold on, Avni.

1216
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:51,715
Tell sir that Altaf's arrived at the Vadhavpur factory.

1217
01:10:52,182 --> 01:10:53,217
Who's Altaf?

1218
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:55,629
Just tell him, he'll understand.

1219
01:10:55,819 --> 01:10:56,797
Okay

1220
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:02,731
Singham, Daya called.

1221
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:04,227
It was something urgent.

1222
01:11:04,294 --> 01:11:06,535
He was saying some Altaf has arrived..

1223
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:08,166
...at the Vadhavpur factory.

1224
01:11:09,132 --> 01:11:10,406
Why didn't you tell me?

1225
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,037
Why are you reacting like that?

1226
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,106
Who is Altaf?

1227
01:11:16,139 --> 01:11:17,140
No one.

1228
01:11:17,407 --> 01:11:18,442
What do you mean by no one?

1229
01:11:18,508 --> 01:11:20,510
Who was Daya talking about?

1230
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:24,051
Singham, you're definitely hiding something from me.

1231
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:25,682
For my sake...

1232
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:28,552
...tell me what this phone call meant.

1233
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:32,590
Avni, there's something I hid from you and my parents.

1234
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:40,232
'There's someone here to see you.'

1235
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:45,373
'Singham we've learnt that Baba and Prakash Rao..'

1236
01:11:45,435 --> 01:11:47,039
'..are behind Guruji's death.'

1237
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:50,549
'Even if we arrest them, they are so powerful.

1238
01:11:51,074 --> 01:11:51,677
'..that they'll easily get bail.'

1239
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:55,086
'Five stories on five channels.
And zero evidence.'

1240
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:56,222
'Files closed.'

1241
01:11:56,279 --> 01:11:58,691
'S0 what's important for us is evidence.'

1242
01:11:58,748 --> 01:12:00,421
'Sir, you sent us to investigate.

1243
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:01,689
'..where the ambulance disappears to..'

1244
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:03,389
'..between Shivgadh and Vadhavpur.'

1245
01:12:03,453 --> 01:12:04,591
'We found out, sir.'

1246
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:06,634
'That ambulance goes to Altaf Khan's factory.

1247
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:07,565
'..which is in Shivgadh.'

1248
01:12:07,624 --> 01:12:09,661
'That's where Baba's entire wealth accumulates.'

1249
01:12:09,726 --> 01:12:11,262
'I am sending you to Shivgadh, Singham.'

1250
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,271
'Undercover.'

1251
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,399
'On this mission you'll gather evidence.

1252
01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:16,000
'..against Baba and Prakash Rao.'

1253
01:12:16,466 --> 01:12:18,446
I am still the Deputy Commissioner of Police..

1254
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,447
..and I've been sent here on a mission.

1255
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:23,640
I am here to catch Guruji and Mahesh's murderers.

1256
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:27,015
And today I'm going to lay my hands..

1257
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:29,056
..on those murderers sycophant, Altaf.

1258
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:32,015
Now I'll show them...

1259
01:12:33,316 --> 01:12:34,693
The only one, full of valor..

1260
01:12:35,618 --> 01:12:38,064
..is Bajirao Singham.

1261
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,340
Listen, this is 20 millions.

1262
01:12:46,396 --> 01:12:47,670
1000 each to every voter.

1263
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:51,041
And if our candidate wins, then 2000 more.

1264
01:12:53,169 --> 01:12:54,409
I had a talk with the headmen of..

1265
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:56,450
..Vidhan Nagar, Kabuli and Simanpuri.

1266
01:12:56,506 --> 01:12:57,780
They are with us.

1267
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,042
Sharad, leave now with the money.

1268
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:04,719
But remember, be careful of the election commission.

1269
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,716
If you're not attentive, mishaps happen.

1270
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:21,372
Singham!

1271
01:13:21,431 --> 01:13:22,501
Get him!

1272
01:15:04,367 --> 01:15:06,643
What did you think? 
I resigned?

1273
01:15:08,471 --> 01:15:10,576
What did you think? 
I was scared?

1274
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:17,523
Altaf, a lion spreads terror..

1275
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:19,992
..but a wounded lion brings upon havoc!

1276
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:23,187
I've been sent here to annihilate you.

1277
01:15:23,386 --> 01:15:25,627
I've been sent here to expose you.

1278
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:27,998
I was waiting to find evidence.

1279
01:15:28,358 --> 01:15:30,338
And I finally have it now.

1280
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:34,436
Now Prakash Rao and Baba's future is in my hands.

1281
01:15:35,331 --> 01:15:38,471
And when I open my fist and make a claw..

1282
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:41,481
..my enemy's throat will be in my clutches,

1283
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:47,711
I am Bajirao Singham. I am a Maratha.

1284
01:15:48,077 --> 01:15:49,681
Now you're all in trouble.

1285
01:15:50,246 --> 01:15:51,623
Straight up!

1286
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:54,458
Stan counting, your days are numbered.

1287
01:16:06,529 --> 01:16:08,600
Now I've lost it.

1288
01:16:18,207 --> 01:16:20,187
Well, it's hard to mention the exact amount.

1289
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:21,916
.. of black money that has been confiscated.

1290
01:16:22,145 --> 01:16:23,522
Whose black money is this?

1291
01:16:23,613 --> 01:16:25,524
Where did this large amount come from?

1292
01:16:25,614 --> 01:16:28,288
These questions can be answered by the person..

1293
01:16:28,351 --> 01:16:30,194
..who was arrested with the money.

1294
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:31,926
DCP Bajirao Singham's resignation was well-thought plan..

1295
01:16:32,188 --> 01:16:34,293
.. devised by the Mumbai's police commissioner..

1296
01:16:34,357 --> 01:16:35,859
..and Chief Minister Vikram Adhikari.

1297
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:38,201
Vikram Adhikari.
- Come, Rao.

1298
01:16:38,461 --> 01:16:40,600
You've played well.

1299
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:43,208
And not for one, but two teams.

1300
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:46,504
Rascal, you made us believe you were on our side.

1301
01:16:46,569 --> 01:16:48,549
...and out there you were supporting someone else.

1302
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:50,542
You've come at lunchtime.

1303
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:51,648
Would you like to have lunch?

1304
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:54,245
But how will you eat?

1305
01:16:54,744 --> 01:16:55,814
Dogs can't digest butter, and..

1306
01:16:55,878 --> 01:16:57,323
..thieves can't handle respect.

1307
01:16:57,413 --> 01:16:59,916
I am going to malign you now, Vikram.

1308
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,357
You were trying to expose us.

1309
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:06,230
Wait and watch how we expose you.

1310
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:10,400
Don't forget, that in this alliance you're just a..

1311
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:11,631
Break-off the alliance!

1312
01:17:13,896 --> 01:17:15,500
It doesn't make a difference to me.

1313
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,502
But remember one thing.

1314
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:21,810
Until the elections, the care-taking government is mine.

1315
01:17:21,871 --> 01:17:23,817
Fine, let's see what you can do.

1316
01:17:23,873 --> 01:17:26,149
You made a big mistake locking horns with us.

1317
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:28,688
You two made the biggest mistake of your life by killing Guruji.

1318
01:17:29,912 --> 01:17:32,825
When your sycophant Altaf gives his statement.

1319
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:33,820
..then you'll see.

1320
01:17:35,685 --> 01:17:38,188
You've gone on many trips with Baba, haven't you?

1321
01:17:38,788 --> 01:17:40,665
Now get ready for a trip to jail.

1322
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:48,607
So what if you didn't tell us, Singham.

1323
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:52,335
You were only doing your duty...

1324
01:17:52,935 --> 01:17:55,677
Listen, Avni's furious at you.

1325
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:56,647
Why?

1326
01:17:56,773 --> 01:17:58,218
"Why didn't he tell me earlier?"

1327
01:17:58,274 --> 01:18:00,413
She's furious over that.

1328
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:09,362
Aren't you happy that I didn't resign?

1329
01:18:13,222 --> 01:18:14,200
Balu. - Yes.

1330
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:15,726
Happy?

1331
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:18,800
I should be happy about the fact that I don't know anything?

1332
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:21,137
But nobody knew about it.

1333
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:22,364
What?

1334
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:24,675
Sol am no special to you, Singham?

1335
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:25,778
What?

1336
01:18:26,335 --> 01:18:27,871
Is this a charade?

1337
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:29,376
Get going. Leave.

1338
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:31,207
Where was I?

1339
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:32,417
You were right here.

1340
01:18:32,475 --> 01:18:33,715
No, I was saying something else.

1341
01:18:33,776 --> 01:18:35,653
Sol am no special to you now.

1342
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:38,791
At the restaurant, home, temple, Vadhavpur..

1343
01:18:39,181 --> 01:18:40,785
“Everywhere you were on duty.

1344
01:18:42,518 --> 01:18:45,590
And silly me, I was trying to lighten up your mood.

1345
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:46,856
Because I didn't want you..

1346
01:18:46,923 --> 01:18:49,335
..to feel bad after resigning.

1347
01:18:49,659 --> 01:18:51,764
And all the while you were on duty.

1348
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:58,175
Avni.

1349
01:19:00,603 --> 01:19:02,605
You might feel offended but..

1350
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:05,250
..if something like this happens after we're married..

1351
01:19:05,408 --> 01:19:06,785
...I still won't tell you.

1352
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:09,217
Because duty comes first.

1353
01:19:09,512 --> 01:19:11,651
..wife, children, family come later.

1354
01:19:13,616 --> 01:19:14,617
How rude!

1355
01:19:14,684 --> 01:19:15,924
By saying this, you..

1356
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:20,197
What did you say?

1357
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:23,269
After marriage?

1358
01:19:25,328 --> 01:19:26,306
Wife?

1359
01:19:27,463 --> 01:19:28,669
Children?

1360
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:32,403
Bajirao, you're really smart

1361
01:19:33,202 --> 01:19:34,681
What a way to propose.

1362
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:36,807
You said everything in riddles.

1363
01:19:37,707 --> 01:19:40,210
Now say those three magic words clearly.

1364
01:19:47,316 --> 01:19:49,455
Bajirao, are you feeling shy?

1365
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:50,763
Say it.

1366
01:20:00,663 --> 01:20:01,733
Now I've lost it!

1367
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:08,242
Baba, Singham's coming to Mumbai, with Altaf.

1368
01:20:08,404 --> 01:20:09,348
He was right.

1369
01:20:09,872 --> 01:20:12,648
"Now...it's our turn!"

1370
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:16,345
Baba, I want power, not imprisonment.

1371
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:19,321
As if I'm eager to be thrown behind bars.

1372
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:21,358
So why don't you say a prayer..

1373
01:20:21,417 --> 01:20:24,193
"perform a veneration to stop Singham?

1374
01:20:24,353 --> 01:20:27,766
Rao, your penthouse is on the top floor.

1375
01:20:28,591 --> 01:20:33,233
So you take the stairs or the lift to get up there.

1376
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:37,541
But I didn't take the stairs or the lift.

1377
01:20:38,367 --> 01:20:42,747
I stepped on hordes of dead bodies to reach this height.

1378
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:48,478
Bajirao Singham's days of doing good deeds are over.

1379
01:20:49,378 --> 01:20:51,790
Now the streets will be littered with dead bodies.

1380
01:20:52,615 --> 01:20:53,923
Littered with dead bodies.

1381
01:23:18,527 --> 01:23:19,505
Daya!!!

1382
01:23:23,632 --> 01:23:24,633
Shirke!

1383
01:23:34,643 --> 01:23:35,519
Move.

1384
01:24:02,237 --> 01:24:03,307
Sir.

1385
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,657
Get Altaf out

1386
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:50,686
He's still breathing, sir.

1387
01:24:57,159 --> 01:24:58,695
He must stay alive.

1388
01:24:59,495 --> 01:25:01,236
<i>"Singham."</i>

1389
01:25:04,233 --> 01:25:06,144
<i>"Singham."</i>

1390
01:25:06,402 --> 01:25:08,609
<i>"Singham."</i>

1391
01:25:12,908 --> 01:25:14,785
<i>"Singham."</i>

1392
01:25:15,377 --> 01:25:16,879
<i>"Singham."</i>

1393
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,460
<i>"Singham."</i>

1394
01:25:22,151 --> 01:25:23,789
<i>"Singham."</i>

1395
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:25,823
<i>"Singham."</i>

1396
01:25:53,182 --> 01:25:55,219
What you..

1397
01:25:59,288 --> 01:26:00,824
"Singham."

1398
01:26:39,628 --> 01:26:41,608
The wounds will heal in a week or two.

1399
01:26:41,697 --> 01:26:43,404
No need to worn].

1400
01:26:44,433 --> 01:26:47,380
Sir, Altaf has slipped into a coma.

1401
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:53,951
We've no clue about when he'll regain consciousness.

1402
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:56,585
Altaf must regain consciousness soon.

1403
01:26:57,846 --> 01:27:00,554
Otherwise, all our efforts will be wasted.

1404
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,200
Baba, according to the pre-poll suryey report.

1405
01:27:07,256 --> 01:27:09,702
...Bharatiya Lok Shakti Party is in the lead.

1406
01:27:10,359 --> 01:27:11,736
Guruji's new candidates are proving to be..

1407
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:13,466
..a hit with the masses.

1408
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:18,340
Guruji's death had the adverse effect.

1409
01:27:18,633 --> 01:27:22,877
Rao sir, Altaf is still in the special ward, under coma.

1410
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:25,750
Our men tried to get to him.

1411
01:27:26,141 --> 01:27:28,917
But Singham's arranged such tight security.

1412
01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:30,588
..that it's difficult to get to him.

1413
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:33,393
When all doors seem closed..

1414
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:35,394
..then you must open the window.

1415
01:27:36,552 --> 01:27:39,533
Singham's given security to Altaf..

1416
01:27:40,556 --> 01:27:42,729
..not to Guruji's candidates.

1417
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:48,739
Now we strike the hopes of Guruji's every candidate.

1418
01:27:48,797 --> 01:27:50,276
We'll strike them with fear!

1419
01:27:50,699 --> 01:27:53,236
And then we'll form our government.

1420
01:27:53,468 --> 01:27:55,675
How can you say he didn't come to school?

1421
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:58,683
I made him board the school bus myself.

1422
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:00,318
Are you sure?

1423
01:28:00,742 --> 01:28:01,743
Okay.

1424
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:03,253
Fine, fine.

1425
01:28:03,412 --> 01:28:05,392
His teacher's saying Adi didn't come to school at all today.

1426
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:06,686
The cleaner of the bus is saying“.

1427
01:28:06,748 --> 01:28:08,523
..that he left Adi in the school compound.

1428
01:28:08,584 --> 01:28:10,928
I think we should go to the school. 
- Yes.

1429
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:26,403
Mom!

1430
01:28:26,468 --> 01:28:27,412
Adi!

1431
01:28:28,904 --> 01:28:30,315
Mom! - Adi!

1432
01:28:33,208 --> 01:28:34,619
Are you okay?
Who did this?

1433
01:28:36,345 --> 01:28:39,224
Tell your wife to withdraw her name instantly!

1434
01:28:39,381 --> 01:28:40,382
Otherwise next time..

1435
01:28:40,449 --> 01:28:43,521
“You'll find your child covered in blood not his clothes.

1436
01:28:45,654 --> 01:28:46,689
Baby, careful.

1437
01:28:46,755 --> 01:28:48,234
Now eat.

1438
01:28:50,626 --> 01:28:52,401
I spoke to Neeta.

1439
01:28:52,561 --> 01:28:53,699
Adi is really scared.

1440
01:28:53,929 --> 01:28:55,602
He doesn't even want to go to school.

1441
01:28:55,697 --> 01:28:58,337
Whoever these people are, they are very dangerous.

1442
01:28:58,433 --> 01:29:00,310
You'll have to be careful.

1443
01:29:01,904 --> 01:29:03,815
I've requested for police protection.

1444
01:29:04,206 --> 01:29:04,707
By tomorrow hopefully...

1445
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:06,778
Mommy!

1446
01:29:41,743 --> 01:29:43,381
Withdraw your name.

1447
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:46,716
Otherwise, next time we'll crush you with the car.

1448
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:57,527
Hey, don't park there.

1449
01:29:57,592 --> 01:29:58,730
Sister-in-law will yell at us.

1450
01:29:58,793 --> 01:30:00,534
It's okay.
The salon's closed.

1451
01:30:00,595 --> 01:30:01,630
Yes.

1452
01:30:03,232 --> 01:30:04,472
The shutter's partly open.

1453
01:30:11,873 --> 01:30:13,944
Too hot-blooded, madam.

1454
01:30:14,309 --> 01:30:15,947
Your sibling - your brother..

1455
01:30:16,211 --> 01:30:18,714
...has been advocating his party a bit too much.

1456
01:30:19,147 --> 01:30:23,220
Tell him to step back, otherwise.

1457
01:30:23,819 --> 01:30:26,129
He'll have to pay for it.

1458
01:30:30,659 --> 01:30:31,569
What's going on here?

1459
01:30:31,726 --> 01:30:32,864
Get out of here.

1460
01:30:33,228 --> 01:30:34,298
Let sister-in-law go. .

1461
01:30:36,331 --> 01:30:37,469
Hey wait.

1462
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:41,474
Now I've lost it!

1463
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,209
Thrash them!

1464
01:32:36,251 --> 01:32:38,128
"Singham."

1465
01:33:11,753 --> 01:33:15,200
Since Guruji's demise, there's no one to lead the way.

1466
01:33:15,357 --> 01:33:17,928
So it didn't take us a moment to decide..

1467
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:21,471
..that we'll break this alliance.

1468
01:33:21,663 --> 01:33:25,440
After all, we've to win your heads through selfless deeds..

1469
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,740
..and give a fitting reply to the opposition.

1470
01:33:28,837 --> 01:33:30,714
..without lifting a finger.

1471
01:33:38,747 --> 01:33:40,454
Aye...Aye shut up.

1472
01:33:40,549 --> 01:33:43,359
How dare you attack our family?

1473
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:45,825
Don't you dare do it again!

1474
01:33:46,221 --> 01:33:48,258
Otherwise, next time I'll kick you..

1475
01:33:48,323 --> 01:33:49,893
“Publicly in your private part.

1476
01:33:50,659 --> 01:33:52,138
Why you..

1477
01:33:52,527 --> 01:33:54,507
You publicly. .

1478
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:58,640
Don't just stand there.
Arrest her.

1479
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:03,471
What are you staring at?

1480
01:34:03,672 --> 01:34:08,451
She assaulted a respected politician publicly.

1481
01:34:08,677 --> 01:34:10,213
Arrest all of them.

1482
01:34:10,345 --> 01:34:11,517
I can't arrest them.

1483
01:34:12,247 --> 01:34:12,884
Why?

1484
01:34:14,282 --> 01:34:15,488
They are all ladies.

1485
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:17,152
And according to the law..

1486
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:19,095
“Only lady officers can arrest them.

1487
01:34:19,221 --> 01:34:20,325
What kind of a law is this?

1488
01:34:20,588 --> 01:34:22,329
The judgment in the State of Maharashtra..

1489
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:24,836
..Vs. Christian Community Welfare Council of India.

1490
01:34:25,326 --> 01:34:27,499
In this the Supreme Court clearly states that..

1491
01:34:27,562 --> 01:34:30,099
..that a lady should be arrested by a lady officer only.

1492
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:34,237
Only a lady officer can arrest a woman.

1493
01:34:34,536 --> 01:34:36,812
This clarifies section 46 of CRPC.

1494
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:39,748
Where's the lady officer?

1495
01:34:40,241 --> 01:34:42,152
I've called them, it'll take time though for them to reach here.

1496
01:34:51,253 --> 01:34:53,199
Singham sir's just amazing, Daya.

1497
01:34:53,655 --> 01:34:54,599
He came up with a brilliant way..

1498
01:34:54,656 --> 01:34:57,500
..to humiliate Prakash Rao in public by getting him slapped.

1499
01:34:58,293 --> 01:35:00,466
Drive slowly, Daya.

1500
01:35:00,729 --> 01:35:02,299
What's the hum]?

1501
01:35:03,265 --> 01:35:06,337
If you ever touch my son again, I will kill you.

1502
01:35:06,401 --> 01:35:07,539
Get that?

1503
01:35:08,903 --> 01:35:10,814
Where are the lady officers?

1504
01:35:32,594 --> 01:35:34,335
So you are behind all this?

1505
01:35:34,529 --> 01:35:35,269
Rao..

1506
01:35:36,431 --> 01:35:38,433
..today you were blown out of your wits.

1507
01:35:39,501 --> 01:35:41,344
Once Altaf regains consciousness..

1508
01:35:42,337 --> 01:35:46,376
...I won't need brains, only brawn.

1509
01:35:46,541 --> 01:35:49,181
For that he needs to be conscious.

1510
01:35:49,344 --> 01:35:50,721
He's in coma.

1511
01:35:50,879 --> 01:35:51,823
Coma.

1512
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:53,716
And after what you did today..

1513
01:35:54,182 --> 01:35:57,129
..what do you think, you out-played me?

1514
01:35:58,286 --> 01:35:59,230
Go ahead.

1515
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:00,230
Play around with me.

1516
01:36:00,288 --> 01:36:04,202
But I am the umpire of this game.

1517
01:36:10,131 --> 01:36:12,543
Get the bail papers by 5-5:30!

1518
01:36:12,701 --> 01:36:14,339
I've spoken to the lawyer.

1519
01:36:14,469 --> 01:36:16,608
Daya, can I get something to eat?

1520
01:36:16,738 --> 01:36:18,183
I am very hung"!-

1521
01:36:19,441 --> 01:36:20,545
In the van.

1522
01:36:22,343 --> 01:36:23,344
WOW!

1523
01:36:32,353 --> 01:36:35,357
Sir, Mahesh's wife has been served a notice..

1524
01:36:35,423 --> 01:36:36,595
...to vacate her quarters.

1525
01:36:40,361 --> 01:36:43,433
This is happening because..

1526
01:36:43,498 --> 01:36:46,843
...people don't think Mahesh is a martyr.

1527
01:36:47,269 --> 01:36:48,407
They think he's a thief!

1528
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:49,778
A thief!
- Mother.

1529
01:36:50,405 --> 01:36:51,679
Be quiet.

1530
01:36:52,674 --> 01:36:54,847
I've made tea for brother, go get it.

1531
01:36:54,909 --> 01:36:55,717
Go.

1532
01:36:58,846 --> 01:36:59,916
Brother...

1533
01:37:00,715 --> 01:37:01,819
...please come.

1534
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:05,229
Please.

1535
01:37:05,854 --> 01:37:08,698
Brother, I've found a small hut at the back.

1536
01:37:08,757 --> 01:37:10,361
It's small, but we'll adjust.

1537
01:37:10,425 --> 01:37:12,962
I've also found menial jobs in few houses.

1538
01:37:13,228 --> 01:37:16,402
Sweeping, etcetera..
- Usha..

1539
01:37:16,631 --> 01:37:18,474
Can I work in your house?

1540
01:37:18,533 --> 01:37:19,221
I'll work properly.

1541
01:37:19,247 --> 01:37:20,333
- What are you saying, Usha?

1542
01:37:20,368 --> 01:37:22,405
Sweeping, cleaning, washing, I'll do everything.

1543
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:23,540
I'll do everything properly.

1544
01:37:23,705 --> 01:37:24,877
If I can get work at few more houses..

1545
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:26,618
...It'll be even better.

1546
01:37:26,641 --> 01:37:30,179
I've to pay Sapna's school fees and stock the ration.

1547
01:37:30,245 --> 01:37:31,290
I've to do a lot.

1548
01:37:31,316 --> 01:37:33,749
I'll even manage working in four homes.

1549
01:37:33,782 --> 01:37:34,556
I'll do everything.

1550
01:37:34,749 --> 01:37:37,195
I'll do everything properly.

1551
01:37:37,252 --> 01:37:39,232
I'll do everything“
- Usha!

1552
01:37:41,422 --> 01:37:43,402
I'll do everything properly.

1553
01:37:49,597 --> 01:37:51,770
I'll do it!

1554
01:37:53,835 --> 01:37:56,315
I'll do everything.

1555
01:37:58,673 --> 01:38:00,744
I'll do everything.

1556
01:38:10,352 --> 01:38:12,423
This is how our government.

1557
01:38:13,421 --> 01:38:16,197
..rewards honest police officers.

1558
01:38:19,728 --> 01:38:22,675
Make arrangements to send Usha and aunty to Shivgadh.

1559
01:38:23,464 --> 01:38:25,137
I'll talk to mother and father.

1560
01:38:30,605 --> 01:38:31,242
Sir.

1561
01:38:31,406 --> 01:38:32,510
Prakash Rads men are trying to..

1562
01:38:32,607 --> 01:38:34,609
..bribe the people of Shanti Nagar for their votes.

1563
01:38:49,457 --> 01:38:51,198
Sir, by the time we arrived..

1564
01:38:51,259 --> 01:38:52,863
..those distributing the money managed to flee.

1565
01:38:53,161 --> 01:38:55,573
But each one of them accepted 5000 Rs.

1566
01:39:09,511 --> 01:39:11,752
Policemen are dying.

1567
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:14,717
Their wife's are getting homeless.

1568
01:39:14,849 --> 01:39:16,795
And here you'll...

1569
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:22,392
You'll sell your votes for money!

1570
01:39:22,624 --> 01:39:24,331
Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

1571
01:39:24,392 --> 01:39:26,201
Let him go!
Let my son go!

1572
01:39:28,830 --> 01:39:30,605
I admit he took money.

1573
01:39:30,732 --> 01:39:32,507
I admit that he took money.

1574
01:39:33,401 --> 01:39:36,143
I clearly admit he did!

1575
01:39:37,572 --> 01:39:38,744
Will you arrest him!

1576
01:39:38,907 --> 01:39:40,284
Arrest him.

1577
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:43,486
But if tomorrow I get another chance..

1578
01:39:43,778 --> 01:39:45,416
..then I'll take money too.

1579
01:39:47,214 --> 01:39:48,921
Because it makes no difference to us..

1580
01:39:49,184 --> 01:39:51,221
..which government stays in power for 5 years.

1581
01:39:52,453 --> 01:39:54,194
What makes a difference is whether..

1582
01:39:54,289 --> 01:40:00,433
...we'll get a meal for the next few days, or not, sir.

1583
01:40:03,864 --> 01:40:05,400
We're worried today..

1584
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:08,404
...about how we'll survive tomorrow.

1585
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:12,342
My son.

1586
01:40:13,541 --> 01:40:14,417
Yes.

1587
01:40:14,609 --> 01:40:17,215
I know Prakash Rads party is a sham.

1588
01:40:21,316 --> 01:40:26,288
But our children's fee, medicines for the aged..

1589
01:40:27,155 --> 01:40:29,863
...that's more important for us, sir.

1590
01:40:33,494 --> 01:40:34,802
This..

1591
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:37,539
This...stick!

1592
01:40:37,765 --> 01:40:39,210
This stick!

1593
01:40:39,901 --> 01:40:43,439
How dare you flex your muscles on my son..

1594
01:40:43,671 --> 01:40:45,651
..to hide your own weakness?

1595
01:40:45,907 --> 01:40:48,513
How dare you hit him?

1596
01:40:50,511 --> 01:40:54,220
You think you're a man, aren't you?

1597
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:57,288
You know...

1598
01:40:57,351 --> 01:40:59,854
You know Prakash Rao paid us.

1599
01:41:00,354 --> 01:41:02,527
Then hit him.

1600
01:41:03,191 --> 01:41:04,534
Thrash him?

1601
01:41:04,759 --> 01:41:06,261
Do you have the guts?

1602
01:41:06,494 --> 01:41:08,371
Do you have the guts?

1603
01:41:09,564 --> 01:41:12,340
How dare you hit my son?

1604
01:41:14,269 --> 01:41:15,907
How dare you hit my son?

1605
01:41:38,392 --> 01:41:45,469
<i>“I am standing at Your threshold..“</i>

1606
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:48,340

1633
01:44:13,514 --> 01:44:15,020
Sir, got a call from the hospital.

1634
01:44:15,046 --> 01:44:16,418
Altaf has regained his sense.

1635
01:44:54,222 --> 01:44:55,724
This must be the first time..

1636
01:44:56,391 --> 01:44:59,338
..when a policeman prayed for a criminal's well-being.

1637
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:03,706
Whereas his own people are after his life.

1638
01:45:04,432 --> 01:45:06,207
I'll tell you everything.

1639
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:10,212
All the money given to Prakash Rads party“.

1640
01:45:11,606 --> 01:45:16,316
..for approving a project is deposited in Baba's trust.

1641
01:45:16,510 --> 01:45:18,615
And that money is transported in an ambulance..

1642
01:45:18,813 --> 01:45:22,192
...to my factory in Vadhavpur.

1643
01:45:22,249 --> 01:45:23,694
So that the money can be used..

1644
01:45:23,751 --> 01:45:26,664
...to buy votes of the people from different villages“.

1645
01:45:26,721 --> 01:45:28,496
..during the elections.

1646
01:45:28,856 --> 01:45:30,460
On April 16th...

1647
01:45:30,525 --> 01:45:33,096
I was taking that money.

1648
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:36,300
Suddenly, on the way, the ambulance broke-down.

1649
01:45:37,765 --> 01:45:40,644
And your...

1650
01:45:42,569 --> 01:45:43,809
'What happened?'

1651
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,217
'ls there a problem?
Do you need help?'

1652
01:45:47,274 --> 01:45:49,276
'It's alright brother, we'll manage.'

1653
01:45:49,610 --> 01:45:51,248
'Let me give you a hand.'

1654
01:45:52,347 --> 01:45:54,156
'I am not a thief, I am a cop.'

1655
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,226
'Come on.'

1656
01:46:05,126 --> 01:46:06,298
'Great.'
- 'See.'

1657
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:07,805
'Fired up as soon as it realized I am a cop.'

1658
01:46:07,862 --> 01:46:09,466
'Yes. Now, get down.'

1659
01:46:09,630 --> 01:46:10,904
'Where's the ambulance headed?'

1660
01:46:14,335 --> 01:46:15,405
'ls there a patient inside?

1661
01:46:15,469 --> 01:46:16,846
'Please get down .'

1662
01:46:22,176 --> 01:46:23,280
'WhaPs inside?
- Nothing.'

1663
01:46:23,344 --> 01:46:24,345
'It's nothing.

1664
01:46:24,545 --> 01:46:27,151
'Open the back door. 
Come on.'

1665
01:46:40,261 --> 01:46:41,239
'What's this?’

1666
01:46:42,697 --> 01:46:43,801
'What are you doing with all this money?'

1667
01:46:44,531 --> 01:46:45,839
'Where are you taking the money?'

1668
01:46:46,867 --> 01:46:48,346
'Whose money is it?
 Speak up.'

1669
01:46:48,802 --> 01:46:49,644
'Who..'

1670
01:47:34,382 --> 01:47:38,489
Baba and Prakash Rao killed Guruji as well.

1671
01:48:31,805 --> 01:48:34,149
"Singham."

1672
01:48:34,208 --> 01:48:36,415
"Singham."

1673
01:48:36,477 --> 01:48:38,616
"Singham."

1674
01:48:38,679 --> 01:48:40,716
"Singham."

1675
01:48:41,148 --> 01:48:43,458
"Singham."

1676
01:48:50,892 --> 01:48:52,872
Your sycophant Altaf's spilled everything.

1677
01:48:54,228 --> 01:48:56,333
You tried to end his life..

1678
01:48:56,897 --> 01:48:58,240
..but he will be the reason for your end.

1679
01:48:59,667 --> 01:49:01,647
You had constable Mahesh Jadhav killed.

1680
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:04,907
You killed Guruji as well.

1681
01:49:05,172 --> 01:49:07,778
What baseless allegations.

1682
01:49:08,209 --> 01:49:09,517
Haven't you read the Gita?

1683
01:49:09,777 --> 01:49:12,553
Those who are born, are destined to die!

1684
01:49:13,714 --> 01:49:16,718
Life is death, but in disguise.

1685
01:49:17,518 --> 01:49:18,792
Everyone has to die, your father as well!

1686
01:49:19,253 --> 01:49:21,859
Who at the moment, would be taking a dip..

1687
01:49:22,823 --> 01:49:27,431
..in the Gomti River of Shivgarh.

1688
01:49:29,496 --> 01:49:33,342
What if he drowns while taking a dip?

1689
01:49:34,535 --> 01:49:37,414
And your creator, your mother.

1690
01:49:37,471 --> 01:49:40,384
Who climbs 124 steps of the Shiv temple..

1691
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:42,511
...every morning at 6:45 am.

1692
01:49:42,676 --> 01:49:46,453
What if someone pushes her while climbing down..

1693
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:50,528
...she'll fall down, but will go straight to heaven.

1694
01:49:52,253 --> 01:49:54,199
And then, your sweetheart

1695
01:49:54,388 --> 01:49:58,598
Beloved. She goes to Mahim Church..

1696
01:49:58,793 --> 01:50:01,740
..every Wednesday evening to light a candle.

1697
01:50:02,163 --> 01:50:06,873
What if a car runs over when she comes out?

1698
01:50:09,804 --> 01:50:11,249
Slow down!

1699
01:50:11,739 --> 01:50:13,548
Slow down!

1700
01:50:14,208 --> 01:50:17,587
Hold your horses, Bajirao.

1701
01:50:18,178 --> 01:50:21,591
I know everything about you.

1702
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:25,196
And I've known everything about you since..

1703
01:50:25,253 --> 01:50:28,291
..you sold tickets in black Outside Gaiety Galaxy Theatre.

1704
01:50:29,390 --> 01:50:32,200
Operated a brewery in the slums of Dharavi.

1705
01:50:33,894 --> 01:50:36,670
Supplied girls in Saharanpur's red-light area.

1706
01:50:36,731 --> 01:50:38,472
And I still hold all the cards in my hand.

1707
01:50:38,532 --> 01:50:40,512
Like I had said..

1708
01:50:41,201 --> 01:50:43,704
I'll drag you like a dog.

1709
01:50:45,206 --> 01:50:48,744
Knock some sense in your brain, Singham.

1710
01:50:49,343 --> 01:50:51,254
Take some lessons about what's right and wrong.

1711
01:50:59,553 --> 01:51:01,897
I only give, never take.

1712
01:51:08,495 --> 01:51:09,906
How dare you slap Baba?

1713
01:51:10,798 --> 01:51:12,709
We'll see how you take Baba out of here?

1714
01:51:12,766 --> 01:51:14,336
Hey, move back.

1715
01:51:14,735 --> 01:51:15,770
<i>Babe!</i>

1716
01:51:35,355 --> 01:51:36,800
Daya!

1717
01:51:37,558 --> 01:51:39,299
'Lathi charge!'

1718
01:52:06,454 --> 01:52:09,560
Now I have lost it!

1719
01:53:24,098 --> 01:53:25,702
Baba is right!

1720
01:53:26,667 --> 01:53:29,170
Anger gives rise to delusions.

1721
01:53:29,236 --> 01:53:31,682
And delusions lead to ones downfall.

1722
01:53:32,506 --> 01:53:35,885
Singham's done so much in a fit of rage..

1723
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:39,420
..so he'll have to face the consequences.

1724
01:53:41,282 --> 01:53:45,128
The situation will heat up in the name of religion.

1725
01:53:45,185 --> 01:53:47,893
Down with Bajirao Singham.

1726
01:53:48,155 --> 01:53:50,692
Down with Bajirao Singham.

1727
01:53:50,757 --> 01:53:53,465
Down with Bajirao Singham.

1728
01:53:53,527 --> 01:53:55,268
Down with mumbai police.

1729
01:53:55,329 --> 01:53:57,240
Down with mumbai police.

1730
01:53:57,297 --> 01:53:59,903
Down with mumbai police.

1731
01:54:00,167 --> 01:54:01,305
Hail of Satyarajchandra Baba.

1732
01:54:01,368 --> 01:54:05,680
It seems like few political parties are turning the events occurring..

1733
01:54:05,839 --> 01:54:08,410
..with Baba into a religious issue.

1734
01:55:22,582 --> 01:55:25,119
It's terrible.

1735
01:55:25,185 --> 01:55:26,425
Look at what's happening.

1736
01:55:26,486 --> 01:55:28,523
It's terrible. Terrible.

1737
01:55:28,588 --> 01:55:32,434
This is injustice. Injustice.

1738
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:51,555
You..

1739
01:55:52,512 --> 01:55:54,355
As you can see, Altaf will be..

1740
01:55:54,414 --> 01:55:58,294
“Testifying against Baba in the court today...

1741
01:55:58,352 --> 01:56:01,458
...we'll soon know what new turn will this case take?

1742
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:48,605
What's going on, Adhikari?

1743
01:57:48,662 --> 01:57:49,800
What, sir?

1744
01:57:49,863 --> 01:57:51,308
The people are blaming the police..

1745
01:57:51,365 --> 01:57:52,867
...and election's just around the corner.

1746
01:57:52,933 --> 01:57:55,504
We'll have to release that Baba right now.

1747
01:57:56,403 --> 01:57:58,474
Issue transfer orders for the Commissioner.

1748
01:57:58,538 --> 01:58:00,643
And yes, that Bajirao Singham.

1749
01:58:00,707 --> 01:58:02,778
Order a departmental inquiry against him.

1750
01:58:02,843 --> 01:58:04,322
Sir, it's not his fault.

1751
01:58:04,344 --> 01:58:07,223
Adhikari, there's no barometer for right or wrong in politics.

1752
01:58:07,347 --> 01:58:11,227
What's right is right, and what's wrong is also right.

1753
01:58:18,191 --> 01:58:20,569
Due to lack of evidence and witness.

1754
01:58:20,627 --> 01:58:24,165
..Satyarajchandra Baba has been acquitted today.

1755
01:58:24,497 --> 01:58:25,840
Hail of Satyarajchandra Baba.

1756
01:58:25,899 --> 01:58:28,209
Hail of Satyarajchandra Baba.

1757
01:58:28,268 --> 01:58:29,906
Hail of Satyarajchandra Baba.

1758
01:58:30,170 --> 01:58:32,810
Hail of Satyarajchandra Baba.

1759
01:58:32,873 --> 01:58:35,877
For my special admirers..

1760
01:58:36,343 --> 01:58:39,483
Who write whose destiny.

1761
01:58:39,746 --> 01:58:43,888
...If the winds are strong, it can make the strongest trees fall.

1762
01:58:44,451 --> 01:58:47,398
Ignorant fool, you should understand now.

1763
01:58:47,721 --> 01:58:52,466
Only the best can survive here.

1764
01:58:54,161 --> 01:58:56,402
And after this incident we're receiving news..

1765
01:58:56,463 --> 01:59:00,468
..about the Mumbai Police Commissioner's transfer orders.

1766
01:59:00,901 --> 01:59:05,179
We've also heard that DCP Bajirao Singham..

1767
01:59:05,272 --> 01:59:07,582
...will also face departmental inquiry.

1768
01:59:08,675 --> 01:59:12,452
DCP Bajirao Singham was blamed earlier..

1769
01:59:12,512 --> 01:59:14,287
..regarding Guruji's security.

1770
01:59:15,415 --> 01:59:16,655
I guess this time..

1771
01:59:18,185 --> 01:59:20,165
I'm being pressurized from the Centre, Singham.

1772
01:59:21,855 --> 01:59:23,630
He'll definitely be transferred.

1773
01:59:24,858 --> 01:59:29,568
But don't worry, soon he'll be promoted to LG rank.

1774
01:59:30,197 --> 01:59:33,576
And the members on your inquiry panel are my people.

1775
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:35,871
So the outcome of the inquiry will be nothing.

1776
01:59:36,269 --> 01:59:38,408
As far as Guruji's murderers are concerned..

1777
01:59:38,471 --> 01:59:39,609
..they will face punishment.

1778
01:59:39,739 --> 01:59:43,152
But...we'll have to stay calm for few months.

1779
01:59:44,278 --> 01:59:48,192
Once the elections are over, we attain power.

1780
01:59:49,149 --> 01:59:50,457
Then everything will be normal.

1781
01:59:55,255 --> 01:59:56,325
Sir..

1782
01:59:56,890 --> 01:59:58,927
...he sounds more like..

1783
02:00:01,194 --> 02:00:03,435
.. a Don on the run, not the State's CM.

1784
02:00:05,699 --> 02:00:07,269
Guruji, Altaf, Mahesh.

1785
02:00:07,634 --> 02:00:10,205
We all know who killed them.

1786
02:00:10,670 --> 02:00:12,445
But what kind of political pressure is this..

1787
02:00:12,605 --> 02:00:14,482
..that is stopping us from doing our duty?

1788
02:00:14,675 --> 02:00:16,552
Pressing baseless charges against us.

1789
02:00:16,943 --> 02:00:20,322
Look, your anger is justified, Singham.

1790
02:00:21,415 --> 02:00:24,294
But we'll have to handle this situation practically.

1791
02:00:24,818 --> 02:00:26,422
I can lose my post.

1792
02:00:27,587 --> 02:00:29,362
You can lose your job.

1793
02:00:30,390 --> 02:00:31,733
Who are you trying to scare?

1794
02:00:32,826 --> 02:00:34,772
I am not trying to scare you.

1795
02:00:35,829 --> 02:00:37,137
I am just trying to explain to you.

1796
02:00:37,197 --> 02:00:38,301
There are few things we need to do..

1797
02:00:38,365 --> 02:00:39,708
..within the boundaries of this uniform.

1798
02:00:40,167 --> 02:00:41,874
Then what's the point of this uniform..

1799
02:00:42,135 --> 02:00:45,139
..which makes a policeman helpless, not strong?

1800
02:00:46,773 --> 02:00:50,482
Bajirao Singham is a man of free will.

1801
02:00:51,211 --> 02:00:53,418
Now I'll do as I please.

1802
02:00:53,780 --> 02:00:55,384
No one can stop me.

1803
02:00:55,882 --> 02:00:58,658
Neither you nor this system.

1804
02:01:01,154 --> 02:01:03,327
Rathore, talk to him.

1805
02:01:04,191 --> 02:01:06,228
He's being compulsive.

1806
02:01:06,426 --> 02:01:08,167
Explain him, do something.

1807
02:01:08,194 --> 02:01:09,298
Right away, sir.

1828
02:01:18,771 --> 02:01:20,250
What happened, CM sir?

1829
02:01:20,307 --> 02:01:22,309
Never seen so many cops without their uniforms?

1830
02:01:22,409 --> 02:01:24,116
Nothing can be done now.

1831
02:01:24,211 --> 02:01:26,487
They have all blown their tops.

1832
02:01:26,579 --> 02:01:28,354
We've all lost it now!

1833
02:01:33,153 --> 02:01:34,598
Avni, you talk to him.

1834
02:01:37,223 --> 02:01:38,133
Singham!

1835
02:01:41,127 --> 02:01:43,232
Don't spare those...rascals!

"Singham."

1857
02:02:09,322 --> 02:02:11,233
Yes. What are you saying?

1858
02:02:11,357 --> 02:02:12,563
Come on.

1859
02:02:12,692 --> 02:02:14,467
Someone else needs 3rd degree as well.

1860
02:03:03,744 --> 02:03:05,189
Let them come, Baba?

1861
02:03:05,412 --> 02:03:06,482
How many will come?

1862
02:03:06,747 --> 02:03:07,418
10?

1863
02:03:07,680 --> 02:03:08,420
20?

1864
02:03:08,581 --> 02:03:09,423
30?

1865
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:12,856
I've called 500 of my party-workers.

1866
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:24,159
Daya, break down the door!

1867
02:06:32,418 --> 02:06:33,396
Enough!

1868
02:06:38,224 --> 02:06:40,602
Singham, why are you beating me?

1869
02:06:40,793 --> 02:06:42,431
Why are you beating me?

1870
02:06:43,163 --> 02:06:45,609
Where did you bring this gang from?

1871
02:06:45,665 --> 02:06:48,669
Why are you beating me?

1872
02:06:49,335 --> 02:06:52,544
Look, I'll make things right for everyone.

1873
02:06:53,206 --> 02:06:54,344
Commissioner.

1874
02:06:54,574 --> 02:06:56,576
I'll make things right for everyone.

1875
02:06:56,776 --> 02:06:57,948
You go back.

1876
02:06:58,478 --> 02:06:59,855
Commissioner back.

1877
02:07:00,179 --> 02:07:01,385
Singham back.

1878
02:07:01,714 --> 02:07:03,387
Daya...you're back.

1879
02:07:03,483 --> 02:07:06,589
Everyone, the entire gang...back.

1880
02:07:13,359 --> 02:07:13,894
Hey..

1881
02:07:14,260 --> 02:07:14,965
Hey..

1882
02:07:15,295 --> 02:07:16,535
How dare you touch me?

1883
02:07:16,630 --> 02:07:18,837
Sir!
- Do you know who..

1884
02:07:20,133 --> 02:07:21,339
You..

1885
02:07:22,168 --> 02:07:23,841
Singham! You broke the law..

1886
02:07:23,903 --> 02:07:27,680
..in the presence of a respected minister.

1887
02:07:28,141 --> 02:07:29,814
You broke the law.

1888
02:07:30,243 --> 02:07:32,280
You will all be jailed.

1889
02:07:32,379 --> 02:07:33,687
You will all die.

1890
02:07:42,789 --> 02:07:44,632
Rao, you still didn't understand.

1891
02:07:45,625 --> 02:07:47,298
We're here to kill you two.

1892
02:07:47,694 --> 02:07:50,641
Why kill us, Singham sir?

1893
02:07:50,697 --> 02:07:52,574
I am ready to be the approver..

1894
02:07:52,632 --> 02:07:55,238
..and testify against Baba.

1895
02:07:56,936 --> 02:07:58,643
Brothers. Brothers.

1896
02:07:58,838 --> 02:08:02,718
He's used millions of black money in the election.

1897
02:08:03,309 --> 02:08:05,721
He's raped his female devotees.

1898
02:08:06,412 --> 02:08:09,825
He has buried dead bodies under his preaching dais.

1899
02:08:14,254 --> 02:08:17,724
And he's the one who killed Mahesh.

1900
02:08:19,492 --> 02:08:21,267
Why don't you also tell them.

1901
02:08:21,327 --> 02:08:24,536
..that who helped me in my endeavors?

1902
02:08:24,597 --> 02:08:27,476
Whether the elections, or illegal business..

1903
02:08:27,534 --> 02:08:28,535
..who invested money?

1904
02:08:28,701 --> 02:08:29,577
You did.
- I see.

1905
02:08:29,636 --> 02:08:33,482
And who killed Altaf? You.

1906
02:08:33,740 --> 02:08:39,315
And those four candidates of Guruji?
You did.

1907
02:08:39,879 --> 02:08:42,621
Who attacked them? 
You did.

1908
02:08:42,682 --> 02:08:47,791
And he's the one who killed a pious soul like Guruji.

1909
02:08:47,854 --> 02:08:49,765
No Singham, no..

1910
02:08:51,891 --> 02:08:53,871
No Singham, don't do that.

1911
02:08:54,694 --> 02:08:56,605
This country needs officers like you.

1912
02:08:56,796 --> 02:08:58,173
So what else should I do?

1913
02:08:58,498 --> 02:08:59,670
Arrest them.

1914
02:09:00,366 --> 02:09:01,845
So that they can be acquitted again.

1915
02:09:02,635 --> 02:09:03,841
I did arrest them.

1916
02:09:04,337 --> 02:09:05,372
But what was the outcome?

1917
02:09:05,438 --> 02:09:06,542
Riots!

1918
02:09:08,741 --> 02:09:11,551
The country makes one law to stop crimes..

1919
02:09:11,611 --> 02:09:14,217
..and people like them find 10 loopholes in it.

1920
02:09:15,214 --> 02:09:18,559
The superstitious people make such goons Priests.

1921
02:09:19,519 --> 02:09:21,590
And such thieves, leaders.

1922
02:09:22,254 --> 02:09:23,358
They should die..
- Singham!

1923
02:09:24,557 --> 02:09:26,332
What's the point in killing him?

1924
02:09:26,559 --> 02:09:28,197
If you kill him, 5 years later..

1925
02:09:28,294 --> 02:09:30,205
...people will erect a statue and revere him.

1926
02:09:30,263 --> 02:09:33,642
And if you kill him, he'll be called a martyr“.

1927
02:09:33,866 --> 02:09:35,504
...and his party will come in power.

1928
02:09:36,636 --> 02:09:38,479
Singham, change will come.

1929
02:09:38,805 --> 02:09:40,148
We'll take the first step.

1930
02:09:40,273 --> 02:09:41,809
We have evidence.

1931
02:09:43,142 --> 02:09:45,247
We'll show people their real faces.

1932
02:09:45,311 --> 02:09:46,654
And we'll get them punished.

1933
02:09:46,779 --> 02:09:48,690
They don't know the power of media.

1934
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:56,393
Daya, take the rascals away.

1935
02:09:56,923 --> 02:09:57,833
Come on.

1936
02:10:03,696 --> 02:10:06,609
Those police officers have broken the law.

1937
02:10:06,632 --> 02:10:08,202
So we'll have to take action against them.

1938
02:10:08,234 --> 02:10:09,907
What action will you take?
Tell me.

1939
02:10:10,169 --> 02:10:11,527
What do we tell the entire police force?

1940
02:10:11,553 --> 02:10:12,265
Ask them to resign?

1941
02:10:12,338 --> 02:10:14,215
This has become a national issue.

1942
02:10:14,373 --> 02:10:16,353
If we don't take a strict action..

1943
02:10:16,409 --> 02:10:17,479
..then we will be questioned.

1944
02:10:17,543 --> 02:10:19,220
But you know, so do we.

1945
02:10:19,246 --> 02:10:21,141
What they did was right.

1946
02:10:21,180 --> 02:10:23,626
The public and media are also supporting the police.

1947
02:10:23,683 --> 02:10:24,593
So what do we do?

1948
02:10:24,650 --> 02:10:28,689
I know...we'll let them off with a warning.

1949
02:10:32,291 --> 02:10:33,463
"Singham."

1950
02:10:34,661 --> 02:10:38,336
Bhartiya Lok Party has registered a historical victory.

1951
02:10:38,565 --> 02:10:41,478
After gaining majority votes.

1952
02:10:41,534 --> 02:10:43,810
..Guruji's prediction is coming true.

1953
02:10:43,869 --> 02:10:46,406
That the country is now in the hands of the new generation.

1954
02:11:06,492 --> 02:11:10,565
'We'll contest these elections on our own, and win it on our own.'

1955
02:11:25,277 --> 02:11:29,589
You're mistaken to think that you've won, Bajirao.

1956
02:11:29,883 --> 02:11:32,454
You see, you're part of the system.

1957
02:11:32,819 --> 02:11:35,129
And we are the system!

1958
02:11:35,421 --> 02:11:38,595
These verdicts, the punishment...

1959
02:11:38,725 --> 02:11:42,138
And me...chest pain, hospital and you..

1960
02:11:42,895 --> 02:11:45,501
High court, Supreme Court...and dates.

1961
02:11:45,698 --> 02:11:50,204
You'll be trapped and crushed in this cycle.

1962
02:11:50,303 --> 02:11:54,183
You don't know, Singham, you can't harm me.

1963
02:11:54,473 --> 02:11:57,716
Because humans are born to die.

1964
02:11:57,910 --> 02:12:01,448
And we're going inside...
to come out again!

1965
02:12:24,303 --> 02:12:25,680
"Singham."

1966
02:12:43,289 --> 02:12:44,529
What happened?

1967
02:12:45,425 --> 02:12:47,302
The car's broken down.
We're checking.

1968
02:13:08,314 --> 02:13:10,419
Will someone tell me what's going on?

1969
02:13:16,489 --> 02:13:18,162
Hey..
- Hey!

1970
02:13:18,291 --> 02:13:19,531
Hey, what...

1971
02:13:21,193 --> 02:13:22,194
Hey, wait.

1972
02:13:46,119 --> 02:13:48,497
'You know Prakash Rao paid us.'

1973
02:13:48,554 --> 02:13:50,500
'S0 go kill him.'

1974
02:13:50,556 --> 02:13:51,864
'Do you have the guts?'

1975
02:13:51,891 --> 02:13:53,529
'Do you have the guts?'

1976
02:14:19,652 --> 02:14:21,325
The car broke down on the way.

1977
02:14:21,387 --> 02:14:22,695
We got down to check it.

1978
02:14:22,755 --> 02:14:24,757
And a tanker rammed into the vehicle.

1979
02:14:24,824 --> 02:14:26,201
We were injured as well.

1980
02:14:26,325 --> 02:14:27,326
Right, Shirke.

1981
02:14:27,393 --> 02:14:29,532
The driver said that the tanker's brakes had failed.

1982
02:14:29,595 --> 02:14:30,596
We checked.

1983
02:14:30,663 --> 02:14:32,142
The brakes had really failed.

1984
02:14:32,231 --> 02:14:32,766
So it's an accident.

1985
02:14:32,832 --> 02:14:34,641
You can see that we were present at the accident spot..

1986
02:14:34,700 --> 02:14:35,542
Just a while ago..

1987
02:14:35,601 --> 02:14:36,773
<i>Sawarayzhandra Babe and ..</i>

1988
02:14:38,437 --> 02:14:41,281
A water tanker was heading this way..

1989
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:43,286
..convicted for murder to public figure...

1990
02:14:43,342 --> 02:14:44,685
Then the van was parked in the front...

1991
02:14:44,844 --> 02:14:46,790
There was a big explosion then they rammed.

1992
02:14:47,213 --> 02:14:50,353
And they both lost their lives in this terrible incident.

1993
02:15:12,405 --> 02:15:13,782
You will never change, will you?

1994
02:15:15,541 --> 02:15:17,521
That's Bajirao Singham's..
