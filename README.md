# NLP Analysis to Analyze Muslim Misrepresentation of Bollywood Films 

A machine learning model utilizing natural language processing (NLP) to detect Muslim misrepresentation in Bollywood movies over the past 20 years. 
This project is closely related to one of my first research papers I completed, where I used statistical analysis to highlight the increase in right-wing 
nationalism and Muslim discrimination through the analysis of Bollywood films. The model leverages TF-IDF vectorization, rule-based classifiers, and targeted 
sentiment analysis of movie scripts to detect linguistic signals across five dimensions, including terrorism framing, cultural regression, and gender-based 
oppression. This model uses the concept of the Riz Test [https://www.riztest.com/] to determine Muslim misrepresentation,
a similar concept to the Bechdel test. Full analysis on methodology will be available after publication.
